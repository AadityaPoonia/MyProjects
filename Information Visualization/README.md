# Multiview Visualization Project using Altair

I have developed a multiview visualization system using Python & Vega-Lite. The project encompassed data preparation, analysis, design, and implementation of three distinct visualization systems.

# Key responsibilities included:

- Selecting and categorizing a suitable dataset.
- Implementing three different multiview visualization systems with brushing and linking capabilities.
- Extending core functionalities with advanced generalization selection techniques.
- Comparing design decisions and conducting user evaluations.
- Documenting findings and proposing future improvements based on evaluation results.
