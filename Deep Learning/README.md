Project Title: Predicting Secondary Protein Structure Using Fully Convolutional Neural Networks

Project Description:
Developed a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) to predict secondary protein structures from protein sequence data. Utilized PyTorch for model implementation, and trained the model using a dataset of protein sequences and their corresponding position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs). The model was evaluated for accuracy and robustness.

Key Responsibilities:

Preprocessed protein sequence data and generated PSSM profiles.
Designed and implemented an FCNN with multiple convolutional layers for sequence prediction.
Trained the model using cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
Achieved model evaluation using metrics like accuracy and loss.
Deployed the model and tested its performance on unseen data.
Technologies and Tools:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Frameworks: PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy
Tools: Matplotlib for visualization, DataLoader for data handling
