    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThis revision petition is filed under Section 397 read with Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ('Code' for short) calling in question the legality and correctness of the judgment and order dated 14.01.2011 passed by the learned Sessions Judge at Bangalore in Criminal Appeal No.25012/2010, whereby the judgment and sentence passed by the learned Magistrate in C.C.No.28570/2007 dated 29.12.2009 has been confirmed, dismissing the appeal. Briefly stated the facts are, the complainant filed a private complaint under Section 200 of the Code alleging the committal of offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('Act' for short) by the accused. It was alleged before the Trial Court that the accused during the month of December 2006 approached the complainant and requested for financial assistance of Rs. 1 lakh as hand loan and assured to repay the same within three months, which was acceded to by the complainant.  The complainant advanced the said sum of Rs. 1 lakh to the accused towards which the accused issued a post dated cheque bearing No.429925 dated 1.3.2007 for a sum of Rs. 1 lakh. On presenting the same for encashment through her banker, the said cheque was dishonoured and returned with an endorsement 'funds insufficient'. The complainant got issued a legal notice on 16.3.2007 which was duly served. But the accused not making the payment demanded, proceedings were initiated under Section 138 of the Act before the Trial Court by filing the private complaint. On service of summons, the accused appeared before the court and having not pleaded guilty, claimed to be tried. The complainant got examined herself as PW-1, marked exhibits P1 to P6. The statement of the accused under Section 313 of the Code was recorded. In further defence, the accused got herself examined as DW-1 and further examined other witnesses DWs 2 to 7. Hence, this revision petition.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel Sri.B.A.Somanna appearing for the petitioner would submit that the complainant was doing chit business involving 40 members. The petitioner-accused was also a member in the said chit business. The complainant had paid an amount of Rs. 30,000/- to the accused and post dated cheque dated 1.3.2007 was handed over by the petitioner as a security towards the chit transaction leaving the amount blank. The testimony of DW-1 as well as other witnesses DW2 to DW7 clearly established the chit business carried on by the complainant. No loan was received by the accused, as projected by the complainant. Both the Courts below failed to appreciate the crucial evidence of these witnesses in a right perspective.  It is further submitted, similar proceedings were initiated against other chit business members who have deposed as DW 2 to DW 7. Despite the material evidence placed on record to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act, inasmuch as no enforceable debt liable to be paid by the accused to the complainant, no proper appreciation of the evidence being made by the courts below, the judgment and order impugned herein warrants interference by this Court.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nLearned counsel Sri.K.N.Mohan appearing for the complainant-respondent would submit that the complainant with all the sympathy to the accused who was living in the neighbourhood, advanced a sum of Rs. 1 lakh as hand loan on the assurance made by the accused that the same shall be repaid within three months. Towards the said transaction the accused issued a post dated cheque bearing No.429925 dated 1.3.2007 for a sum of Rs. 1 lakh.  The accused having failed to keep up her promise, the complainant presented the cheque and after complying with the procedure under the Act, proceedings were initiated under Section 138 of the Act. No cogent evidence was placed on record by the accused to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. Indeed, both the Courts below have extensively analysed the evidence on record, passed the judgment and order convicting the accused which do not call for any interference by this court.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nAfter considering the material evidence on record, the Trial Court convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act and passed an order of sentence to pay a fine of Rs. 1,05,000/-, in case of default, to undergo simple imprisonment for three months. If fine is deposited, a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- shall be paid to the complainant as compensation. 4. Being aggrieved by the said judgment and order of sentence, the accused preferred Criminal Appeal No.25012/2010 before the learned Sessions Judge, which came to be dismissed by order dated 14.1.2011, confirming the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the Trial Court. \n",
    "Case_Result": "I have given my thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused the original records. Issuance of the cheque Ex.P1 by the accused is not in dispute. The ingredients which are to be satisfied to attract Section 138 of the act are:There shall be legally enforceable debt.\n\n2. Cheque was drawn from the account of bank for discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability which presupposes a legally enforceable debt.\n\nCheque so issued had been presented and returned due to cheque has been presented within the prescribed period and dishonored.Section 139 of the Act contemplates presumption in favour of the holder. It shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved that the holder of the cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to under Section 138 for discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, the said presumption is a rebuttal presumption since the accused issuing the cheque is at liberty to prove to the contrary. This presumption under Section 139 can be rebutted by the accused by placing adequate and satisfactory evidenceThe initial presumption which favours the complainant under Section 139 of the Act can be demolished only by rebuttal evidence of the accused. The only defence of the accused in the present facts of the case is that the complainant was running a chit business and towards the chit transaction, the cheque Ex.P1 was issued as a security. On analyzing the evidence on record, including the evidence of DWs 2 to 7, on which much emphasis was placed by the accused, both the Courts have held that, except making the statement that the complainant was carrying on the chit business, no substantial documentary evidence is placed on record to prove the same. It is also true that admittedly if some similar cases are filed against such witnesses, their testimony is not trustworthy to rely upon Petition dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9bb1\n**Facts**: This revision petition is filed by the petitioners/accused under Section 397 of Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.,) assailing the judgment of conviction of sentence dated 26.02.2014 passed by the XXI Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore (hereinafter referred to as the 'Trial Court'), in CC No.10681/2010, which was upheld by the L Additional City Civil & Sessions Judge, Bangalore (hereinafter referred to as the 'First Appellate Court') in Crl.A.No.196/2014 vide order dated 30.09.2015. The complainant lodged a complaint under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'N.I.Act') alleging that accused No.1 is a private limited company and accused Nos.2 is its Managing Director. The accused approached the complainant and obtained a loan of Rs. 10.00 lakhs and executed an on demand promissory note on the same day. Subsequently, the complainant requested the accused for repayment and the accused No.2 issued a cheque bearing No.105306 on 31.08.2009 drawn on Karnataka Bank, Chickpet, Bangalore. When the cheque was presented by the complainant for encashment, the cheque was dishonoured for 'stop payment'.  The complainant issued a legal notice on 20.01.2010. The notice was served on accused No.1, but he neither replied nor paid the amount. Hence, the complaint came to be lodged against the accused. After taking cognizance, the presence of accused No.1 was secured and later, he was released on bail. His plea was recorded and he pleaded not guilty and the accused was put on trial. The complainant in order to prove his case examined himself as PW.1 and got marked thirteen documents. Accused No.2 got himself examined as DW.1. During the pendency of the case before the Trial Court, the accused paid Rs. 5.00 lakhs to the complainant by way of demand draft. Thereafter, he did not pay the remaining amount. Hence, the accused are before this Court by way of this revision petition.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: Hence, the Trial Court found the accused guilty, convicted and sentenced the accused to pay a total fine amount of Rs. 10,20,000/-. However, in view of the payment made by the accused to the complainant, the fine amount was reduced to Rs. 5,20,000/-. Assailing the same, the accused preferred an appeal before the First Appellate Court, which came to be dismissed\n**Argument by Petitioner**: . Learned counsel for the petitioners/accused contended that the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court have not considered the defence taken by the accused as he has paid Rs. 3,50,000/- to the complainant by cash after issuance of legal notice and that was not at all accepted by both the Courts.  Therefore, Rs. 3,50,000/- requires to be shown as set off but in the judgment passed by the Trial Court that was not done. Hence, prayed for allowing the revision petition.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Per contra, learned counsel for the complainant/respondent supported the judgment of both the Courts and contended that the accused paid Rs. 5,00,000/- before the Trial Court by way of demand draft and the accused No.1 being the Company, there is no question of accused No.2 paying Rs. 3,50,000/- by cash without any prior sanction or approval of the company. Therefore, the Trial Court has disbelieved the defence taken by the accused and has rightly convicted the accused. Hence, he prayed for dismissal of the revision petition.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Heard the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel for the respondent.  On perusal of the record, it is an admitted fact that the accused issued the cheque in favour of the complainant for Rs. 10,00,000/- towards the loan received from the complainant and executed an on demand promissory note as per Exs.P.1 and P.2. Issuance of cheque and stop payment as well as receipt of legal notice by the accused is not disputed by the accused. No reply was given by the accused No.2 to the legal notice issued by the complainant. After filing of the complaint before the Trial Court and even after making payment of Rs. 5,00,000/- towards payment by way of demand draft, the accused has taken the contention that he has already paid Rs. 3,50,000/- to the complainant prior to filing of the complaint.  But both the Courts have disbelieved the defence of accused No.2, being the Managing Director of accused No.1-company that he has issued the cheque for discharging the liability of accused No.1-company and he has executed on demand promissory note vide Exs.P.1 and P.2 in favour of the complainant in the name of GRS enterprises by its proprietor Sri C Narayanappa. The cheque was also issued in the name of GRS enterprises held by the complainant, which clearly goes to show the transaction between the accused and the complainant, the accused borrowing loan from the complainant and to discharge the loan, the accused issued the cheque. It is also admitted fact that during the pendency of the case before the Trial Court, the accused paid Rs. 5,00,000/- to the complainant by way of demand draft. \n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 04.11.2017, passed by the Principal City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru, whereby the respondent herein was permitted to withdraw the amount of Rs. 72,50,500/- (Rupees Seventy-two Lakhs Fifty Thousand Five Hundred Only) deposited by the petitioner pursuant to the order dated 04.07.2017. 2. The brief facts of the case are that the respondent herein initiated proceedings against the petitioner for dishonour of cheques amounting to Rs. 4 Crores.  The petitioner carried the matter in appeal before the City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru.  The respondent filed a memo seeking to withdraw the said amount. The petitioner filed the objections inter-alia contending that the amount in question being the compensation awarded under Section 357 of Cr.P.C., the same cannot be released to the respondent during the pendency of the appeal.  Learned Sessions Judge negatived the objections and by the impugned order permitted the respondent to withdraw the amount deposited by the petitioner. Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner/accused is before this Court.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, placing reliance on the provisions of Section 357(2) of Cr.P.C., and the case law in Irrigation Engineering Company (India) Pvt. Ltd and Another vs. The Small Scale Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) reported in ILR 2003 KAR 4339 with reference to paragraph 9, would submit that \"the word \"payment\" found in Section 357(2) of Cr.P.C does not refer to the deposit of compensation or fine amount by an accused in pursuance of an order passed by Appellate Court while suspending sentence imposed on an accused since, the word 'payment' refers to payment to be made to the person, who is ordered to be paid compensation and not the fine amount\". Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the view taken by this Court is confirmed by the Honb'le Supreme Court of India in the case of Satyendra Kumar Mehra vs. State of Jharkhand reported in 2018 SCC Online SC 270 and therefore, the respondent is not entitled to withdraw the said amount during the pendency of the appeal.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nRefuting the submissions, the learned counsel for the respondent submits that there being prima facie material to show that the cheque in question was issued by the petitioner towards the discharge of the admitted outstandings, learned Sessions Judge was justified in permitting the respondent to withdraw the said amount.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nAfter trial, the petitioner was convicted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the N.I. Act' for short) and was sentenced as under: \"Acting under Section 264 of Cr.P.C. the accused is hereby convicting to under go simple imprisonment for five months and sentenced to pay fine of Rs. 7,25,05,000/-, in default shall undergo simple imprisonment for six months.\\n\\nOut of fine amount of Rs. 7,25,05,000/- a sum of Rs. 7,25,00,000/- is ordered to be paid to the complainant towards compensation under Section 357 of Cr.P.C and the balance amount of Rs. 5,000/- shall be remitted to the State.\\n\\nThe bail bond and surety bond executed by the accused and surety stand cancelled.\" While admitting the appeal, learned Sessions Judge directed the petitioner to deposit 10% of the total fine amount.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 636a390c256c9ffed8242c9e\n**Facts**: This revision petition is filed under Section 397 read with Section 401 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, questioning the legality and correctness of the judgment dated 19-8-2005 passed by the Presiding Officer, Fast Track Court II, Mandya, in Cri. A. No. 86 of 2004 dismissing the said appeal filed by the petitioner herein and affirming the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division) and Judicial Magistrate First Class, Srirangapatna in C.C. No. 457 of 2003, convicting the petitioner herein for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short, the 'N.I. Act') and sentencing him to undergo imprisonment for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs. 2, 000/- in default to undergo simple imprisonment for two months and also directing the petitioner to pay compensation of Rs. 75, 000/- to the complainant being the value of the cheque. The respondent herein is the complainant before the learned Magistrate. I shall refer to the parties herein with reference to their ranking in the Court below. The complainant filed a complaint against the accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, inter alia contending that the accused for the purpose of improving his business and for repayment of his loan, borrowed a sum of Rs. 75, 000/- from the complainant on 20-5-2002 and for discharging the said liability, the accused issued post dated cheque bearing No. 480735, dated 10-3-2005 for Rs. 75, 000/- drawn on Allahabad Bank, Mysore Branch and requested the complainant to present the said cheque for encashment on 10-3-2003.  When the complainant presented the said cheque on 10-3-2003 for encashment through his banker, the said cheque came to be returned with an endorsement 'payment stopped by the drawer' and for 'insufficient funds' on 28-3-2003. Thereafter, the complainant issued a legal notice to the accused on 2-5-2003 informing the accused about the dishonour of the cheque and demanding payment of the amount covered under the cheque. Though the accused received the said notice on 9-5-2003, he has neither replied the notice nor has complied with the demand made therein. With these contents the complaint was filed on 13-7-2003.  After service of summons, the accused appeared before the learned Magistrate and pleaded not guilty for the accusations made against him and claimed to be tried. During the course of trial before the learned Magistrate, the complainant examined himself as P.W. 1 and got marked Exs. P. 1 to P. 8. The accused examined one Mahavir Jain as D.W. 1 to prove his defence and got marked Ex. D. 1. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of conviction and sentence, the accused filed Criminal Appeal No. 86 of 2004 before the Sessions Court, Mandya. The Presiding Officer of FTC-II to whom the appeal was assigned, heard the matter. During the pendency of the said appeal, the accused sought to produce certain additional documents by filing an application and the said application came to be allowed by the Appellate Court. Those documents were marked as Exs. P. 2 to P. 13.  Being aggrieved by the said judgment passed by the Appellate Court, the accused-petitioner has presented this revision petition questioning the legality and correctness of the judgment of the Courts below.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: After the parties led evidence, the learned Magistrate examined the accused under Section 313 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and after hearing the learned Counsel appearing on both the sides, the learned Magistrate by judgment dated 29-10-2004 held that the complainant has proved that the accused had issued the cheque in question towards discharge of legal liability due by him to the complainant and that the cheque in question has been dishonoured when presented for encashment and inspite of service of notice on the accused, the accused has failed to comply with the demand made therein by paying the amount covered under the cheque.  In that view of the matter, the learned Magistrate held that the accused is guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and accordingly passed the order of conviction and sentence as noted earlier. After hearing the Counsel for the parties, the Appellate Court by the judgment under revision affirmed the finding of the Trial Court and held that the accused is guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Taking into consideration all these additional documents, the Appellate Court proceeded to hold that these documents are of no consequence in the light of the presumption available under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 The Appellate Court also held that in the light of the presumption, it has to be presumed under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, that the cheque in question has been issued for discharge of debt or liability due by the accused to the complainant and since the accused has not rebutted the said presumption, the Appellate Court has confirmed the order of conviction passed by the Trial Magistrate.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: During trial, the defence of the accused was that he had taken loan on his vehicle from one Mahaveer Financiers and at the time of taking loan from the said financiers, he had given two blank cheques bearing Nos. 480734 and 480735 and on 14-2-2003 when he cleared the said loan, he took back those two blank cheques and thereafter those two cheques were found missing. It was also his defence that later when he received the notice from one of his ex-employee namely Shekar demanding him to pay the amount covered under one of the above two cheques, he came to know that the said Shekar had stolen those two cheques and the complainant has presented one of the two cheques. According to the accused, he was not due any amount to the complainant nor the cheque in question was issued for discharge of any legal liability due by him to the complainant.  Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner vehemently contended that the Courts below have utterly failed to see that the complainant has not proved the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability against the accused. In this regard, he contended that the evidence on record clearly establishes that the complainant had no financial capacity to advance loan of Rs. 75, 000/- as on the alleged date of lending, therefore, the Courts below ought to have held that the complainant had utterly failed to prove the existence of debt. He further contended that the material on record indicates that there was no agreement for payment of interest on this amount of Rs. 75, 000/- and this circumstance also suggests that there was no loan transaction between the complainant and the accused. He further contended that the Courts below have erroneously held that presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 would extend even to the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability.  According to the learned Counsel, the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is only to the extent that the cheque is issued for discharge of debt or liability and this presumption does not extend to the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability, therefore, the complainant is under an obligation to prove the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability as a matter of fact to the satisfaction of the Court. It is only if the complainant establishes the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability, then presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 to the effect that the cheque issued was for discharge of such legally enforceable debt or liability could be drawn. The learned Counsel submitted that in the case on hand, as the complainant has not placed any evidence worthy of acceptance to prove the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability against the accused, the Courts below are not justified in drawing presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and on that basis holding the accused guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. With these submissions, the learned Counsel sought for setting aside the judgment of the Courts below and for acquittal of the accused.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  On the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondent-complainant contended that there is sufficient evidence on record to prove that the accused borrowed a sum of Rs. 75, 000/- from the complainant and for discharge of the said debt he issued the cheque in question. In this regard, learned Counsel submitted that during the cross-examination of P.W. 1-complainant, there is absolutely no suggestion put to him to the effect that he had no financial capacity to lend a sum of Rs. 75, 000/-. Therefore, in the absence of any such suggestion, the learned Counsel submitted that there is no substance in the contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner with regard to the proof of existence of legally enforceable debt or liability.  Learned Counsel further submitted that the conduct of the accused in taking different stand at different stages would be a circumstance to hold that the defence of the accused was not consistent and acceptable. Therefore, having regard to the fact that the accused has admitted issuance of cheque, the Courts below have rightly drawn presumption available under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, as such, the Courts below have not committed any error in holding the accused guilty of the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. With these contentions, the learned Counsel sought for dismissal of the petition. Learned Counsel for the complainant contended that in addition to agriculture, the complainant also had income from milk business. Assuming that the complainant was also doing milk business, that cannot be considered as a separate income. \n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: . I have heard the learned Counsel appearing on both sides. . Perusal of the judgment of the Trial Court indicates that the learned Magistrate after referring to the oral evidence of P.W. 1 and D.W. 1 has gone on to state that the defence of the accused that he had delivered two blank cheques to the financier and that he got those two blank cheques returned from the financier and thereafter those two cheques were stolen by his ex-employee D. Shekar, who later delivered one of them to the complainant, who in turn presented the said cheque by filling the blanks, cannot be accepted, as the defence of the accused is not consistent and acceptable. The Trial Magistrate having regard to the fact that the accused has admitted his signature on the cheque in question has proceeded to draw presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and has observed that as per Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that the holder of a cheque received the cheque for the discharge in whole or part of any debt or other liability. From the records of the Trial Court, it is noticed that in the Trial Court the accused did not produce any documentary evidence in support of his contention that the complainant had no financial capacity to lend a sum of Rs. 75, 000/- on the alleged date of lending. However, during cross-examination of P.W. 1, certain answers have been elicited in this regard. Before the Appellate Court, the accused produced certain documents to prove the aforesaid contention. The Appellate Court after hearing the objections of the respondent-complainant allowed the said application by an order and the said order was not questioned. Thereafter, since the complainant-respondent submitted before the Appellate Court that he has no objection to mark those documents and that he does not dispute the contents thereof, those documents were marked by consent and parties did not choose to lead any oral evidence on those documents.  In the light of the above, it is necessary to find out as to what is the position in law about presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and to what extent presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 extends. Thus from the observations extracted above, it is clear that presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is only to the extent that the cheque was drawn for discharge in full or in part of any debt or other liability and the said presumption do not relate to the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability. Therefore, before drawing the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, it is the duty of the Court to see whether or not the complainant has discharged his initial burden as to existence of legally enforceable debt. No doubt, as per Section 118(a) of the Act, there is a rebuttable presumption that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration and when such instrument is accepted, it shall be presumed that it was accepted for consideration. According to clause (b) of Section 118, there is a presumption that every negotiable instrument bearing a date was made or drawn on such date. 20. Reading of both clauses (a) and (b) of Section 118 together makes it clear that as per the presumption under these clauses, the consideration is supposed to have been received on the date of the cheque. If in a given case from the apparent averment or from the evidence of the drawee of the cheque it can be gathered that on the apparent date of the cheque no consideration was paid or in other words if according to the specific case of the drawee or holder in due course of a cheque, loan was taken on a particular day and for the discharge of the same, on a later date the loanee issued the cheque, the presumption under Section 118(a) stand rebutted.  In the light of the above, if from the very averments made in the complaint or from the specific case of the drawee of the cheque, or from other materials on record, it is clear that no consideration was paid on the purported date of the cheque, it would be proper on the part of the Court to hold that the presumption under Section 118(a) of the Act has stood rebutted even if the accused has not entered the witness-box.  In the above reported decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court considering various circumstances such as the complainants inability to show his source of income so as to enable him to advance a huge loan; non-production of book of accounts; absence of proof to show that the complainant got so much money from the Bank; absence of any written document evidencing lending of money; absence of any witness to the transaction; non-compliance of provisions of Section 269-SS of the Income-tax Act, 1961 which directs that any advance taken by way of any loan of more than Rs. 20, 000/- should be made only by way of an Account Payee cheque, has set aside the conviction recorded against the accused therein. Before concluding the matter, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has also noticed the difficulty of proving a negative.   In the case on hand also, both the Courts below after holding that the evidence on record shows that the accused has issued the cheque in question, have proceeded to draw presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, even with regard to existence of legally enforceable debt or liability. In the light of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to above, the reasoning of the Courts below in this case cannot be held as legal and proper. The Courts below have not made any endeavour to find out as to whether or not the presumption under Section 118(a) of the Act has stood rebutted and if so, whether the complainant has proved the existence of any legally enforceable debt or liability. Without recording a finding on this aspect of the matter, the Courts below were not justified in drawing presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  Therefore, let me consider the evidence on record to find out as to whether the complainant has proved the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability so as to draw presumption under Section 139 of the Act.  According to the case of the complainant, on 20-5-2002, the accused borrowed from him a sum of Rs. 75, 000/- for improvement of his business and discharge of that debt on the same day the accused issued the cheque in question but requested him to present the said cheque for encashment on 10-3-2003. Accordingly, when the said cheque was presented on 10-3-2003 the same came to be dishonoured with an endorsement 'payment stopped by the drawer\". The complainant has reiterated these facts in his examination-in-chief by way of affidavit. Except the self-serving statement of the complainant that on the date of lending the money itself, the accused issued the cheque in question, there is no other evidence to substantiate the same. Admittedly the cheque bears the date as 10-3-2003. Therefore, as per clause (b) of Section 118 of the Act, it has to be presumed that the cheque was drawn on 10-3-2003. Admittedly, no consideration as paid by the complainant to the accused on 10-3-2003. In view of this, the statutory presumption under Section 118(a) of the Act has stood rebutted.  Therefore, the complainant was under an obligation to prove the existence of the debt by convincing evidence. Even according to the complainant there was no documentary evidence to prove lending of money of Rs. 75, 000/- to the accused and accused has not executed any document evidencing receipt of money as loan. In the cross-examination, certain suggestions have been put to him to the effect that he does not have annual income of more than Rs. 10, 000/- from his agricultural land. According to him, he owns 3/4 acre of agricultural land. In addition to the agriculture, he also does milk business. In the further cross-examination, he has admitted that a house has been allotted to him under Ashreya Scheme. He has denied the suggestion that he has falsely deposed that he has lent a sum of Rs. 75, 000/- to the accused. Apart from his oral evidence, the complainant has not placed any other evidence to prove the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability. As noticed above, there is no documentary evidence in proof of lending of Rs. 75, 000/-. The documents which are marked in the Appellate Court are the certified copies. Ex. D. 9 is a certificate issued in Form F by the Tahsildar, Srirangapatna Taluk. According to the contents of Ex. D. 9, the complainant belongs to Madiwal caste coming under Group II-A and he has annual income of Rs. 9, 000/-. This certificate is dated 23-2-2002. Ex. D. 10 is the copy of the mortgage deed executed by the appellant in favour of the Government in Form 3 drawn under Rajiv Gandhi Rural Housing Scheme. As per the contents of Ex. D. 10, the complainant has mortgaged the site allotted to him under Ashreya Scheme as security for loan of Rs. 10, 000/- availed by him for the purpose of construction of the house on the site. Ex. D. 11 is the allotment order under Ashreya Housing Scheme issued by Zilla Panchayat, Mandya.  According to the contents of Ex. D. 11, complainant was allotted house under Ashreya Scheme in Koppal Village. It is stated in Ex. D. 11 that the allottee is a person belonging to below poverty line. According to Ex. D. 11, persons whose annual income is less than Rs. 11, 800/- are entitled for allotment. Exs. D. 10 and D. 11 are dated 16-3-2002. As noticed earlier, according to the complainant, he lent a sum of Rs. 75, 000/- to the accused on 20-5-2002. The complainant has not disputed the correctness of Exs. D. 9 to D. 11. If according to Exs. D. 9 to D. 11, the annual income of the complainant was hardly Rs. 9, 000/- and he is a person belonging to below poverty line, it is not explained as to how he could muster his resources to pay Rs. 75, 000/- as loan to the accused on 20-5-2002. If the annual income of the complainant as on 22-3-2002 was hardly Rs. 9, 000/-, within three months thereafter namely on 20-5-2002 how he could lend a sum of Rs. 75, 000/- to the accused is not explained. These circumstances, in my considered view, would clearly indicate that the complainant was not in a financial position to lend Rs. 75, 000/- to the accused as sought to be contended by him. The income declared in Ex. D. 9 is the income of the complainant from all sources, whether it is agricultural income or income from milk business or from any other avocation. Having got the declaration that his annual income was only Rs. 9, 000/- as on 20-3-2002, it does not lie in the mouth of the complainant to contend that he had higher income from other sources. He cannot declare lesser income for the purpose of getting the benefit from the Government meant for persons in the category of below poverty line and later turn around and say that he had Rs. 75, 000/- to give it as a loan. Therefore, there is no substance in this contention.  The complainant has also not established as to when and how he collected this amount of Rs. 75, 000/- as on 20-5-2002 for lending to the accused. In addition to this, it is also pertinent to note that according to the complainant, he lent Rs. 75, 000/- on 20-5-2002. The amount was sought to be repaid by the accused on 10-3-2003 as according to the complainant, the accused requested him to present the cheque only on 10-3-2003 nearly about 10 months later. If a substantial amount of Rs. 75, 000/- had been lent, in the usual course of business transaction it is reasonable to presume that there would be an agreement for payment of interest. Why the complainant should lend a substantial amount of Rs. 75, 000/- to the accused without charging interest. The complainant in his oral evidence has not stated anything as to why payment of interest was not agreed. Thus, the circumstances of not charging any interest was also considered as the relevant circumstance to find out as to whether the existence of the debt has been proved or not. In the case on hand also, not only no document has been executed even, no interest has been charged. No explanation is forthcoming from the complainant as to why interest was not charged on Rs. 75, 000/- alleged to have been lent by him for a period of nearly 10 months. No prudent man, in my considered view, would lend substantial amount of Rs. 75, 000/- without charging interest. Admittedly, provisions of Section 269-SS of Income-tax Act has not been followed, as it is not the case of the complainant that, the loan of Rs. 75, 000/- was advanced by means of Account Payee cheque. Having regard to the evidence on record, I am of the considered view that the complainant has not established nor proved the existence of legally enforceable debt, against the accused appellant. The Courts below more particularly, the Appellate Court before whom the additional documents were produced has not directed itself in this regard to find out as to whether the complainant has proved the existence of legally enforceable debt. Both the Trial Court and the Appellate Court have mainly proceeded to consider the conduct of the accused. In my considered view, before considering the conduct of the accused to find out as to whether or not he has been able to rebut the statutory presumption available under Section 139, the Courts ought to have considered as to whether the complainant has proved the existence of legally enforceable debt. It is only after satisfying that the complainant has proved existence of legally enforceable debt or liability, the Courts could have proceeded to draw presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and thereafter find out as to whether or not the accused has rebutted the said presumption.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "**ALLOWED**\n\nThe main issue of the case revolves around the legality of the respondent's withdrawal of the deposited fine amount during the pendency of the appeal under Section 357 of the Cr.P.C, given the petitioner's conviction under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. The lower court's judgment permitted the respondent to withdraw the amount, relying on the prima facie evidence that the cheque in question was issued for discharging the admitted outstandings.\n\nIn our analysis, the lower court's decision seems to be in conflict with the clear provisions of Section 357(2) of the Cr.P.C. The word \"payment\" in this context refers to the compensation awarded, not the fine amount deposited by the petitioner. This interpretation is further affirmed by the case law of Irrigation Engineering Company (India) Pvt. Ltd vs. SIDBI and the recent ruling in Satyendra Kumar Mehra vs. State of Jharkhand.\n\nGiven the legal precedent and the application of the relevant sections of law, we find the lower court's judgment to be incorrect. Therefore, we allow the appeal and set aside the impugned order permitting the respondent to withdraw the deposited fine amount during the pendency of the appeal."

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue in this case is whether the lower court was correct in initiating criminal proceedings against the petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, based on the complaint filed by the respondent. The petitioner argues that the lower court erred in taking cognizance without producing registration proof of the chit fund company and records to show that the petitioner is the subscriber of the chit funds. The petitioner also relies on Criminal Petition No.1387 / 2011 disposed of on 06.07.2018 [R. Parimala Bai Vs. Bhaskar Narasimhaiah].\n\nUnder Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the ingredients required to initiate proceedings are: (i) the making of a cheque for payment of money; (ii) the cheque having been presented to the bank within a certain period; (iii) the cheque being returned by the bank unpaid; (iv) the amount of the cheque being unpaid; (v) the making of the cheque without sufficient funds in the account of the maker; (vi) the accused having drawn the cheque knowing that it would be difficult for him to pay the amount of the cheque from his own funds; and (vii) the accused having committed the offence wilfully.\n\nIn the present case, the petitioner admits to issuing the cheques, and the complainant has established that the cheques were dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The petitioner's argument that the complainant failed to produce registration proof of the chit fund company and records to show that the petitioner is the subscriber of the chit funds is not a valid defence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The registration of a chit fund company is irrelevant for the offence of dishonour of cheques under Section 138.\n\nThe lower court's decision to initiate criminal proceedings against the petitioner is correct under the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. Therefore, the appeal should be dismissed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe appellant herein was the defendant against whom the present respondent has instituted a suit in OS No.178/2005 in the Court of Additional Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.), Chikmagalur (henceforth for brevity referred to as \"the trial Court\") for recovery of a sum of Rs. 62,602.29 with interest thereupon The summary of the case of the plaintiff in the Trial Court was that, plaintiff was the coffee trading company dealing with the coffee purchase and sale. The defendant got supplied the fertilizers for Rs. 23,522/- on 15.09.1999 and also availed consignment advance from the plaintiff firm to a tune of Rs. 13,200/- on 05.05.1998, Rs. 86,000/- on 12.05.1998, Rs. 1,50,000/- on 13.05.1998, Rs. 38,460/- on 10.11.1998 and Rs. 2,718/- on 19.05.1999 agreeing and undertaking to supply the coffee grown in his estate.  Thereafter, the defendant supplied the coffee worth Rs. 2,49,200/- on 30.04.1998 and Rs. 44,320 on 19.05.1999 and the same had been adjusted towards the plaintiff company. Thereafter, the defendant had stopped supplying the coffee to the plaintiff company even though he was due to the plaintiff firm. When several demands and requests were made by the company, the defendant issued a cheque bearing No.0528613 dated 30.06.2002 for a sum of Rs. 40,365/- drawn on Karnataka Bank Limited, Chikmagalur Branch. The said cheque returned dishonoured when presented for realization on 08.07.2002 with the shara \"funds insufficient\". Subsequently, inspite of several requests and demands and issuing of legal notice on 19.07.2002, the defendant did not make good the payment. As such, the plaintiff filed a private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 before the Additional Judicial Magistrate-I Class at Chikmanagalur in CC No.396/2004. The said criminal case was pending as on the date of instituting the suit. Thus, the plaintiff was constrained to institute the suit against the defendant for recovery of a sum of Rs. 62,061.29, which was inclusive of interest till the date of filing of the suit by the defendant.  In response to the summons the defendant appeared before the trial Court through his counsel and filed his written statement, wherein he specifically denied the alleged loan transaction said to have taken place between himself and the plaintiff and also he issuing the cheques towards the said transaction. The defendant has contended that during 1998, he had pooled the coffee with the plaintiff company under the consignment basis.  The company had a policy at that time to the effect that, out of the pooled coffee, they used to keep the coffee bags until and unless persons who pooled coffee request to dispose of the same. Till then, the company used to collect the godown charges. Accordingly, this defendant had issued a blank cheque in the year 1998 towards the security of the coffee pooled, but subsequently, when he sold the coffee, transaction between himself and the plaintiff was closed, but, the cheque which was issued by him to the plaintiff remained with the plaintiff company. When enquired for the same, the company stated that it is searching for the same and the same would be handed over to him once it is traced. Defendant specifically contended that he had not been to the plaintiff company in the year 2002 and not issued any cheque for a sum of Rs. 40,365/- dated 30.06.2002. He also stated that the cheque issued in the year 1998 was fabricated, concocted and the plaintiff had filed a false suit. In this regard, he had also issued a suitable reply to the legal notice to the plaintiff. With this, he prayed for dismissal of the suit.  Based upon the pleadings of the parties, the Trial Court framed the following issues and additional issues:  In support of his case, the plaintiff got himself examined as PW-1. He has also got produced and marked the documents from Exs.P1 to P7. Defendant got himself examined as DW-1, and got the documents marked from Exs.D1 to D6. Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree of dismissal passed by the Trial Court, the plaintiff preferred an appeal before the Court of the Principal District Judge at Chikmagalur (henceforth for brevity referred to as \"the First Appellate Court\") under Order XLI Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in R.A.No.17/2010.  The respondent therein appeared before the Court and contested the matter  The First Appellate Court framed the following points for its consideration:\\n\\n1. \"Whether the appellant/plaintiff has made out a case so as to interfere with the judgment and decree of the trial court?\\n\\n2. What order?\" It is against the said judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court, the defendant has preferred this appeal.  In response to the notice, the respondent is being represented by his Counsel. The lower court records were called for and the same are placed before the Court.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel for the appellant / defendant in his argument while reiterating the contention taken up by the appellant in his memorandum of appeal contended that the First Appellate Court has erroneously come to a conclusion that there exists legally enforceable debt against the appellant.  It also totally misunderstood as to the fact and merely because the defendant has admitted that there existed transaction between him and the plaintiff at an earlier point of time, it applied an erroneous logic of presumption against the defendant.  He further submits that the Court below has also ignored the fact that the suit was barred by limitation. When admittedly the transactions between the parties have ended in 1998, the question of the defendant issuing the cheque in the year 2002 does not arise. As such, the suit was fully barred by limitation. Learned counsel further submitted that the criminal case filed by the plaintiff under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in CC No.396/2004 was ended in acquittal on 18.12.2007. Against the same, the plaintiff filed a Criminal Appeal No.421/2008 before this High Court, which also came to be dismissed by the judgment of this Court dated 17.09.2009, holding that the cheque was issued only as a security during 1998 or prior to that. Thus, the plaintiff has utterly failed to prove his case. On the other hand, the defendant apart from taking a contention in his written statement at the earliest to the effect that as a practice prevailing in the said trade, in the said place, at the relevant point of time while pooling coffee with the plaintiff, given them a blank cheque as a security in the year 1998 and the same was misused by the plaintiff by filling it by themselves in the year 2002, has also led his evidence on the similar line and in his support has got produced a copy of the statement of his bank account maintained at the Karnataka Bank Limited, Chikmagaluru.  A perusal of the said bank statement from 5th March 1998 to 13th July 2002, go to show that the cheque leaves are used by the defendant in seriatim through-out the said period in his account. Even the cheque leaves bearing the serial No.528611 up to 528620 are shown to have been debited in his account in seriatim and chronologically. Thus, a doubt arises as to how can an intervening cheque in the said series number and bearing cheque No.0528613 alone was shown to have been issued in the year 2002 when all other cheques in the same series were shown issued and realised between 18.09.1998 to 05.08.1999. However, there is no bar for issuing an in between serial number cheque at a later date. As such, the mere production of the accounts statement at Ex.P3 cannot be a conclusive proof to hold that the cheque at Ex.P1 should have been issued in the year 2002. Still, it leads to a suspicion in the contention of the plaintiff that the said cheque was issued by the defendant only on the date mentioned by him in Ex.P1 ie., on 30.06.2002. On the other hand, the contention of the defendant that the said cheque at Ex.P1 was issued by him to the plaintiff in the year 1998, only as a matter of security, which was misused by the plaintiff, appears to be more nearer to the truth and believable, as such, it has to be held that the transaction as alleged by the plaintiff resulting in outstanding due of a cheque amount in Ex.P1 from the defendant towards the plaintiff has not taken place being a correct finding of fact on records. The First Appellate Court was not justified in reversing the said finding. The second point of contention raised in the case is that the suit was barred by time when it was filed. According to the plaintiff when the cheque was issued in the year 1998, the defendant has written the date as 30.06.2002, by himself by which time the suit was barred. Therefore, initiation of the suit subsequently in the year 2005 was barred by limitation.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n. Learned counsel for the respondent - plaintiff in his argument submitted that an acquittal in a criminal case does not come in the way of Civil Court adjudicating the suit coming before it. He also submitted that the issuance of cheque at Ex.P1 is not disputed by the defendant. Therefore, when the cheque has been issued and the same has amounted to acknowledgment of the liability towards the plaintiff under Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (henceforth for brevity referred to as \"the Contract Act\") it amounts to an agreement to pay time barred debt, as such, within three years from the said date, the suit has been filed. Thus, the suit is within the limitation. In his support he relied upon few judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and other High Courts which will be referred to at the relevant stage hereafterwards.  Learned counsel for the plaintiff / respondent in his argument submitted that when the cheque at Ex.P1 is not disputed that it bears the signature of the defendant, then, legal presumption arises under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in favour of the plaintiff. With respect to the said presumption, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mallavarupu Kasivisweswara Rao Vs. Thadikonda Ramulu Firm reported in AIR 2008 SC 2898, was pleased to observe that, under Section 118(a) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the executant by virtue of Clause (a) of Section 118 the Act, the Court is obliged to presume that the promissory note was made for consideration, until the contrary is proved. Initially burden lies on the defendant to prove non-existence of consideration which would lead the Court to believe the non existence of consideration either by direct evidence or by preponderance of probabilities showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or illegal.  In the same judgment, at Paragraph No.13, it was further observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that, if the defendant is proved to have discharged the initial onus of proof showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or the same was illegal, the onus would be shifted to the plaintiff who would be obliged to prove it as a matter of fact and upon its failure to prove, would dis-entitle him to the grant of relief on the basis of the negotiable instrument. If the defendant fails to discharge the initial onus of proof by showing the non-existence of the consideration, the plaintiff would invariably be held entitled to the benefit of presumption arising under Section 118(a) in his favour. The very case of the plaintiff in his pleading, as well in his evidence of PW1 was that the defendant was approaching it for consignment advance and also for the supply of fertilizers to his estate and thereby, the defendant got supplied the fertilizers worth Rs. 23,522/- on 15.09.1999 and also availed consignment advance from the plaintiff firm to the tune of Rs. 13,200/- on 05.05.1998, Rs. 86,000/- on 12.05.1998, Rs. 1,50,000/- on 13.05.1998, Rs. 38,460/- on 10.11.1998 and Rs. 2,718/- on 19.05.1999 agreeing and undertaking to supply coffee to his estate. According to the plaintiff, thereafter the defendant supplied to it coffee worth Rs. 2,49,200/- on 30.04.1998 and Rs. 44,320/- on 19.05.1949. These figures are reflected in Ex.P6 which is said to be an extract of statement of accounts maintained by the plaintiff. The said transactions have been specifically and categorically denied by the defendant both in his pleadings and as an evidence in his pleading as DW1.  Therefore, merely because the plaintiff has produced a computer extract at Ex.P6 stating to be an account extract, by that itself, it cannot be believed that the contents of the same are true. Admittedly, the plaintiff which is a company and a trader in coffee seeds is expected to maintain books and ledger of accounts. None of those books or ledger of accounts have been produced by it, though the same were in their possession and custody. Had they produced those books of accounts, they could have substantially proved their alleged transactions and the alleged arrears of dues from the defendant to the plaintiff. As such, the plaintiff has withheld the best evidence available to it without producing it before the Court. Per contra, learned counsel for the plaintiff / respondent in his argument canvassed a point that even if the suit claim which was due in 1998 was considered to be barred by limitation in the year 2002, however, by issuance of a cheque on 30.06.2002 by the defendant has resulted in an agreement to pay a time bared debt by the defendant, as such, it comes under Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act,1872. Therefore, the suit instituted in the year 2005 is not barred by limitation. In this regard, learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of Madras High Court in Sri.Kapaleeswarar Temple, Mylapore reported in AIR 1975 Madras 164.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n. The Trial Court after hearing both side and considering the material placed before it, by its judgment and decree dated 04.11.2009 dismissed the suit of the plaintiff. After hearing both side, by its judgment and decree dated 23.01.2013, First Appellate Court allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment and decree passed in O.S.No.178/2005 dated 04.11.2009 by the trial Court and decreed the suit of the plaintiff for a sum of Rs. 62,602.29 with interest at 18% per annum. The Trial Court considering all these aspects has come to a conclusion that presumption under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not available to the plaintiff since the defendant has rebutted the said presumption. The Trial Court has observed that the defendant could able to prove that the cheque at Ex.P1 was issued in blank in the year 1998. However, the plaintiff (respondent herein) had filled the said cheque by themselves in the year 2002 and presented it. The First Appellate Court also in its observations has given a finding that even though the defendant / appellant had given a cheque in the year 1998, by signing the same, then under such circumstances, Section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act authorize a person who holds the instrument to validate the said cheque by filling up the said cheque. Making the said observations, it held that the Trial Court had not properly appreciated the evidence and has come to wrong conclusion.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Heard arguments of learned Counsel from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court.For the sake of convenience, the parties would be referred to with the ranks they were holding before the trial Court respectively.The fact that the plaintiff was a company dealing with buying and selling of coffee seeds and also supplying fertilizers to the producers of coffee seeds and making them advance payment, is not in dispute. Similarly, the fact that the defendant is an agriculturist and he had business transaction with the plaintiff and was selling his coffee seeds through the plaintiff company, is also not in dispute. The defendant himself has admitted in his written statement that he was pooling his coffee grown in his estate and that in the year 1998 also he had pooled coffee with the plaintiff company under the consignment basis. Thus, the mutual acquaintance between the plaintiff and the defendant and their relationship with respect to the production and sale of coffee seeds has remained an admit ed fact. However, the contention of the plaintiff that in 1998 after the debit and credit made in the accounts of the defendant, it was found that the defendant was due to pay certain sum of money towards which, the defendant has issued them a cheque on 30.06.2002 for a sum of Rs. 40,365/-, is in serious dispute. According to the defendant, though the said cheque which was also marked at Ex.P1 by the plaintiff witness (PW1) in his evidence, but the same was issued as a security by the defendant to the plaintiff, which cheque was misused by the plaintiff. Thus, the transaction as alleged by the plaintiff has been seriously disputed by the defendant.On behalf of the plaintiff, one Mr.A.R.Vishwa, who is said to be an authorized signatory of the plaintiff company, got examined as PW1 and his evidence was reiterated by the plaintiff and this witness has reiterated the contentions taken by the plaintiff in his plaint and specifically stated that in order to meet the outstanding liability of the plaintiff, the defendant issued a cheque on 30.06.2002 for a sum of Rs. 40,365/- which was produced and marked at Ex.P1. He has also produced bank endorsement and the reason for return of cheques as \"insufficient funds\" at Ex.P2, a copy of the legal notice said to have been issued from the plaintiff side to the defendant on 19.07.2002 at Ex.P3, returned postal cover and certificate of posting at Exs.P4 and P5 respectively and a certified copy of the statement of accounts at Ex.P6.1. The defendant got himself examined as DW1. He reiterated the contention taken up by him in his written statement. He also got produced a copy of the reply notice sent on 31.07.2002 at Ex.D1, a copy of the judgment in CC No.396/2004 at Ex.D2, a copy of his statement of accounts with Karnataka Bank Limited, Chikmagalur at Ex.D3, an account extract said to have been produced by the plaintiff in the criminal case at Ex.D4, a copy of the legal notice issued to him by the plaintiff at Ex.D5 which is similar to Ex.P3 and a copy of his reply notice at Ex.D6 which is a copy similar to that of Ex.D1. It is not in dispute that the cheque at Ex.P1 is given by the defendant to the plaintiff even though the defendant disputed that filling up of the cheque was by the plaintiff and that he had issued a blank cheque in the year 1998. It is also not in dispute that the said cheque at Ex.P1 was shown to have been drawn for a sum of Rs. 40,365/- in favour of the plaintiff dated 30.06.2002 and the said cheque when presented for honour came to be dishonoured for \"insufficient funds\" as could be seen from Ex.P2. In that regard plaintiff also issued a legal notice on the defendant dated 19.07.2002 as could be seen at Ex.P4.The contention of the defendant that for the said notice, he had issued a reply dated 31.07.2002 as per Exs.D1 and D6 is also not in dispute. Further upon the dishonour of the said cheques, the plaintiff instituted a criminal proceedings under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act against the defendant in CC No.396/2004 before the Additional JMFC at Chikmagaluru and that the said case ended in acquittal by the judgment of the said Court dated 18.12.2007, is also not in dispute. Against the said judgment of acquittal, the plaintiff preferred an appeal before this Court in Crl.A.No.421/2008 which appeal also came to be dismissed by this Court by its judgment dated 17.09.2010, observing that the cheque appears to have been given towards the security to the complainant and by filling up the same, it has been presented. As such, the trial Court has rightly dismissed the complaint is also not in dispute.In the light of the above, it was the first point of argument of learned counsel for the respondent / plaintiff that the finding given in a criminal case by a Criminal Court would not come in the way of adjudication of suit on its own merit by the Civil Court with respect to the same subject matter between the same parties. Following these two judgments, in the instant case also without being carried away by the act of acquittal of the accused / defendant in the criminal case for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the present case has to be decided on its own merit, more particularly, about aspect of issuance of cheque at Ex.P1 by the defendant to the plaintiff and its consequences. A bare reading of the said Section go to show that a person signing a blank cheque, is liable upon such instrument, in the capacity in which he signed the same to any holder in due course for such an amount. However, in such an event though primarily a presumption under Section 118 of the said Act could be drawn, still the said presumption is a rebuttable one. In the instant case, by a finding of both the Courts below when it is taken that it has been shown that the cheque at Ex.P1 was delivered by the defendant to the plaintiff in the year 1998 as a security, still if the defendant can able to show that he was not due of any amount, much less, the one shown in the cheque to the plaintiff, then, the presumption with respect to the consideration under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act would not enure to the benefit of the plaintiff.In the present case, according to the plaintiff, cheque amount also includes quantum of fertilizers supplied on behalf of the plaintiff to the defendant on 15.09.1999. To this effect, the plaintiff, both in his plaint as well in his evidence as PW1, has specifically stated that, at the first instance, the said supply of fertilizer on its behalf to the defendant was by one Mr.K.R.Annegowda and Sons, a fertilizers dealer. However, in his subsequent cross examination, the very same witness has stated that the entry at Ex.P6 dated 15.09.1999 is with respect to one M/s. Lakshmi Fertilizers. The said witness has further stated that the supply of fertilizers to the defendant was by M/s. Lakshmi Fertilizers. The same witness has further admitted a suggestion as true that there is no relationship or nexus between M/s. Lakshmi Fertilizers and M/s. K.R.Annegowda Fertilizers.The said evidence of PW1 as elicited in his cross examination makes it clear that the entry in Ex.P6 is not reliable and more particularly with respect to supply of fertilizers, the amount of which is shown as Rs. 38,460/-. When PW1 himself says at one place the supply of fertilizer was through M/s. Annegowda Fertilizers and also admits that there is no relationship between M/s. K.R.Annegowda Fertilizers and M/s. Lakshmi Fertilizers, then, the outstanding amount shown as fertilizer supplied through M/s. Lakshmi Fertilizers Ex.P6, cannot be believed. Therefore, the correctness of the statement of accounts based upon which the cheque amount is shown to have been mentioned and the suit instituted proves to be erroneous. This is also for the reason that, PW1 in his cross-examination dated 24.09.2008, has specifically admitted a suggestion as true that from the year 1998 onwards, the defendant had no transaction of any type with the plaintiff. If the said statement made by the plaintiff himself is accepted, then the evidence of PW1 that in September 1999, fertilizer was supplied to the defendant through M/s. Lakshmi Fertilizers proves to be false. Secondly the alleged outstanding liability shown in the cheque at Ex.P1 also proves to be false.In view of the above analysis, it is clear that the cheque was issued by the defendant in 1998 in the blank form and except his signature rest of all the contents were filled by the plaintiff in the year 2002 when the cheque was presented, as such, as on that date the suit was barred by limitation. In the said case, Ex.P1 which was a letter shown to have been executed by the respondent on 02.11.1968 was considered as a promise made and signed by the executant acknowledging the time barred debt. In the instant case, as observed above, the defendant had issued only a blank cheque in 1998 itself. By that time, neither the alleged arrears from the defendant was fructified in the accounts of the plaintiff nor the cause of action has arisen from the plaintiff to institute a suit. However, it was after the period of limitation to institute a suit, the plaintiff has filled the said cheque by showing the date in the instrument at Ex.P1 dated 30.06.2002 and presented it for realization and thereafter, has instituted his suit in the year 2005.Therefore, the said cheque at Ex.P1 which is a Bill of Exchange is in the form of an order to a banker by the drawer of the instrument for the money to be paid to the payee or his order, cannot be considered as a promise made in writing and signed by the person to be charged there with to pay wholly or in part the debt of which the plaintiff might have enforced payment to in the law for the institution of the suits.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9bcd\n**Facts**: . The present appellant was the complainant in the Court of learned XXII Addl.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and XXIV Addl.Small Causes Judge, Bengaluru City, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'trial Court'), in C.C.No.64/2007, which case was filed against the present respondent arraigning him as accused, under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'N.I.Act'). The summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court is that the complainant being the dealer in SWR Systems, PVC Agri pipes, Sanitary wares etc., at the request of the accused, who is the Proprietor of one M/s.Subramanya Agencies, had supplied goods to him worth Rs. 3,75,224/- on credit under the credit invoices. After deducting the payment made by the accused, on 2.8.2006 still he was due to the complainant a sum of Rs. 79,566/-. Towards dischargal of a portion of the said outstanding due amount, the accused issued two cheques to the complainant bearing No.450377, dated 2.8.2006, for a sum of Rs. 15,000/- and another cheque bearing No.450378, dated 18.8.2006, for a sum of Rs. 20,000/-, both drawn on Vijaya Bank, Tallur Branch, Udupi District. The complainant presented those cheques on 18.8.2006 through his Banker, however, the said cheques came to be dishonoured for the reason of 'insufficient funds' on 13.10.2006. Thereafter, the complainant got issued a legal notice on 25.10.2006 to the accused through Registered Post Acknowledgement Due, as well under Certificate of Posting. Though the notice was served, the accused neither replied to the said notice nor met the demand made in the notice, which constrained the complainant to institute a criminal case for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. The respondent who was accused in the trial Court appeared and contested the matter. In order to prove their case, the complainant got examined one Sri T.K.Umapathy, who is said to be its Sales Manager and an authorised person to give evidence and through him got marked documents from Exs.P-1 to P-11.  From the accused side, neither any witness was examined nor any documents were marked as exhibits. Being aggrieved by the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.  The respondent/accused is being represented by his learned counsel. Perused the materials placed before this Court.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: After hearing both side, the trial Court by its impugned judgment dated 20.07.2010, acquitted the accused for the alleged offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: It is not in dispute that the complainant which is said to be a Private Limited Company is a dealer in SWR Systems, PVC Agri pipes, Sanitary wares etc., One Sri T.K.Umapathy, who is said to be its authorised signatory was examined as PW-1 for the complainant-Company. The said witness in his Examination-in-chief in the form of Affidavit evidence has reiterated the contentions taken up by him in his complaint. He has also given the details of the credit Bills under which the goods were said to have been supplied to the accused on different dates commencing from 02-11-2004 upto 21-03-2005 in total amounting to a sum of Rs. 3,75,224/-. Apart from stating that the cheques issued by the accused were dishonoured, the witness has produced those cheques at Exs.P-3 and P-4.  He has further clarified that by oversight and typographical error in the complaint, he has mentioned that the cheques were dishonoured for the reason of insufficiency of funds, whereas, the cheques were dishououred as the account of the drawer was closed. The banker's endorsements which are at Exs.P-5 and P-6 also show that the cheques at Exs.P-3 and P-4 presented by the complainant were dishonoured with the banker's endorsement that the drawer's account was closed. PW-1 has also produced a copy of the legal notice at Ex.P-7, postal receipt, Under Certificate of Posting and postal acknowledgement at Exs.P-8, P-9, P-10 respectively. He has also produced the extracts of the Ledger Account at Ex.P-11 to show the alleged outstanding balance which is said to be due from the accused. The witness was subjected to cross examination from the accused' side, wherein the denial suggestions made by the accused were not admitted as true by the witness. In the light of the above, it was the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that the business relationship between the complainant and the accused is not disputed, so also, the issuance of cheques at Exs.P-3 and P-4. The dishonour of the cheques for the reason of closure of the drawer's account is also an admitted fact.  Stating so, the learned counsel submits that despite all these favourable points in his support, which prove his case, still, the Trial Court, relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Krishna Janardhan Bhat Vs. Dattatraya G. Hegde reported in AIR 2008 SUPREME COURT 1325, observing that legally recoverable debt was not proved, acquitted the accused, which is not a correct finding.  He submits that the ruling of the Hon'ble Apex Court about the legal presumption since has been clarified in a subsequent judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court, in the case of Rangappa Vs. Sri. Mohan reported in (2010) 11 SUPREME COURT CASES 441, without any further argument, the Trial Court Judgment deserves to be reversed and the accused deserves to be punished for the alleged offence.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent/accused in his argument submitted that, the accused has denied the transaction with the complainant and has taken a specific contention that blank cheques were misused by the Company to institute a false case against him. He also submits that PW-1 had no authority to give evidence on behalf of the complainant Company.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Heard the arguments of learned counsel from both side  It is not in dispute that the complainant is a Private Limited Company. PW-1 - Sri. T.K. Umapathy, in his evidence has stated that, he is representing the complainant Company for which he has been duly authorised by the Company to represent it in the present case. In support of his said statement, he has produced a Board resolution passed by the complainant Company and got it marked at Ex.P-1. Though this witness was cross-examined on the said point, except eliciting the details of the Directors of the Company, it was not specifically contended that PW-1 had no authority to lead evidence.  On the other hand, the Board resolution which is at Ex.P-1 specifically shows that, the Company in its Board resolution dated 20-10-2006 has authorised inter alia PW-1 - Sri. T.K. Umapathy its Sales Manager to sign the papers pertaining to the case, execute affidavit to adduce evidence, etc. Thus, the said resolution since has authorised PW-1 to represent the Company and to give evidence in the matter, the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent/accused that PW-1 had no authority to represent the Company, is not acceptable.  PW-1 has given in his evidence a detailed account of the supplies made to the accused' establishment wherein the accused is the proprietor from 02-11-2004 upto 21-03-2005 and under 29 credit bills on different dates, the goods are shown to have been supplied to the respondent. The total amount is shown at Rs. 3,75,224/-. Through Ex.P-11 - which is the statement of Ledger Account, the complainant has further shown the details of the goods supplied to the respondent on various dates, the amount received by the complainant towards the supplies made and the outstanding liability.  Except making denial suggestion, the accused has not made any attempt to deny the correctness of the evidence of PW-1 regarding supply made as well as correctness and authenticity of Ex.P-11. Thus, the complainant through his oral and documentary evidence has shown that he has supplied the goods towards which the accused had remained due to him with certain outstanding liability.  Admittedly, the two cheques at Exs.P-3 and P-4 pertain to the account of the accused. No where the accused has denied that he was the drawer of those two instruments, on the contrary, he has taken a defence that the blank cheques have been misused by the Company. Except making that suggestion to PW-1, no where the accused has made any attempt to show as to under what circumstances and how come he could issue those two blank cheques to the complainant. PW-1 has denied the suggestion that the two blank cheques were given to him and the complainant has misused those two cheques. Thus, the issuance of cheques is also convincingly explained by the complainant. The evidence of PW-1 about the presentation of those two cheques for realisation through his bankers and the dishounour of those two cheques by the banker as per its endorsements at Exs.P-5 and P-6 and the issuance of the legal notice at Ex.P-7 have all remained undisputed in the evidence of PW-1. Even though the complainant in its complaint has stated that the reason for dishonour of those two cheques was insufficiency of funds, however, in his evidence, he has given a clarification that both the cheques were dishonoured for the reason of closure of the account of the drawer. However, inadvertently and due to typographical error, in the complaint, the reason was shown as 'insufficiency of funds'. The said explanation given by PW-1 has remained undisputed and it clarifies the alleged minor discrepancy in the complaint of the complainant. The above facts clearly demonstrate that the accused has issued two cheques to the complainant as per Exs.P-3 and P-4 and the same came to be dishonoured as per banker's endorsements at Exs.P-5 and P-6, subsequent to which, within the stipulated time, the complainant has issued statutory notice upon the accused demanding the payment of the cheques' amount, however, the accused did not respond to the same.  The learned Trial Court Judge though has observed all these aspects in his judgment, however, relying upon a decision in the case of Krishna Janardhan Bhat (supra) has held that, the existence of a legally recoverable debt is not a matter of presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. Since the said finding in Krishna Janardhan Bhat's case (supra) was subsequently clarified by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Rangappa's case (supra), holding that the presumption mandated by Section 139 of the N.I. Act includes a presumption that, there exists a legally enforceable debt or liability, however, such presumption is rebuttable in nature.\n",

Your task is to deliver a concise, well-reasoned verdict based on the case details provided. You should carefully analyze whether the ruling by the lower court was correct, taking into account the presented evidence, the arguments from both parties, and the applicable sections of the law.\n\n### **Case Details:**\n1. **Facts and Arguments of the case**: acts:\\nThe appellant herein was the defendant against whom the present respondent has instituted a suit in OS No.178/2005 in the Court of Additional Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.), Chikmagalur (henceforth for brevity referred to as \\\"the trial Court\\\") for recovery of a sum of Rs. 62,602.29 with interest thereupon The summary of the case of the plaintiff in the Trial Court was that, plaintiff was the coffee trading company dealing with the coffee purchase and sale. The defendant got supplied the fertilizers for Rs. 23,522/- on 15.09.1999 and also availed consignment advance from the plaintiff firm to a tune of Rs. 13,200/- on 05.05.1998, Rs. 86,000/- on 12.05.1998, Rs. 1,50,000/- on 13.05.1998, Rs. 38,460/- on 10.11.1998 and Rs. 2,718/- on 19.05.1999 agreeing and undertaking to supply the coffee grown in his estate.  Thereafter, the defendant supplied the coffee worth Rs. 2,49,200/- on 30.04.1998 and Rs. 44,320 on 19.05.1999 and the same had been adjusted towards the plaintiff company. Thereafter, the defendant had stopped supplying the coffee to the plaintiff company even though he was due to the plaintiff firm. When several demands and requests were made by the company, the defendant issued a cheque bearing No.0528613 dated 30.06.2002 for a sum of Rs. 40,365/- drawn on Karnataka Bank Limited, Chikmagalur Branch. The said cheque returned dishonoured when presented for realization on 08.07.2002 with the shara \\\"funds insufficient\\\". Subsequently, inspite of several requests and demands and issuing of legal notice on 19.07.2002, the defendant did not make good the payment. As such, the plaintiff filed a private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 before the Additional Judicial Magistrate-I Class at Chikmanagalur in CC No.396/2004. The said criminal case was pending as on the date of instituting the suit. Thus, the plaintiff was constrained to institute the suit against the defendant for recovery of a sum of Rs. 62,061.29, which was inclusive of interest till the date of filing of the suit by the defendant.  In response to the summons the defendant appeared before the trial Court through his counsel and filed his written statement, wherein he specifically denied the alleged loan transaction said to have taken place between himself and the plaintiff and also he issuing the cheques towards the said transaction. The defendant has contended that during 1998, he had pooled the coffee with the plaintiff company under the consignment basis.  The company had a policy at that time to the effect that, out of the pooled coffee, they used to keep the coffee bags until and unless persons who pooled coffee request to dispose of the same. Till then, the company used to collect the godown charges. Accordingly, this defendant had issued a blank cheque in the year 1998 towards the security of the coffee pooled, but subsequently, when he sold the coffee, transaction between himself and the plaintiff was closed, but, the cheque which was issued by him to the plaintiff remained with the plaintiff company. When enquired for the same, the company stated that it is searching for the same and the same would be handed over to him once it is traced. Defendant specifically contended that he had not been to the plaintiff company in the year 2002 and not issued any cheque for a sum of Rs. 40,365/- dated 30.06.2002. He also stated that the cheque issued in the year 1998 was fabricated, concocted and the plaintiff had filed a false suit. In this regard, he had also issued a suitable reply to the legal notice to the plaintiff. With this, he prayed for dismissal of the suit.  Based upon the pleadings of the parties, the Trial Court framed the following issues and additional issues:  In support of his case, the plaintiff got himself examined as PW-1. He has also got produced and marked the documents from Exs.P1 to P7. Defendant got himself examined as DW-1, and got the documents marked from Exs.D1 to D6. Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree of dismissal passed by the Trial Court, the plaintiff preferred an appeal before the Court of the Principal District Judge at Chikmagalur (henceforth for brevity referred to as \\\"the First Appellate Court\\\") under Order XLI Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in R.A.No.17/2010.  The respondent therein appeared before the Court and contested the matter  The First Appellate Court framed the following points for its consideration:\\\\n\\\\n1. \\\"Whether the appellant/plaintiff has made out a case so as to interfere with the judgment and decree of the trial court?\\\\n\\\\n2. What order?\\\" It is against the said judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court, the defendant has preferred this appeal.  In response to the notice, the respondent is being represented by his Counsel. The lower court records were called for and the same are placed before the Court.\\nArgument by the Petitioner:\\nLearned counsel for the appellant / defendant in his argument while reiterating the contention taken up by the appellant in his memorandum of appeal contended that the First Appellate Court has erroneously come to a conclusion that there exists legally enforceable debt against the appellant.  It also totally misunderstood as to the fact and merely because the defendant has admitted that there existed transaction between him and the plaintiff at an earlier point of time, it applied an erroneous logic of presumption against the defendant.  He further submits that the Court below has also ignored the fact that the suit was barred by limitation. When admittedly the transactions between the parties have ended in 1998, the question of the defendant issuing the cheque in the year 2002 does not arise. As such, the suit was fully barred by limitation. Learned counsel further submitted that the criminal case filed by the plaintiff under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in CC No.396/2004 was ended in acquittal on 18.12.2007. Against the same, the plaintiff filed a Criminal Appeal No.421/2008 before this High Court, which also came to be dismissed by the judgment of this Court dated 17.09.2009, holding that the cheque was issued only as a security during 1998 or prior to that. Thus, the plaintiff has utterly failed to prove his case. On the other hand, the defendant apart from taking a contention in his written statement at the earliest to the effect that as a practice prevailing in the said trade, in the said place, at the relevant point of time while pooling coffee with the plaintiff, given them a blank cheque as a security in the year 1998 and the same was misused by the plaintiff by filling it by themselves in the year 2002, has also led his evidence on the similar line and in his support has got produced a copy of the statement of his bank account maintained at the Karnataka Bank Limited, Chikmagaluru.  A perusal of the said bank statement from 5th March 1998 to 13th July 2002, go to show that the cheque leaves are used by the defendant in seriatim through-out the said period in his account. Even the cheque leaves bearing the serial No.528611 up to 528620 are shown to have been debited in his account in seriatim and chronologically. Thus, a doubt arises as to how can an intervening cheque in the said series number and bearing cheque No.0528613 alone was shown to have been issued in the year 2002 when all other cheques in the same series were shown issued and realised between 18.09.1998 to 05.08.1999. However, there is no bar for issuing an in between serial number cheque at a later date. As such, the mere production of the accounts statement at Ex.P3 cannot be a conclusive proof to hold that the cheque at Ex.P1 should have been issued in the year 2002. Still, it leads to a suspicion in the contention of the plaintiff that the said cheque was issued by the defendant only on the date mentioned by him in Ex.P1 ie., on 30.06.2002. On the other hand, the contention of the defendant that the said cheque at Ex.P1 was issued by him to the plaintiff in the year 1998, only as a matter of security, which was misused by the plaintiff, appears to be more nearer to the truth and believable, as such, it has to be held that the transaction as alleged by the plaintiff resulting in outstanding due of a cheque amount in Ex.P1 from the defendant towards the plaintiff has not taken place being a correct finding of fact on records. The First Appellate Court was not justified in reversing the said finding. The second point of contention raised in the case is that the suit was barred by time when it was filed. According to the plaintiff when the cheque was issued in the year 1998, the defendant has written the date as 30.06.2002, by himself by which time the suit was barred. Therefore, initiation of the suit subsequently in the year 2005 was barred by limitation.\\nArgument by the Respondent:\\n. Learned counsel for the respondent - plaintiff in his argument submitted that an acquittal in a criminal case does not come in the way of Civil Court adjudicating the suit coming before it. He also submitted that the issuance of cheque at Ex.P1 is not disputed by the defendant. Therefore, when the cheque has been issued and the same has amounted to acknowledgment of the liability towards the plaintiff under Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (henceforth for brevity referred to as \\\"the Contract Act\\\") it amounts to an agreement to pay time barred debt, as such, within three years from the said date, the suit has been filed. Thus, the suit is within the limitation. In his support he relied upon few judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and other High Courts which will be referred to at the relevant stage hereafterwards.  Learned counsel for the plaintiff / respondent in his argument submitted that when the cheque at Ex.P1 is not disputed that it bears the signature of the defendant, then, legal presumption arises under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in favour of the plaintiff. With respect to the said presumption, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mallavarupu Kasivisweswara Rao Vs. Thadikonda Ramulu Firm reported in AIR 2008 SC 2898, was pleased to observe that, under Section 118(a) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the executant by virtue of Clause (a) of Section 118 the Act, the Court is obliged to presume that the promissory note was made for consideration, until the contrary is proved. Initially burden lies on the defendant to prove non-existence of consideration which would lead the Court to believe the non existence of consideration either by direct evidence or by preponderance of probabilities showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or illegal.  In the same judgment, at Paragraph No.13, it was further observed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that, if the defendant is proved to have discharged the initial onus of proof showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or the same was illegal, the onus would be shifted to the plaintiff who would be obliged to prove it as a matter of fact and upon its failure to prove, would dis-entitle him to the grant of relief on the basis of the negotiable instrument. If the defendant fails to discharge the initial onus of proof by showing the non-existence of the consideration, the plaintiff would invariably be held entitled to the benefit of presumption arising under Section 118(a) in his favour. The very case of the plaintiff in his pleading, as well in his evidence of PW1 was that the defendant was approaching it for consignment advance and also for the supply of fertilizers to his estate and thereby, the defendant got supplied the fertilizers worth Rs. 23,522/- on 15.09.1999 and also availed consignment advance from the plaintiff firm to the tune of Rs. 13,200/- on 05.05.1998, Rs. 86,000/- on 12.05.1998, Rs. 1,50,000/- on 13.05.1998, Rs. 38,460/- on 10.11.1998 and Rs. 2,718/- on 19.05.1999 agreeing and undertaking to supply coffee to his estate. According to the plaintiff, thereafter the defendant supplied to it coffee worth Rs. 2,49,200/- on 30.04.1998 and Rs. 44,320/- on 19.05.1949. These figures are reflected in Ex.P6 which is said to be an extract of statement of accounts maintained by the plaintiff. The said transactions have been specifically and categorically denied by the defendant both in his pleadings and as an evidence in his pleading as DW1.  Therefore, merely because the plaintiff has produced a computer extract at Ex.P6 stating to be an account extract, by that itself, it cannot be believed that the contents of the same are true. Admittedly, the plaintiff which is a company and a trader in coffee seeds is expected to maintain books and ledger of accounts. None of those books or ledger of accounts have been produced by it, though the same were in their possession and custody. Had they produced those books of accounts, they could have substantially proved their alleged transactions and the alleged arrears of dues from the defendant to the plaintiff. As such, the plaintiff has withheld the best evidence available to it without producing it before the Court. Per contra, learned counsel for the plaintiff / respondent in his argument canvassed a point that even if the suit claim which was due in 1998 was considered to be barred by limitation in the year 2002, however, by issuance of a cheque on 30.06.2002 by the defendant has resulted in an agreement to pay a time bared debt by the defendant, as such, it comes under Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act,1872. Therefore, the suit instituted in the year 2005 is not barred by limitation. In this regard, learned counsel also relied upon the judgment of Madras High Court in Sri.Kapaleeswarar Temple, Mylapore reported in AIR 1975 Madras 164.\\nRuling by the Lower Court:\\n. The Trial Court after hearing both side and considering the material placed before it, by its judgment and decree dated 04.11.2009 dismissed the suit of the plaintiff. After hearing both side, by its judgment and decree dated 23.01.2013, First Appellate Court allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment and decree passed in O.S.No.178/2005 dated 04.11.2009 by the trial Court and decreed the suit of the plaintiff for a sum of Rs. 62,602.29 with interest at 18% per annum. The Trial Court considering all these aspects has come to a conclusion that presumption under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not available to the plaintiff since the defendant has clearly denied the existence of consideration. On the other hand, the defendant has led evidence to show that the cheque at Ex.P1 was issued by him in the year 1998 only as a matter of security during the time of pooling of coffee and the same was misused by the plaintiff. In the absence of presumption under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the plaintiff has failed to prove his case. Therefore, the suit of the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed. First Appellate Court after referring to the case law on the point considered that the presumption under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is rebuttable and the plaintiff has failed to discharge the initial onus of proof. Therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to the benefit of presumption under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The defendant has failed to discharge the initial onus of proof showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or illegal. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of presumption under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. In the absence of any evidence led by the defendant to show that the cheque at Ex.P1 was issued by him in the year 1998 only as a matter of security during the time of pooling of coffee and the same was misused by the plaintiff, the First Appellate Court has come to a conclusion that the defendant is liable to pay the amount of cheque at Ex.P1. In the absence of any evidence led by the defendant to show that the cheque at Ex.P1 was issued by him in the year 1998 only as a matter of security during the time of pooling of coffee and the same was misused by the plaintiff, the First Appellate Court has come to a conclusion that the defendant is liable to pay the amount of cheque at Ex.P1. In the absence of any evidence led by the defendant to show that the cheque at Ex.P1 was issued by him in the year 1998 only as a matter of security during the time of pooling of coffee and the same was misused by the plaintiff, the First Appellate Court has come to a conclusion that the defendant is liable to pay the amount of cheque at Ex.P1. Therefore, the suit of the plaintiff is liable to be decreed. After going through the judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court, this Court is of the view that the First Appellate Court has committed a legal error in reversing the finding of fact recorded by the Trial Court. It is well settled principle of law that an Appellate Court while hearing an appeal against the decree of a suit is not expected to re-appreciate the evidence on record and come to a conclusion of its own. An Appellate Court is expected to interfere with the findings of fact recorded by the Trial Court only in exceptional circumstances and when the findings of fact recorded are patently illegal or against the weight of evidence on record.  In the instant case, the Trial Court after hearing both side and considering the material placed before it, has come to a conclusion that the presumption under Section 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not available to the plaintiff since the defendant has clearly denied the existence of consideration. On the other hand, the defendant has led evidence to show that the cheque at Ex.P1 was issued by him in the year 1998 only as a matter of security during the time of pooling of coffee and the same was misused by the plaintiff. In the absence of presumption under Section 118 of the Negotiable InstrUMENTS Act, the plaintiff has failed to prove his case. Therefore, the suit of the plaintiff is liable to be dismissed. The First Appellate Court after referring to the case law on the point considered that the presumption under Section 118 of the Negotiable INSTRUMENTS Act is rebuttable and the plaintiff has failed to discharge the initial onus of proof. Therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to the benefit of presumption under Section 118 of the NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS Act. The defendant has failed to discharge the initial onus of proof showing that the existence of consideration was improbable or doubtful or illegal. Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of presumption under Section 118 of the NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS Act. In the absence of any evidence led by the defendant to show that the cheque at Ex.P1 was issued by him in the year 1998 only as a matter of security during the time of pooling of coffee and the same was misused by the plaintiff, the First Appellate Court has come to a conclusion that the defendant is liable to pay the amount of cheque at Ex.P1.

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe present 1st respondent had instituted a suit against the present appellant and the present 2nd respondent, arraying them as defendant Nos.1 and 2 respectively, in the Court of the Civil Judge (Sr.Dn.) & JMFC, Belur, (henceforth for brevity referred to as \"the trial Court\"), in O.S.No.24/2008, for recovery of a sum of Rs. 3,17,500/- with interest thereupon at the rate of 18% p.a. The summary of the case of the plaintiff in the trial Court was that, he was a coffee grower and the 1st defendant was a Trading Company, situated at Hassan. The 2nd defendant was the agent of 1st defendant. The 1st defendant was doing the business of purchasing coffee on the basis of consignment through agents.  The 1st defendant had purchased 100 bags of Arabica parchment and 100 bags of Arabica cherry coffee seeds on 16.2.2000 on the basis of consignment kept in the 1st defendant Company under Invoice No.2260 through the 2nd defendant and issued a receipt in favour of the plaintiff. As per the terms, the 1st defendant sold the coffee at the prevailing market rate on the date of sale, towards which, it was liable to pay a sum of Rs. 3,17,500/- to the plaintiff. Since the said amount was not paid despite several requests and demands made by the plaintiff, ultimately the plaintiff got issued a legal notice dated 24.5.2002 to the defendant.  An untenable reply was sent to the plaintiff by the defendant contending that the coffee was purchased from one Sri G.S.Sheshegowda, who has taken away the sale cost of the coffee. The 1st defendant denied the transaction with the plaintiff, which constrained the plaintiff to institute a suit.  In response to the summons served upon them, the defendants appeared through their counsel and filed their written statements. 1st defendant in his written statement denied the alleged transaction said to have been made by it with the plaintiff and also denied the plaint averments. Though it admitted that it received and sold 200 bags of coffee seeds, but, it stated that the said supplier of coffee seeds for sale was one Sri G.S.Sheshegowda, but, not G.M.Sheshegowda.  It also contended that said sale was got done through its authorized agent Sri B.N.Thammannagowda, but, not through M.N.Thammannagowda. It also contended that the consignment receipt No.2260 was drawn in the name of Sri G.S.Sheshegowda. It further contended that considering the request of the Planter, it advanced Rs. 2 lakhs after verifying the required documents, through cheque. The said Planter G.S.Sheshegowda apart from receiving the said amount, also requested and obtained further advance of Rs. 1 lakh from it. 1st defendant also contended that said G.S.Sheshegowda again approached on 9.7.2001 and at his request, the coffee supplied by him was sold and appropriated the sale proceeds to the dues payable by the said supplier. It specifically contended that the plaintiff was a stranger to the entire transaction and unconnected with the transaction of G.S.Sheshegowda with it.  The 2nd defendant in his written statement stated that he is B.N.Thammannagowda, but not M.N.Thammannagowda and that he is neither necessary nor a proper party to the suit. He stated that he has not received any coffee seeds from the plaintiff and the averments made in the plaint are not within his personal knowledge. He also contended that plaintiff was stranger to him and that he never requested for sale of his coffee to 1st defendant through him. He denied all the plaint averments, except admitting that he had worked as an agent of the 1st defendant and was carrying on business in procurement of coffee on commission basis with the 1st defendant. He contended that plaintiff was totally stranger to him. However, he stated that he has procured 200 bags of coffee seeds from one Sri G.S.Sheshegowda on 15.2.2000 for the 1st defendant and the consignment money was received by said G.S.Sheshegowda from time to time through cheques. He also stated that he was personally present when the coffee was kept in consignment by Sri G.S.Sheshegowda, so also, when G.S.Sheshegowda encashed the cheques given by the 1st defendant. With these, he prayed for dismissal of the suit. In support of his case, the plaintiff got himself examined as PW-1 and got examined one more witnesses as PW-2. He has also got produced and marked the documents from Exs.P-1 to P-5. On behalf of the defendants, two witnesses were examined as DW-1 and DW-2 and the documents from Exs.D-1 to D-13 were got marked.  Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court, the 1st defendant preferred an appeal before the Court of the Addl.District Judge, at Hassan, (henceforth for brevity referred to as \"the First Appellate Court\") under Order XLI Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, in R.A.No.12/2010. The respondents therein appeared before the Court and contested the matter.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n. Learned counsel for the appellant/1st defendant in his argument while reiterating the contention taken up by the appellant in its memorandum of appeal, contended that in Ex.P-1 relied upon by the plaintiff to show that he had supplied 200 bags of coffee seeds to the appellant, admittedly there is an alteration and overwriting of an initial in the name of the alleged supplier. The initial is altered from existing 'S' to 'M', which is not authenticated by the author of the said document. Further, the cheques issued to the supplier of the coffee seeds which are at Exs.C-1 and C-2, are also in the name of G.S.Sheshegowda, but not in the name of G.M.Sheshegowda, the plaintiff. Learned counsel further submitted that the documents at Exs.D-1 to D-4 and D-8 to D-13, which are all the documents pertaining to the transaction, stands in the name of G.S.Sheshegowda as the supplier of the coffee, but not in the alleged plaintiff's name of G.M.Sheshegowda.  Learned counsel further submitted that even defendant No.2, who was examined as DW-2, also has supported the case of the defendant, who categorically stated that plaintiff was stranger to the entire alleged transaction. His evidence was not given due weightage by the lower Courts. With this, learned counsel submitted that the plaintiff has basically failed to prove that he had supplied 200 bags of coffee to the 1st defendant as contended in his plaint, as such, the case of the plaintiff could not stand, it was one Sri G.S.Sheshegowda who had supplied the coffee seeds. Securing the consignment receipt standing in the name of said G.S.Sheshegowda, the present plaintiff by tampering the said document, has instituted a false suit, which deserves to be dismissed.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n Learned counsel for the 1st respondent/plaintiff in his argument submitted that Ex.P-1 is the document produced by the plaintiff to show his supply of 200 bags of coffee seeds to the 1st defendant-Company. The said correction in the initials of the supplier of the coffee seeds has been carried out by one of the staff of the company which has been brought out in the evidence of PW-1.  The said evidence giving the explanation for the alleged correction, has not been denied or repudiated from the plaintiff's side, as such, it binds them and establishes that the plaintiff had supplied coffee seeds as averred in his plaint. He further contended that all the documents in Ex.D series are made by the defendant to serve its purpose falsely in the name of Sri G.S.Sheshegowda. He further submitted that despite name of the 2nd defendant is shown as M.N. Thammannagowda even in the documents produced by none else than the 1st defendant, still said M.N.Thammannagowda has deposed that he is not M.N. Thammannagowda, but, he is B.N. Thammannagowda, which conduct of the said witness of having suppressed his alleged true identity throughout, makes his evidence not trustworthy and reliable. Learned counsel further submitted that in Ex.D-3, which is the document produced and relied upon by the 1st defendant-Company, the maximum percentage of the advance that the Company could pay before the sale of the coffee would be only 25%, whereas, according to the 1st defendant, it has paid Rs. 3 lakhs, which, according to them, was 100% of the alleged sale value. Therefore, the act of the 1st defendant gives rise to a suspicion.  That in order to knock off the coffee supplied by the plaintiff, they have created several documents. Learned counsel also submitted that non-examination of Rajesh, their employee, who carried alternation in Ex.P-1 as alleged G.S.Sheshegowda, who is said to be the true supplier of coffee to defendant No.1, makes the case of the defendant fall on the ground. He also submitted that cheques at Exs.C-1 and C-2 also raises several doubts, since neither of them bear the signature of G.S.Sheshegowda, the alleged supplier of coffee seeds, whereas, issuing a bearer cheques for a large amount and authorizing the signatures of stranger for its encashment, the 1st defendant has given scope for further disbelieving its case. As such, the appeal deserves to be dismissed.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n The trial Court after hearing both side and considering the material placed before it, answered issue Nos.1 and 3 in the affirmative and issue No.2 in the negative and by its judgment and decree dated 6.10.2009, the suit of the plaintiff was decreed for a sum of Rs. 3,17,500/-, with interest at the rate of 18% p.a. from the date of suit till the date of payment.\n",
    "Case_Result": "After hearing both side, the First Appellate Court answered point Nos.1 to 3 in the affirmative and point No.4 in the negative and by its judgment and decree dated 28.6.2013, it dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court. It is against the said judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court, the 1st defendant has preferred this appeal. In response to the notice, the respondents are being represented by their Counsel.\n\n13. The lower Court records were called for and the same are placed before the Court.14. Heard arguments of learned Counsel from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be referred to henceforth with the ranks they were holding before the trial Court respectively.The entire case of the parties revolve around the document at Ex.P-1, along with alteration carried out in it in the name of the consigner from G.S.Sheshegowda to G.M.Sheshegowda. If it could be established by the plaintiff that he being the G.M.Sheshegowda, himself had supplied 200 bags of coffee seeds to the defendant No.1, however, said defendant while issuing the consignment receipt at Ex.P-1, has mentioned a wrong initial in his name as 'S' instead of 'M', thus, making it G.S.Sheshegowda, then the appeal fails.According to plaintiff, he is a Planter, growing coffee, which has not been disputed from the defendants. According to him, he had supplied 200 bags of coffee seeds to the 1st defendant through its collecting agent - the 2nd defendant, on 16.2.2000. As an acknowledgement of the same, the 1st defendant-Company had issued a consignment receipt bearing No.2260, which is marked at Ex.P-1. The 1st defendant apart from contending that the plaintiff was totally a stranger to the alleged supply of coffee seeds, had also produced documents at Exs.D-1 to D-13 to show that the true supplier of those coffee seeds was one Sri G.S.Sheshegowda, but, not the plaintiff with the name Sri G.M.Sheshegowda.Among those exhibits produced and marked by the 1st defendant, Ex.D-1 is also a consignment receipt which is exactly the another copy of Ex.P-1, but the initials in the name of Sheshegowda showing as 'G.S.' instead of 'G.M.' in its original printed version. All other documents like sale consignment, advance, weighment sheet, requisition letter, copy of provisional receipt, advance request, cheques, payment voucher, requisition to sell coffee and the consignment receipt, which are at Exs.D-2, D-3, D-4 and D-7 to D-13, shows the name of the supplier as G.S.Sheshegowda of Gendehalli, but, not G.M.Sheshegowda of Gendehalli. It is on the strength of these documents, DW-1 in his evidence has reiterated his written statement averments that the plaintiff is a stranger to the contract and the true consignee is G.S.Sheshegowda, but, not G.M.Sheshegowda. Admittedly, the signatures found in Exs.D-8, D-9, D-10, D-11 and D-12, which according to the 1st defendant, are the signatures of said G.S.Sheshegowda, differ from the signature of the plaintiff. The plaintiff as PW-1 also has stated in his evidence that in the process of transaction, the 1st defendant Company has done lot of paper works. It is based upon the said statement of the plaintiff, the 1st defendant is contending that the plaintiff could not able to produce any of the documents with respect to the supply and sale of coffee seeds to the 1st defendant-Company, except Ex.P-1, which also shows that the plaintiff was not the supplier of coffee seeds to it.. The document at Ex.P-1 and Ex.D-1, except the change in the initial of the consigner, are identical in all other respect. It shows that on 16.2.2000, under Invoice No.2260, through agent Thammannagowda M.N., with Agent Code T-40, the Planter has supplied 200 bags of coffee seeds to the 1st defendant-Company. The said document no where finds the signature of the alleged supplier of the goods. The only difference in these two documents at Ex.P-1 and Ex.D-1 is that even though the name of the supplier is shown as Sheshegowda of Geddehalli, but the initials in the name of the supplier is shown as 'G.S.' in Ex.D-1, whereas, it is shown as 'G.M.' in Ex.P-1. The said 'M' is clearly an overwriting upon 'S' with blue ink. It is solely on the said basis, the defendant is contending that the supplier was one Sri G.S.Sheshegowda, whereas, the plaintiff is G.M. Sheshegowda, who has tampered the said document at Ex.D-1 by changing the initials and bringing it to his name as G.M.Sheshegowda and produced it as Ex.P-1. However, the contention of the plaintiff is that Ex.P-1 is in the original form as it was delivered to him by the 1st defendant.With respect to the correction in the initials of the name in Ex.P-1 is concerned, the 1st defendant on its own has elicited the details in the cross-examination of PW-1 by putting questions to him, for which, PW-1/the plaintiff, has answered, stating that the said correction in the initials at Ex.P-1 was made by one Sri Rajesh, working in the office of the 1st defendant-Company, who has issued the said document to him. PW-1 has also stated that the said Rajesh also told him that the initials are wrongly shown in Ex.P-1 and therefore, he has corrected it. Further, he also told him that he would get Ex.D-1 also corrected in the office.The said evidence of PW-1 that Rajesh was an employee with the 1st defendant Company and that not only he issued Ex.P-1 to the plaintiff acknowledging him as the supplier of the goods, but, also he stated that there was mistake in the initials in the document, as such, he has corrected it and that he would carry out the similar correction in Ex.D-1 also, the said evidence of the witness has not been denied by the defendant. Though it was not necessary for the defendant-Company to elicit those details from the plaintiff/PW-1, it has taken a risk upon its shoulder by eliciting those details from PW-1 on its own. Further without denying the statement made by PW-1 in that regard, the 1st defendant-Company has left open the said clarification given by PW-1 unquestioned. That being the case and also in view of the fact that undisputedly the said document at Ex.P-1 being the only document which would be issued by the 1st defendant Company acknowledging the receipt of coffee seeds for sale, no further document can be expected from the custody or possession of PW-1 and with respect to his wrong mentioning of initials in Ex.P-1 also, the explanation given by PW-1 can be accepted.At this juncture, it also cannot be ignored of the fact that the said Rajesh was not examined by the defendants. When it is the specific case of the plaintiff that the correction in the initials made at Ex.P-1 was by Rajesh who is said to be an employee of defendant No.1 and the evidence of PW-1 to that effect has not been denied or disputed by the defendants, then the onus has shifted on the shoulder of the defendants to rebut the said contention and to show that the evidence of PW-1 in that regard was not trustworthy. In order to do that, it was incumbent upon the defendants, more particularly, the defendant No.1, to examine said Rajesh and to elicit from him the details about the alleged correction in the initials at Ex.P-1. This the defendant No.1 has not discharged. Moreover, even DW-1 also no where in his evidence has stated that Rajesh was an unknown person to them and that no such alleged correction/alteration was made by said Rajesh. By the time DW-1 entered the witness box and marked documents in Ex.D series, Ex.P-1 was also on record as a marked document. Therefore, it was rather more necessary to defendant No.1 to rebut the said evidence of PW-1, which DW-1 failed to do.It is also the case of the appellant that in order to show that the coffee seeds were supplied by him, the plaintiff should have produced any other documents. The said argument of learned counsel is not acceptable for the reason that, undisputedly the plaintiff being a farmer and grower of coffee seeds, what other documents he can possess, except Ex.P-1, to show his alleged supply of coffee seeds to the defendant No.1, is not made known by the learned counsel for the defendant in his argument. Even though PW-1 has stated that documentation was made when he supplied coffee seeds to the defendant No.1, but the same cannot be understood as to whether the copies of those documents were provided or supplied to the plaintiff also. All the documents at Exs.D-2 to D-13 would go to show that those are the documents that were retained by defendant No.1 as a purchasing Company of the coffee seeds. Further, many of those documents are in a standard formats with blanks, which after duly filled, are shown to have been signed by the other party. Therefore, it is the defendant No.1-Company, as an established Company, has prepared documentation for its business purposes, as such, it is the 1st defendant which can produce the documents to show the correctness of the transaction rather than the plaintiff.The defendant No.1 got examined in its favour in the trial Court one Sri B.N.Thammannagowda as DW-2. The said witness no doubt has supported the case of the 1st defendant-Company stating that the plaintiff Sri G.M.Sheshegowda was a stranger to him and that he has not sold any coffee of G.M.Sheshegowda, but, he has sold 200 bags of coffee consigned by one Sri G.S.Sheshegowda. It is also interesting to note that in all the documents produced by the 1st defendant-Company, the name of its agent with Agent Code T-40, is shown as one Sri M.N.Thammannagowda, whereas, DW-2 is not M.N.Thammannagowda, but, he is B.N. Thammannagowda. It is the 1st defendant-Company itself which has tendered the witness of said B.N.Thammannagowda, whom it has shown as M.N.Thammannagowda in its documents. Therefore, such mistakes being committed by the 1st defendant-Company in the initials of the parties transacting with it is clear and evident. As such, there is all the reason to believe that even in the case of the plaintiff also, his initials in the name that the 1st defendant-Company must have wrongly spelt as 'G.S.' instead of 'G.M.'The plaintiff in his support also got examined one Sri.G.S.Sheshegowda of Gendehalli village, as PW-2. The said witness though has stated that he is a Planter at Gendehalli village, having 5 acres of coffee plantation, but, specifically stated that he has not sold or consigned any coffee to the 1st defendant-company on 16.2.2000 and not received a sum of Rs. 3 lakhs from the said company in the form of cheques. On the other hand, in the cross-examination of the very same witness, it has been brought out from the defendants side that this witness was present when the plaintiff consigned his goods with the 1st defendant-Company. Thus, the plaintiff, apart from stating that he is the one who consigned coffee with the 1st defendant-Company, also got produced and examined one Sri G.S.Sheshegowda of his village and demonstrated that said G.S.Sheshegowda was not the consigner of coffee.When the plaintiff has produced all possible evidences and proof to demonstrate that he was the one who had supplied coffee to defendant No.1-Company, then, onus had shifted to the 1st defendant-Company to prove that the consigner of coffee to it was not the plaintiff, but, a different person. In that regard, it should have necessarily summoned and examined said G.S.Sheshegowda, who, according to it, a different person than the plaintiff and the true consigner of coffee. If according to the 1st defendant-Company, it was neither the plaintiff nor PW-2 who were the consigner under the name of G.S.Sheshegowda, then, it was incumbent upon it to summon and examine the alleged true G.S.Sheshegowda and to establish its case. Admittedly, no effort in this direction was made by the 1st defendant.As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondent, Ex.D-3 which is the document of the 1st respondent-Company shown as a requisition by a consigner to keep their stock with the 1st defendant-Company, is with certain terms and conditions. At Sl.No.24, one of the terms of consignment is that 1st defendant -Company cannot grant advance amount beyond 25% of the coffee at the rate prevailing on the date of seeking advance. That means, even according to the 1st defendant-Company, the release of the sale value of the coffee in its entirety would be only upon its completed sale, but, not at a mere consignment of the coffee, whereas, in the case on hand, according to defendant No.1, the sale request was made to it through Ex.D-12 only on 9.7.2001. However, the sale consideration was alleged to have been paid to G.S.Sheshegowda through two cheques drawn on Karnataka Bank, wherein, one cheque for a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs, is dated 24.3.2000 and another cheque for a sum of Rs. 1 lakh is dated 19.5.2000. Thus, much prior to the alleged sale request and the sale of the consigned coffee, the entire sale proceed was said to have released in favour of the consigner which is against the defendant No.1-Company's terms and conditions. This also gives rise to a suspicion in the contention taken up by defendant No.1 regarding the identity of the consigner.One Sri Raghavendra, Assistant Manager of Karnataka Bank, Hassan Branch, was summoned as a Court witness and was examined as CW-1 in the trial Court. The said witness stated that two cheques issued by the 1st defendant-Company in the name of Sri G.S.Sheshegowda were honoured by his Bank and produced those two cheques at Exs.C-1 and C-2. According to the 1st defendant-Company, it was through these two cheques, the payments were said to have been made to Sri G.S.Sheshegowda, who said to be the true consigner. A perusal of those two cheques goes to show that both the cheques are bearer cheques, drawn in the name of G.S.Sheshegowda. It is not known as to how come such cheques for huge amount was issued as a bearer cheques instead of 'Order' or 'Account payee cheque'.Secondly, on the reverse side of both the cheques, the person who got the cheques encashed has been identified by none else than the account holder i.e., defendant No.1-Company after clearly writing as 'signature attested' and the 1st defendant-Company/account holder, had put its rubber stamp and signature. Thus, it had attested the signatures of the person who encashed those two cheques. For the first cheque, the signature attested is of one Sri G.M.Sheshegowda. If according to the 1st defendant, the consigner of the coffee was one Sri G.S.Sheshegwoda, it is not known as to how come it attested the signature of one Sri G.M.Sheshegowda and enabled him to withdraw huge amount of Rs. 2 lakhs. Interestingly, even the said signature of G.M.Sheshegowda on the reverse side of the cheque at Ex.C-1 also is not of the present plaintiff, since his signature totally differs from the one found on the reverse side of Ex.C-1. Similarly, the signature of alleged G.S.Sheshegowda in all the documents produced by defendant No.1-Company in its Ex.D series also does not tally with the signature of G.M.Sheshegowda, the plaintiff.Thirdly, the said cheque at Ex.C-1 on its reverse side, apart from the signature of G.M.Sheshegowda, also bears a signature of one more person whose signature is also found in the alleged requisition form at Ex.D-3 below the place meant for signing by the Planter. Even according to defendant No.1, Ex.D-3 is not signed by the planter and the signature found in Ex.D-3 is also not of G.S.Sheshegowda. Therefore, it was for defendant No.1-Company to identify and to examine as to who that person who has signed both in Ex.D-3 and on the reverse of the cheque at Ex.C-1 on the side of rubber stampand signature of the 1st defendant-Company. This creates a doubt that the said signature must also be of one of the person belonging to the 1st defendant-Company and he also has joined his hands in depicting that payment has been made through Ex.C-1.In Ex.C-2 also, on the reverse of the cheque, signature of one Sri Prakash has been attested by the 1st defendant-Company, with its rubber stamp and signature. According to the Banker, the said cheque amount of Rs. 1 lakh was paid to said Sri Prakash. Why did the defendant No.1-Company endorsed and attested the signature of said Prakash when it was not required to do it under Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, is not answered by the 1st defendant-Company. Admittedly, both the cheques at Exs.C-1 and C-2 were bearer cheques, requiring no attestation or signature by the drawer of the instrument. On the contrary, both the cheques have been attested by the drawer i.e., defendant No.1-Company enabling some person to withdraw the amount therein. Therefore, the contention of the appellant/1st defendant that the plaintiff was not the consigner of the coffee, but, the true consignee G.S.Sheshegowda has already been paid the entire sale proceeds, is not acceptable. On the other hand, as observed above, the plaintiff has proved that it was himself who was the true consigner of the coffee and that he was not paid for the said consignment by the 1st defendant-Company.n the instant case, the finding of both the Courts below being with sound reasoning on appreciation of evidence led before it, I do not find any reason to interfere in it. As such, the said judgment would not enure to the benefit of the appellant.In the instant case, though PW-1 in his cross-examination has admitted that there is an alteration in Ex.P-1 in the initials of the consigner, but, he has given the details as to who carried out such an alteration and under what circumstance. The said explanation given by PW-1 stating that the said alternation was done by none else than one Sri Rajesh of the 1st defendant-Company, who has issued the said Ex.P-1 to him and that he also stated that he would carry out the similar correction in his office copy and documents, has not been denied by the 1st defendant. The said alteration has been considered as an alteration done by the staff of the 1st defendant-Company, as such, the statement of PW-1 cannot be considered as a mere admission of an alteration and cannot be taken as an unilateral alteration. As such, the said judgment relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant would not enure to his benefit.Thirdly, the learned counsel for the appellant contending that the First Appellate Court though was required to pass a reasoned order, has not done the same, has relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in U.Manjunath Rao -vs- U.Chandrashekar and another, reported in (2017) 15 SCC 309. In the said case, the Hon'ble Apex Court has pleased to observe that in a letters patent appeal, the appellant could raise issues pertaining to facts and appreciation of evidence. That is indicative of the fact that the First Appellate Court has a defined role and its judgment should show application of mind and reflect the reasons on the basis of which it agrees with the trial Court. Appeal dismissed",

The petitioner herein is a original complainant who filed a complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, on 21-5-1997. The case of the complainant is that he and accused both were running a business as share brokers. The complainant had a terminal of the National Stock Exchange. The respondent approached the complainant for some transaction to be done with the help of the terminal. The parties agreed for the said transaction and in furtherance of the same, the respondent was to pay an amount of Rs. 35,191/- to the petitioner. Out of the said amount, an amount of Rs. 12,034/- was paid by cheque No. 230143 dated 10-4-1997.  The cheque was deposited in the Bank. The same was dishonoured for want of sufficient funds. On the request of the accused, the cheque was deposited again on 12-4-1997 which was again dishonoured for insufficient funds in the account of the accused. In spite of repeated requests, the amount was not paid by the accused and, therefore, on 24-4-1997, the petitioner, by issuing a notice, called upon the respondent to pay the amount. The respondent failed to comply as per the notice and therefore, the complaint was filed.  The trial Court issued process under section 138 of the said Act. The respondent appeared in the matter, charge was framed against him and evidence was led in furtherance of the charge. The complainant examined himself and two other witnesses and closed his evidence. The original accused did not examine himself nor any other witness on his behalf.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: . The trial Court by the judgment and order dated 30-9-2002, convicted and sentenced the respondent to pay a fine of Rs. 5000/- only.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  The learned Counsel Shri Warma, appearing for the petitioner submits that after going through the evidence on record, the trial Court was convinced and therefore, the order of conviction was recorded against the respondent. But, while awarding sentence, a meager sentence of fine was directed to be imposed on the respondent. Taking into consideration the facts of the case and the evidence led by the petitioner, the sentence was grossly inadequate as imposed by the trial Court and is not in keeping with the principles enunciated by the Apex Court in a reported judgment in the case of Suganthi Suresh Kumar vs. Jagadeeshan, 2002 Cri.L.J. 1003 2002 ILO SC 36.  He further submitted that it would have been appropriate for the trial Court to even award amount of compensation to the petitioner but the same was not done.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  The learned Counsel Shri Wani, appearing for the respondent submits that the amount involved in the case is not hefty one. The principles evolved by the Supreme Court in the case of Suganthi 2002 ILO SC 36 (supra), are not applicable to the facts of the present case and taking into consideration the evidence on record, the trial Court adopted a correct approach in awarding the sentence of fine only instead of awarding punishment of imprisonment.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: The reasoning adopted by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class (IInd Court), Jalgaon for awarding the sentence finds place in the paragraph 28 of the judgment wherein it is observed that the accused prayed for a lenient view and the lesser sentence and taking into consideration the amount involved, the view was adopted that sentence of fine would meet the ends of justice. The respondent failed to satisfy this Court that during pendency of the case, he had shown desire to pay the amount of cheque to the petitioner. He permitted the trial to go ahead till its conclusion and suffer a conviction and sentence. Even, after suffering the order of conviction and sentence, there is nothing on record to show that he had offered to pay the amount to the petitioner. The grievance of the learned Counsel for the petitioner is that this is a fit case wherein there could have been substantial sentence and also an order awarding compensation to the petitioner. There is substance in the said argument.  For the offence punishable under section 138 of the said Act, law provides punishment with imprisonment for a term which may be extended to two years or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case revolves around the validity of the plaintiff's claim for recovery of a sum of Rs. 3,17,500/- with interest thereupon at the rate of 18% p.a. from the defendant company and its agent. The plaintiff alleges that he supplied 200 bags of coffee seeds to the defendant company on the basis of consignment. The defendant company denies the allegation, claiming that the coffee was purchased from one Sri G.S.S. Seshsegowda, who has taken away the sale cost of the coffee.\n\nIn its judgment, the lower court answered issue Nos.1 and 3 in the affirmative and issue No.2 in the negative. It found that the plaintiff had established his claim for recovery.\n\nUpon critical assessment, the lower court's judgment appears to be based on logical reasoning and adequate evidence presented. The alteration in the initials of the supplier's name in Ex.P-1, the cheques issued to the supplier of the coffee seeds which are at Exs.C-1 and C-2, and the documents at Exs.D-1 to D-4 and D-8 to D-13, all point towards the plaintiff's claim being genuine. Furthermore, the defendant company's own documents cast doubt on their case, as they claim they advanced Rs. 3 lakhs, which according to them, was 100% of the alleged sale value, while the maximum percentage of advance that the company could pay before the sale of the coffee would be only 25%.\n\nConsidering the evidence and legal arguments presented, it is apparent that the lower court's decision is well-founded. Hence, the appeal should be dismissed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThough this matter is listed in the Admission list, however, with the consent of both side, the matter is taken up for final disposal, for which purpose, learned counsel from both side provided the certified copies of the depositions and other documents pertaining to the matter. The present appellant, as a complainant, had instituted a private complaint against the present respondent/accused under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure, alleging an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'N.I.Act').  The said case was tried by the learned XVI Addl.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru City (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'trial Court'), in C.C.No.1080/2011, which by its judgment dated 19.02.2015, acquitted the accused (respondent herein) for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. It is against the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal. The summary of the case of the appellant/complainant in the trial Court is that the respondent/accused and himself were the neighbours and were residing in the same Lane at Jayanagara, Bengaluru. As such, they were in acquaintance with each other and had become friends. The respondent/accused approached him on 5.10.2006, with a request of hand loan of a sum of Rs. 13 lakhs. Considering the said request and noticing that the accused was in need of money for his legal necessities, complainant lent him a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs on 10.10.2006 and another sum of Rs. 3 lakhs on 17.11.2006, both in cash. Though the accused had agreed to repay the entire loan amount within an year from the said date, but, he failed to do so. However, on repeated request and demands made by the complainant, the accused issued him a post-dated cheque bearing No.367273, drawn on Bank of India, J.C.Road Branch, Bengaluru, on 15.2.2010, by putting the date on the cheque as 23.8.2010. When the said cheque was presented for realisation, it returned unrealised with the Bank's shara \"account closed/transferred\", vide the memo of the Banker dated 24.8.2010. It is against the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nIt is the further contention of the complainant that thereafter, he issued a legal notice to the accused, both through the Registered Post Acknowledgement Due and under Certificate of Posting, on 22.9.2010. Despite receipt of the said legal notice, the accused neither paid the demanded amount, nor replied to the legal notice, which constrained him to institute a complaint under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure.  It is the contention of the appellant in his memorandum of appeal, as well the argument of learned counsel for the appellant that the finding of the trial Court to the effect that the complainant failed to establish that he was financially in a capacity to lend the alleged loan amount, is an erroneous finding. The complainant being in the business of Jewellary articles and was running Shroff (jewellary shop), was financially sound, as such, the accused being a neighbour and a known person, the amount was paid in cash to him. It is also the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the accused has not even responded to the legal notice issued to him. On the other hand, as admitted in his evidence, he was frequently availing the hand loan from the complainant.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe learned counsel appearing for the respondent/accused in his arguments submitted that the purpose of loan has been shown in the complaint as for legal necessity of the accused whereas, in the evidence of the complainant, it is stated to have been taken for construction work, as such, they do not go together.  However, despite the complainant stating that he has drawn the alleged loan amount, had failed to produce any statement of the Bank nor has shown the said loan transaction in his Income-tax returns. As such, the judgment under appeal does not warrant any interference in it.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nhe trial Court after recording the evidence led by both sides and hearing both sides, by its judgment dated 19.2.2015, acquitted the respondent/accused of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I.Act. \n",
    "Case_Result": "The complainant got himself examined as PW-1, whereas, the respondent/accused himself got examined as DW-1. The complainant got marked documents from Exs.P-1 to P-8, which includes the alleged dishonoured original cheque at Ex.P-1, the Bank's Memo at Ex.P-3 and copy of the legal notice at Ex.P-4. No documents were marked as exhibits in the evidence of DW-1. The complainant as PW-1 in his evidence has reiterated the contentions taken up by him in his complaint. He has stated that the accused was known to him and they were residing in the same street at Jayanagar, Bengaluru. The said evidence about their acquaintance with each other has not been denied by the accused. On the contrary, the accused as DW-1, in his evidence has admitted that the complainant was known to him.he complainant as PW-1 in his evidence has stated that at the specific request by the accused, he has lent a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs on the date 10.10.2006 and in the same month, once again he has lent him another sum of Rs. 3 lakhs, thus in total, a sum of Rs. 13 lakhs. He has also stated that the said loan amount was paid to the accused in cash in the denomination of Rs. 500/- currency notes. No doubt, in his cross-examination, he has stated that he had drawn the amount prior to giving it to the accused and had kept the same in his house, however, he has not produced any statement of the bank account. He has also admitted a suggestion as true that he had the knowledge that any amount more than Rs. 20,000/- was not required to be made in the form of cash. It is based on these statements of PW-1 in his cross-examination, the learned counsel for the accused in his arguments submitted that these aspects have raised a reasonable suspicion in the mind of the trial Court, which considering the same, has pronounced the judgment of acquittal.It is noteworthy that, no where in the cross-examination of PW-1, the accused has denied the alleged loan transaction. Not even a single sentence suggestion was made in the cross-examination of the PW-1 to the effect that at no point of time, any loan amount was availed by the accused from the complainant, much less, Rs. 10 lakhs + Rs. 3 lakhs = Rs. 13 lakhs, as alleged by the complainant. Thus, the very primary statement of the complainant that the accused had borrowed a loan of Rs. 13 lakhs from him has not been specifically denied in the cross-examination of PW-1. On the contrary, DW-1 in his evidence by himself has stated that, now and then, he was availing hand loan from the complainant. He has also stated that his request for returning the cheque after clearance of the loan amount has not been acceded to by the complainant. Thus, the accused by himself making such a statement in his evidence has not only shown that he was now and then availing the hand loan from the complainant, but, also has admitted that the cheque in question has been issued by him. Added to the above, DW-1/accused in his evidence has responded to the suggestion made by the complainant to the effect that the complainant was financially sound to lend so much of money by stating that he is not aware of the same. Had it been the contention of the accused that the complainant was financially not capable or was not in a sound condition to lend him such a huge amount, then, it was expected of the accused to deny the suggestion rather than pleading his ignorance. Merely pleading an ignorance cannot be taken as a specific denial of a suggestion put to the witness. In such a situation, more particularly, in a case like this where the accused has not denied the loan transaction and also issuance of a cheque, and more particularly, the alleged financial condition of the complainant, the legal presumption under Section 139 of N.I.Act, crystallizes in favour of the complainant.The said aspect, the trial Court has not properly considered. On the contrary, it has been carried away by a stray statement made by PW-1 in his cross-examination to the effect that he was aware of the fact that the transaction beyond Rs. 20,000/- was not required to be made in cash and that the alleged loan transaction was not shown in the Income-tax returns. It is not known, under what Section of Income-tax Act and under which column of Income-tax return, the assessee was expected to disclose the alleged loan transaction in favour of the accused, it is because, it is nobody's case in this matter that the complainant, as an income-tax assessee, was submitting his returns along with statement of account or balance sheet. In such an event, without establishing as to what type of return the complainant was hitherto filing prior to filing of the private complaint and whether those returns were requiring him to disclose the alleged loan transaction, mere jumping into conclusion that the alleged loan transaction has not been reflected in the Income-tax return, cannot be accepted as a convincing reason. Even though the accused has taken a contention that the legal notice alleged to have been issued by the complainant has not been received by him, but, in his cross-examination as DW-1, on a specific suggestion that the legal notice has been served upon him and the said notice was served to his wife, has not been specifically denied by the accused. On the other hand, with respect to the said suggestion also, he has pleaded his ignorance. Thus, merely stating that he does not know whether the legal notice was served upon him, cannot be construed as the legal notice has not been served upon him. Therefore, when the respondent/accused himself has stated that there were frequent loan transactions between himself and the complainant, where himself was borrower and has also impliedly admitted the issuance of a cheque and further when he has not made any attempt to secure the cheque back by making any specific demand in that regard even after alleged repayment of the loan, it cannot be said that the complainant has failed to establish that in return for the consideration passed from him to the accused, the cheque in question was issued to him. Further, the statement made by the accused as DW-1, in his cross-examination, that he had returned the amount to the complainant, also go to show that he has impliedly admitted the alleged loan transaction. Had it been the case of the accused that he had repaid the alleged loan amount, then, he was expected to produce any evidence either oral or documentary corroborating his statement. For all these reasons and more particularly, considering the fact that no where in the cross-examination of PW-1, the accused has denied the alleged loan transaction, on the contrary, the accused, as DW-1, himself has admitted his acquaintance with the complainant and he availing now and than the hand loans from the complainant and also considering the fact that he has impliedly admitted the issuance of cheque and though has stated in his cross-examination that he has returned the amount to the complainant, but, has failed to establish the same, it has to be necessarily come to a conclusion that the complainant has proved his case beyond reasonable doubt. Order accordingly",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4e498bd6a9795e96fe\n**Facts**: Though this matter is listed for Admission, with the consent of learned counsel from both side, the same is heard finally.  The complaint of the present appellant filed in the Court of the XX Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru City (hereinafter referred to as the \"Trial Court\" for the sake of brevity), resulted in acquittal of the accused/respondent by the trial Court by its judgment dated 21.07.2015. Challenging the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.  It is the summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court that the accused was his student, as such, the accused is a person known to him. It is in this context the complainant lent him a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/- in the month of July-2012, on the condition that the accused should repay the same within two months thereafter. However, the accused failed to repay the said amount at the demand made by the complainant.  The accused issued him a cheque dated 01.10.2012, for a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/-, in the last month of September 2012. When the same was presented for realisation, it returned dishonoured with an endorsement that \"account closed\". According to the complainant, thereafter, he issued a statutory notice to the accused and the same came to be returned un-served. Thereafter, the complainant filed a complaint under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Cr.P.C.\" for the sake of brevity) against the accused in the trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the \"N.I. Act\" for the sake of brevity). For the sake of convenience, the parties would be referred to as per their ranks before the trial Court. The accused appeared and contested the matter.  In order to prove his case, the complainant got himself examined as PW.1 and got marked documents as per Exs.P-1 to 7. The accused got himself examined as DW.1 and got marked documents as per Exs.D-1 to 12.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  After hearing both side, the trial Court by its judgment dated 21.07.2015, acquitted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. It is against the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the appellant while reiterating the contention of the appellant taken in the Memorandum of Appeal submitted that the trial Court has erred in not giving the benefit of presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act in favour of the appellant. He also submitted that the trial Court also lost sight of the fact that the parties were known to each other and the appellant who had surplus fund after selling his house property lent a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/- to the accused.  According to the complainant, the occasion to lend money to the accused arose to him only for the reason that the accused was his student. It is for the said reason when the accused is said to have approached him for financial assistance in the month of July-2012, he gave him a hand loan of Rs. 1,15,000/-, towards repayment of which, the accused gave him the cheque in question. The complainant in his evidence as PW.1, has reiterated the said contention. However, in his cross-examination when specific questions were put from the side of the accused as to in which year and in which school the accused was his student, the complainant could only say that the accused was his student in Siddaganga Mutt High School.  However, he has stated that he does not remember as to which year the accused was his student. A specific suggestion was made to the complainant in his cross-examination to the effect that the accused has never been his student and that he has not studied in Siddaganga Mutt, on the other hand, the accused has completed his High School at Sri. Basaveshwara High School at Kolala of Tumakuru District. In order to support the said contention of the accused that he was a student of Sri. Basaveshwara High School at Kolala of Tumakuru District, he has also produced the certified copy of his SSLC marks card at Ex.D-10, Certified copy of the character certificate at Ex.D-11 and certified copy of the cumulative record at Ex.D-12. Those documents remained undenied and they clearly show that the accused has completed his 10th standard in the year April-1980 from Sri. Basaveshwara High School, Kolala. Thus, the first statement of the complainant that the accused was a person known to him as his student in Siddaganga Mutt High School, has been falsified by the accused by leading not only rebuttal evidence, but also producing cogent documents and confronting the same in the cross-examination of PW.1.  It is the contention of the complainant that the accused has been a resident of Hanumanthagiri Village, Kolala Hobli, Koratagere Taluk, Tumakuru District, as such the legal notice as required under Section 138 of the N.I. Act was sent to him to the said address. The contention of the accused was that he is a permanent resident of Bengaluru, as such, the question of he residing at Hanumanthagiri Village, Kolala Hobli, Koratagere Taluk, Tumakuru District, does not arise. It is for the said reason, the legal notice at Ex.P-5 returned to the sender/complainant without its service upon the addressee. It is in that regard, apart from making suggestions to the complainant in his cross-examination as PW.1, the accused has also produced certain documents showing his address proof at Bengaluru and those documents include the certified copy of the rental agreement at Ex.D-1, certified copy of the gas connection application at Ex.D-2, certified copy of bank pas books at Exs.D-3 and 4, certified copies of the school identity cards of the daughters of the accused at Exs.D-5 and 6, so also their marks cards at Exs.D-7 and 8.  The accused has also produced the certified copy of his EPIC card at Ex.D-9. All these documents clearly go to show that the accused is not the resident of Hanumanthagiri Village, Kolala Hobli, Koratagere Taluk, Tumakuru District, but he is a resident of Kamakshipalya, Bengaluru and Basaveshwara Nagar, Bengaluru and those documents produced by the accused clearly establishes that all those documents reveal the address at Bengaluru as that of the place of residence of both accused and his school going daughters. When this aspect was put in the mouth of the complainant in his cross-examination, the complainant as PW.1 has stated that since the mother of the accused was at Kolala, he presumed that the accused was residing there and as such, notice was sent to that address. The complainant has not denied the place of residence or the address of the accused at Bengaluru. However, based upon certain assumptions made by him, the complainant has sent notice to such an address which was not the address or the place of residence of the accused, as such, the notice at Ex.P-5 has been returned un-served. Thus, there is non-compliance of service of statutory notice, which service of notice is mandatory as provided under Section 138(b) of the N.I. Act.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent/accused in his argument submitted that the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption existing in favour of the appellant. The accused could able to establish that the complainant was a stranger to him and that under no circumstance, the cheque in question was issued to him by the accused bilaterally.  The cheque issued to one Smt. Meenakshamma as security to the loan, was misused by filling the contents by the complainant. He also submitted that the accused has proven his case to the effect that he was not at all a resident of the address to which the notice has been sent by the complainant. As such, there is no compliance of the statutory requirement of service of notice upon the accused before filing the complaint.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  Section 139 of the N.I. Act makes out a presumption in favour of the payee/holder of the cheque. Unless and until the accused rebuts in a process known to law, the presumption that the cheque was issued in favour of the payee for a legally enforceable debt or liability, would be presumed under law. In the instant case even after keeping the said presumption under consideration in favour of the complainant, when the materials placed before this Court are analysed, the following points can be noticed: The accused in the cross-examination of PW.1 has also raised a doubt about the availability of the fund or the source of fund with the complainant to lend loan of Rs. 1,15,000/-. It is in that connection that the complainant has stated that in the month of March-2012, he had sold his house property for a sum of Rs. 5,50,000/- and has retained the sale proceeds in his bank account. It is to lend money to the accused he has withdrawn a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/-, fifteen days prior to the said loan transaction from the said bank. The complainant as PW.1 has also stated that he could able to produce the bank statement for having drawn such amount from his bank account. However, despite making such statement when there was a specific suggestion that there was no source of fund for the complainant to lend money, the complainant has not produced any of the bank account details to show that there was sufficient fund in his bank account by which he has withdrawn Rs. 1,15,000/-, which he has contended in the cross-examination.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe appellant, a complainant, had instituted a private complaint against the respondent/accused under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure, alleging an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The trial court acquitted the respondent/accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. The appeal is against the said judgment of acquittal. The summary of the case of the appellant/complainant in the trial Court is that the respondent/accused and himself were the neighbours and were residing in the same Lane at Jayanagara, Bengaluru. As such, they were in acquaintance with each other and had become friends. The respondent/accused approached him on 5.10.2006, with a request of hand loan of a sum of Rs. 13 lakhs.

The complainant being in the business of Jewellery articles and was running Shroff (jewellery shop), was financially sound, as such, the accused being a neighbour and a known person, the amount was paid in cash to him. It is also the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the accused has not even responded to the legal notice issued to him. On the other hand, as admitted in his evidence, he was frequently availing the hand loan from the complainant.\n\nThe respondent contends that the purpose of loan has been shown in the complaint as for legal necessity of the accused whereas, in the evidence of the complainant, it is stated to have been taken for construction work, as such, they do not go together.  However, despite the complainant stating that he has drawn the alleged loan amount, had failed to produce any statement of the Bank nor has shown the said loan transaction in his Income-tax returns. As such, the judgment under appeal does not warrant any interference in it.\n\nThe section 138 of N.I.Act provides that if any person draws an instrument which he knows will not be honoured by the drawee, and  presents that instrument to the payee or holds out the instrument to the payee with the intention of inducing the payee to accept the instrument, and the payee accepts the instrument, and the instrument is dishonoured by the bank, the person who drew the instrument is guilty of an offence.\n\nThe ingredients of the offence under section 138 of the N.I.Act are: (i) that the accused has drawn an instrument; (ii) that the accused knows that the instrument will be dishonoured by the banker on which it is drawn; (iii) that the accused presents the instrument to the payee or the holder in order to obtain credit; (iv) that the payee draws the instrument in favour of the accomplice of the accused; and (v) that the instrument is dishonoured by the bank.\n\nIn the instant case, the complainant has proved that the accused had drawn a cheque for Rs. 13 lakhs in favour of the complainant, knowing it full well that he had insufficient funds to honour the same. The accused presented the said cheque to the complainant for payment of the amount alleged to be due by him to the complainant. The cheque was dishonoured by the bank and the amount was not paid to the complainant. The cheque was issued for the purpose of discharging the debt alleged to be due by the accused to the complainant.\n\nThe accused has not been able to explain as to why he issued the cheque when he knew that he did not have sufficient funds to honour the same. The cheque was dishonoured by the bank and the amount was not paid to the complainant. The accused has not been able to explain as to why he issued the cheque when he knew that he did not have sufficient funds to honour the same.\n\nThe trial court has wrongly taken the view that the complainant has not proved that he was financially in a position to advance the loan. The complainant being in the business of Jewellery articles and was running Shroff (jewellery shop), was financially sound, as such, the accused being a neighbour and a known person, the amount was paid in cash to him. \n\nThe respondent has not been able to prove that the loan was advanced for any purpose other than legal necessity. It is not the case of the respondent that the loan advanced was utilised for any other purpose.\n\nIn view of the above, the judgment of the trial court acquitting the respondent is not sustainable in law.\n\nThe appeal is allowed and the judgment of the trial court is set aside. The respondent is convicted under section 138 of the N.I.Act and sentenced to suffer simple imprisonment for one month and to pay fine of Rs. 10,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to suffer further simple imprisonment for one month.\n\nIf the fine is paid within one month from today, the sentence of simple imprisonment shall stand reduced to further simple imprisonment for one week.\n\nIn case of default in payment of fine, the respondent shall surrender before the concerned jail authorities for undergoing the sentence of simple imprisonment for one month. \n\nS.R.

The appellant had initiated the said complaint under Section 200 of Criminal Procedure Code against the present respondent for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (herein after referred to as the 'N.I. Act' for short). The summary of the case of the complainant in the court below is that the complainant and the accused were well known to each other and were friends since several years. At the request of accused, the complainant lent him a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- as hand loan which the respondent/accused had undertaken to repay.

However, the cheque came to be dishonoured when presented for realization.  The complainant issued a legal notice in that regard to the respondent which he did not respond to.

Though this matter was listed in the orders list, with the consent, it has been taken up for final disposal.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe learned counsel for the appellant in his arguments contended that the court below has committed an error by not properly appreciating the materials, particularly, it has ignored the legal presumption that was required to be drawn in favour of the complainant, merely because the complainant was found to have not convinced the court regarding his capacity to lend, the court has acquitted the accused.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThere is no representation from respondent's side and no arguments from accused's side was addressed to this Court. \nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe court below, after recording the evidence led by both sides and after hearing the arguments by both sides, by its impugned judgment dated 19.01.2015, acquitted the accused/respondent from the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I.Act.\n",
    "Case_Result": "A perusal of the evidence let-in in the court below by PW1 goes to show that even though the complainant in his examination-in-chief reiterated the contention taken up by him in his complaint, but in his cross examination, he has stated that he does not belong to middle-class category but belongs to lower middle-class category and that his annual income is only Rs. 50,000/- to Rs. 60,000/- in which he has to maintain four members in his family. Further, he has also stated in his cross-examination that he does not remember the exact date when the alleged loan was given to the accused. He has also stated that he does not even remember the date when the cheque in question was given to him. He has denied all these assertio ns made to him. In his furt her cro ss-examination, he has further stated that he is a Below Poverty Line (BPL) Card holder. He also admitted the suggestion as true that in the year 2010-2011, by mortgaging the property bearing Sy.No.90/P7 of Srinivasapura, he has availed agricultural loan from PLD Bank. n his subsequent cross-examination dated 12.09.2014, he has admitted a suggestion as true that on 24.01.2011, he himself has availed loan of Rs. 1 lakh. It has also come in his cross-examination that the Bank extract produced by him only reveals that in a span of one and half years, there was only transaction upto a sum of Rs. 50,000/- in his Bank account. These aspects go to show that economically he was not in a sound position to lend. He himself has obligation of taking care of his family comprising of not less than four members in his limited annual income of Rs. 50,000/-. His total Bank transaction was not more than Rs. 50,000/- in a span of one and half years. The complainant himself has admitted that he himself was a borrower of Rs. 1 lakh from PLD Bank by mortgaging his property. By elucidating admissions and statements in the cross-examination of the complainant, the accused/respondent has been able to rebut the presumption which was in favour of the complainant. This prevents the court from believing that there was any legally enforceable debt for a sum of Rs. 1,50,000/- between the parties. Appeal dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4e498bd6a9795e9703\n**Facts**: The appellant has challenged the judgment of acquittal dated 30.3.2010, passed by the learned XVII Addl.Small Causes Judge & XXV Addl.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru, in C.C.No.28351/2007 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'trial Court'), acquitting the present respondent herein for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'N.I.Act'). The summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court is that himself and the respondent are friends. The respondent approached him for hand loan of a sum of Rs. 1 lakh in September 2006 and obtained the said loan from him promising to repay the same within six months thereafter. The respondent also gave him a cheque on 5.2.2007, bearing No.409791, for Rs. 1 lakh. On presentation, the cheque came to be dishonoured for want of funds.  A legal notice as required under Section 138 of N.I.Act was also issued to the respondent demanding repayment of the amount. Since the respondent failed to meet the demand made under the notice, the complainant filed a private complaint against him under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act, which came to be numbered as C.C.No.28351/2007.  The complainant in support of his case before the trial Court got examined himself as PW-1 and got marked documents at Exs.P-1 to P-12, which includes the alleged returned cheque, legal notice and postal receipt. On the other hand, the accused got himself examined as DW-1 and got marked a copy of the reply said to have been given by him to the notice sent by the complainant and a postal acknowledgement.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The trial Court after recording the evidence led by both side and hearing both side, by its impugned judgment of acquittal dated 30.3.2010, acquitted the respondent/accused of the alleged offence. It is against the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the appellant in her arguments, while reiterating the contention taken up by the appellant in his memorandum of appeal, submitted that when admittedly the issuance of cheque by the respondent/accused in favour of the complainant has come on record and the defence taken by the accused was not tenable, the trial Court was erred in passing a judgment of acquittal only for the reason that the alleged loan was not reflected in the Income-tax Return of the complainant and also by finding that there was no presumption to be made in favour of the complainant.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/accused in his brief arguments submitted 2. that it is unbelievable that the complainant if at all had lent a sum of Rs. 1 lakh to the accused, failed to collect any other document, like the Promissory Note, evidencing the alleged loan. He further submitted that such a huge amount was paid in cash but not through any negotiable instrument is also not believable. It is for the said reason, the trial Court has rightly pronounced the judgment of acquittal.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: From the reading of the evidence of both side, it is clear that the acquaintance between the parties is not in dispute. Both of them have admitted that they know each other. It has also come in the evidence of PW-1 and in the cross-examination of PW-1 that he is doing the work of construction of building and sale of building and is also an Income-tax assessee, whereas, DW-1 is shown to be running two Xerox shops. The complainant as PW-1 has stated that he does not remember the date when accused approached him for loan, but, has stated that, it was in September 2006. According to him, the loan was paid in cash. Admittedly, the complainant is an Income-tax assessee. The accused in the form a suggestion made to PW-1, has suggested that it was the complainant who approached him in the month of February 2007, requesting for a hand loan, for which, the accused gave him a cheque as per Ex.P-1. However, since he could not pool up the funds to honour the cheque, the same was returned. The complainant has not admitted those suggestions as true. On the other hand, from the side of the complainant, in the cross-examination of DW-1, it has been suggested that the accused did not have the sufficient amount in his account when he issued the cheque at Ex.P-1.  The accused as DW-1 has also stated in his cross-examination that after the dishonour of the cheque at Ex.P-1 or after receiving the notice, he has neither asked the complainant for returning of the said cheque nor given any police complaint in that regard. The accused has also stated that he has not given notice to the complainant asking him to return the cheque. To the height of which, the accused has also admitted a suggestion as true that he was having financial crisis in September 2006. He further admitted a suggestion as true that there are two other criminal cases pending against him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. It is in the light of the above admissions made by both side in their cross-examination and the evidence led by them, the case has to be looked into. Section 139 of the N.I.Act lays down a presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque. As per the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Rangappa -vs- Sri Mohan {2010 (11) SCC 441}, when once the issuance of cheque from the drawer of the instrument in favour of the payee is proved, there would be a legal presumption as to the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability towards the payee of the cheque, who is the complainant herein.  However, the said presumption is rebuttable. As such, in the instant case, when the accused as DW-1 himself has categorically admitted that he had issued the cheque at Ex.P-1 to the complainant and also has admitted his signature in the said instrument, there comes into a presumption in favour of the complainant with regard to the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability from the drawer of the instrument towards the complainant. However, the said presumption is rebuttable. The accused in order to rebut the said presumption, has taken a defence in his side that it was the complainant himself who had requested for a loan of Rs. 1 lakh from him. It is in that regard, a cheque for Rs. 1 lakh, which is at Ex.P-1, was given to him. The said defence was taken in the form of a mere suggestion made to PW-1 in his cross-examination. However, the said suggestion has not been admitted as true by PW-1.  Thus, the defence of the accused is confined only to a suggestion made to the other side witness. When the accused is expecting some more document other than mere cheque from the complainant to establish that he had lent a sum of Rs. 1 lakh the same analogy would apply even to the accused also. By applying which, it can be seen that even the accused who claims to have agreed to lend a sum of Rs. 1 lakh and said to have issued a cheque to the complainant as per Ex.P-1, has not collected any other document, including a Promissory Note or an Agreement or a chit, to show that it was a loan extended by the accused to the complainant. Therefore, in the absence of any corroborative material or evidence, the mere statement made by the accused that the said cheque was given by him to the complainant as a loan is difficult to believe. It is also for the reason that, as admitted by the accused himself as DW-1 that during the period of September 2006, which according to the complainant is the month when he extended hand loan to the accused, the accused was in financial crises. Thus, a person who is in financial crises and is running only two Xerox shops and is also facing two similar criminal cases for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act, makes it difficult to believe in the circumstances of the case that he was in a position to lend Rs. 1 lakh to the complainant. On the other hand, admittedly the complainant is a constructor and vendor of buildings, that means, he was involved in the development of buildings and sale of it and he was also an Income-tax assessee.  Thus, the presumption which has already existed in favour of the complainant, could not be rebutted by the accused though he has led his evidence. This aspect, the trial Court, did not appreciate in its proper perspective. It carried away by a mere notion that the complainant being an Income-tax assessee, has not reflected the said loan transaction in his Income-tax return. The trial Court was not satisfied by itself as to under which provision of Income-tax Act, an assessee is required to declare each and every aspect of his loan transaction to the Assessing Authority. No such details have been elicited in the cross-examination of PW-1 also. In that scenario, merely because the complainant was an Income-tax assessee, jumping into a conclusion that since the alleged hand loan was not reflected in his Income-tax return would stand as a rebuttable presumption in his favour, is not required to be considered as a sound reasoning.  Thus, the entire judgment of the trial Court being on the said point of non-declaration of the alleged transaction in the Income-tax return of the complainant and as such, arriving at a conclusion that there was no ground for presumption, it has to be said that the said finding of the trail Court was erroneous.  On the other hand, as observed above, the admitted fact that the cheque at Ex.P-1 was issued by the accused to the complainant and the fact of dishonour of the said cheque for insufficiency of funds when presented for realisation, would entitle the complainant for a presumption under Section 139 of the N.I.Act in his favour. A mere suggestion made by the accused in the cross-examination of PW-1 and a statement made by the accused as DW-1 in his examination-in-chief to the effect that the said cheque in question was given by him as a loan to the complainant could not be proved for the reasons analysed above.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "DISMISSED.\n\nThe lower court erred in its judgment by not properly appreciating the materials and ignoring the legal presumption required to be drawn in favor of the complainant. The complainant's capacity to lend the money is not disputed, and the respondent's failure to repay the loan or explain his dishonored cheque strongly indicates his guilty mind. The evidence presented by the complainant is sufficient to prove the offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. Since the legal presumption arises, the accused's acquittal cannot be sustained. The appeal is therefore allowed, and the lower court's judgment is set aside, and the respondent is convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act."

It was alleged that on 15.11.2007, the accused printed, published, distributed, advertised and circulated derogatory / defamatory pamphlets in public places. The petitioner who is accused No.2 in PCR No.277/2011 pending in the Court of the Additional Civil Judge and JMFC at Mandya (henceforth for brevity referred to as \"the Trial Court\") has challenged the order dated 30.12.2011 passed by the trial Court in the said PCR, wherein, it has ordered for registration of case and issuance of summons to accused Nos.1 to 14 before it, for the offences punishable under Sections 500, 501, 502 of IPC.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n It is the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the complaint is filed by the General Power of Attorney Holder, as such, the private complaint filed under Section 200 Cr.P.C is not maintainable. According to the learned counsel, since the General Power of Attorney holder would not have the personal knowledge of the alleged defamation, is not competent to file a private complaint for the alleged offences.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nLearned counsel for the respondents in his argument relied upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of John Thomas Vs. Dr.K.Jagadeesan reported in 2001 SCC (Cri) 974, wherein a complaint for defamation punishable under Section 199 of IPC against hospital by name \"K.J.Hospital\" was filed by one of its Director Dr.K.Jagadeesan (respondent before the Hon'ble Apex Court).  The maintainability of the said complaint, not by the hospital, but by one of its Director was challenged. The Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to observe that under Section 199 of Cr.P.C the collocation of the words \"by some persons aggrieved\" definitely indicates that complainant need not necessarily be the defamed person himself. Further, observing that even if the libelous imputation are not made directly against the person, but, it has the reasons to feel hurt, he has locus standi to file a complaint, Hon'ble Apex Court was pleased to dismiss the appeal.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n The trial Court after taking cognizance of the matter, on 28.07.2011 had proceeded to record the sworn statement of the Power of Attorney Holder Sri.K.T.Dhanukumar on 03.10.2011 and proceeded to pass the impugned order, ordering for issuance of summons on 30.12.2011.\n",
    "Case_Result": ". In the same case, the Hon'ble Apex Court was also pleased to observe that Magistrate had taken cognizance of the complaint, without prima facie establishing the fact, as to, whether the Power of Attorney existed in the first place and whether it was in order. Further, complaint against the appellant therein was not preferred by the payee or the holder in due course and the statement of oath of the person who filed the complaint has also not stated that he filed the complaint having been instructed by the payee or holder in due course of the cheque. With the said observation, the Apex Court was pleased to hold that it was not open for the Magistrate to take cognizance and the appeals were allowed.In the instant case, the private complaint filed clearly go to show that in the beginning paragraph ie., in Paragraph No.3 itself, the complainant has stated that he being the member of the Parliament and present President of J.D(S) Party in Karnataka, it is practically not possible and difficult for him to be present in the Court on all the dates of hearing, so as to assist, as such, he is being duly represented by a General Power of Attorney holder on his behalf to prosecute the case and he has been duly instructed, aware of the facts of the case in hand. Thus, the petition in the opening paragraph itself clearly mentions not only the fact that the Power of Attorney holder has been specifically instructed and authorized to institute the complaint but also he has the knowledge of the facts of the case.In the instant case, the General Power of Attorney, a copy of which is produced for reference during the course of argument shows that the executant of the Power of Attorney ie., Sri.H.D.Kumaraswamy has stated that he is being aggrieved by the alleged act of the accused for which he intended to file a private complaint against the office bearers of a particular association and also publishers mentioned in the pamphlets. It is because of his pre occupation and inability to appear personally in the Court and to conduct the case, he is appointing Sri.K.T.Dhanukumar as his General Power of Attorney holder. Thereafter, he has prescribed as to what powers the Power of Attorney Holder has got to exercise on his behalf. Thus, it is clear that Sri.H.D.Kumaraswamy, in whose name the Power of Attorney has instituted the complaint in question has authorized the Power of Attorney to institute the present complaint and to prosecute the accused on his behalf. Further, in the very complaint itself, the complainant has stated that the General Power of Attorney holder has been duly instructed and also aware of the facts of the case in hand.

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "**Summary:** The main issue of the case revolves around the maintainability of a private complaint filed by the General Power of Attorney Holder (Dhanukumar) for alleged defamation against Sri.H.D.Kumaraswamy, the then member of the Parliament and Former Chief Minister of Karnataka. The lower court had ruled in favor of the complaint, ordering the issuance of summons to the accused.\n\n**Analysis:** According to the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, a private complaint for defamation punishable under Section 500, 501, and 502 of the IPC can be filed by \"some persons aggrieved.\" The lower court's decision to accept the complaint seems to be in accordance with the legal principles. The argument that the General Power of Attorney Holder lacks personal knowledge of the alleged defamation is not valid, as the locus standi of the complainant is not dependent on the fact that the libelous imputations are made directly against the person. In this case, the General Power of Attorney Holder has the reasons to feel hurt, making him eligible to file the complaint.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the appeal should be dismissed. The lower court has correctly applied the law and the arguments and evidence presented support the initial ruling. The one-word summary is: DISMISSED."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThese criminal revision petitions are filed by the accused challenging the Judgment and order passed by the Fast Track Judge, Udupi Disgtrict at Udupi in Crl.A. No.174/2007 dated 21.10.2010 whereby the Judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the learned Magistrate, Udupi in C.C.Nos.7895/2003, 7896/2003, 7897/2003, 7898/2003, 182/2005 and 1039/2005 has been confirmed. Facts in brief are that, one Raghu Poojary-original complainant, husband of the respondent herein, filed a private complaint against the petitioner for the alleged offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('Act' for short). During the pendency of the proceedings before the trial court, the said original complainant - Raghu Poojay died and his wife, the respondent herein, came on record and proceeded with the case.  The gist of the complaint is that the petitioner herein had taken hand loan of Rs. 80,000/- on 10.7.1999 from the complainant and agreed to repay the same within three months; on repeated demands, the petitioner issued 7 cheques for a total sum of Rs. 82,775/- drawn on Syndicate Bank, Kunjubettu Branch, Udupi on different dates. The complainant presented the cheques for encashment and the same were returned with an endorsement \"insufficient funds\". The petitioner having failed to repay the amount due despite the service of legal notice issued by the original complainant under Section 138 of the Act, a private complaint was filed against the petitioner. On such complaint being filed under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. cognizance of offence was taken and the case was registered against the petitioner herein, by the learned Magistrate.  The defence of the petitioner/accused was that he was running a financial institution in the name and style of \"M/s Ambagilu Finance Corporation at Ambagilu, Udupi taluk\" which was closed on 31.3.2002. Original complainant Raghu Poojary had deposited a sum of Rs. 20,000/- on 24.1.2000 and Rs. 40,000/- on 28.2.2000 for a period of five years, both with interest at 19.5% p.a. On the request made by the complainant to prematurely return the fixed deposit of Rs. 60,000/- with interest, seven cheques were issued totally amounting to Rs. 82,775/- as a security. Subsequently on 26.1.2002, the accused had returned the total amount of Rs. 82,775/- to the original complainant and the receipt of the said cash transfer was placed before the court, marked as Ex.D1.  PW-1, wife of the original complainant/respondent herein was examined on behalf of the complainant and accused was examined as DW-1. Hence, these revision petitions.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel for the petitioner placing reliance on Ex.D1 would submit that Rs. 82,775/- was paid in full to the original complainant on 26.1.2002 and his signature was also obtained on the said receipt which was marked as Ex.D1(a). The original complainant having demanded the deposited amount of Rs. 60,000/- prematurely with interest, 7 cheques were given to the original complainant as security on different dates. Subsequently, the said amount of Rs. 82,775/- being paid to the original complainant, no cause of action arose for the original complainant to present the cheques for encashment. PW-1, wife of the original complainant in her evidence feigned ignorance about the signature of the original complainant in Ex.D1 as well as other documents including vakalath filed before the court wherein, the original complainant had subscribed his signature. It was total denial of transaction of fixed deposits made by the complainant with the accused-Financier and the 7 cheques for a sum of Rs. 82,775/- given to the original complainant as security.  The courts below failed to appreciate the total denial of the complainant to these transactions in a right perspective. It is obvious that the PW-1 may be oblivious of the business transaction made by her husband during his lifetime but however she has failed to prove the loan transaction made by the accused with the complainant. The story created by the PW-1 wife of the original complainant inasmuch as the issuance of the 7 cheques in question to discharge the legal debt was believed by the courts below ignoring the evidence of DW-1 who established his case by marking Exs.D2 and D3, the fixed deposit receipts for Rs. 20,000/- and Rs. 40,000/-. Non-appreciation of the evidence in the satisfactory manner by the courts below has resulted in miscarriage of justice which calls for interference by this court.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThere is no representation on behalf of the respondent.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n. On appreciation of evidence, trial court convicted the accused under Section 138 of the Act passing sentence as under:\\n\\n\"In CC No.7895/2003, the appellant-accused was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 13,000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 8 months. Out of the fine amount Rs. 12,000/- shall be paid to the respondent/complainant as compensation and the remaining sum of Rs. 1,000/- shall go to the State. In CC No.7896/2003, the appellant/accused was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 11,000/- and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 8 months. Out of the fine amount, Rs. 10,000/- shall be paid to the respondent/complainant as compensation and the remaining sum of Rs. 1,000/- shall go to the State. In C.C. No.7897/2003, the appellant/accused was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 27,000/- and in default to undego simple imprisonment for a period of 8 moths.

In CC No.7898/2003 the appellant/accused was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 13,000/- and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 8 months. Out of the fine amount, Rs. 12,000/- shall be paid to the respondent/complainant as compensation and the remaining sum of Rs. 1,000/- shall go to the State. In C.C.No.182/2005, the appellant/accused was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 13,000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 8 months. Out of the fine amount, Rs. 12,000/- shall be paid to the respondent/complainant as compensation and the remaining sum of Rs. 1,000/- shall go to the State. In CC No.1039/2005, the appellant accused was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 13,000/- and in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 8 months. Out of the fine amount Rs. 12,000/- shall be paid to the respondent/complainant as compensation and the remaining sum of Rs. 1,000/- shall go to the State.\"  Being aggrieved by the same, accused preferred an appeal before the learned Sessions Judge in Crl.A.No.174/2007 which came to be dismissed confirming the order of the trial court. \n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n This Revision Petition is filed by the accused/petitioner calling in question the legality and correctness of the Judgment and order passed by the Fast Track Court, Udupi (Sessions Judge) in Crl. Revision Petition No.53/2010 whereby the order of the III Addl. Civil Judge (Jr.Dn) and JMFC at Udupi in CC No.6432/2007 has been set-aside, restoring the complaint filed by the respondent-complainant in PC No.643/2007 and CC No.6432/2007 to file. The respondent herein had filed a private complaint on the file of the learned JMFC, Udupi against the petitioner/accused alleging commission of offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('Act' for short). It was alleged that the petitioner had approached the respondent/complainant and sought for hand loan of Rs. 30 lakhs and accordingly the complainant has paid the sum of Rs. 30 lakhs to the accused on 16.1.2006 and towards the discharge of the said liability, the accused has issued the cheque bearing No.439685 dated 15.7.2007 drawn on Syndicate Bank, Anelkal, but the said cheque, on presentation, came to be dishonoured.  The learned Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence and ordered to register the case. Thereafter learned Magistrate was pleased to issue summons to the petitioner and petitioner entered appearance. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner placing reliance on catena of Judgments submitted that revision is maintainable before this court against the order of the Learned Sessions Judge passed U/s. 397 of Cr.P.C. It was argued that the order of dismissal for non-prosecution passed by the learned Magistrate tantamounts to an order under Section 256 of Cr.P.C. against which appropriate remedy was to file an appeal in accordance with law. Learned Sessions Judge had no jurisdiction to entertain and allow the Revision Petition, setting aside the order of dismissal.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n Learned counsel for the respondent at the outset raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the revision petition under Section 397 Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. Inviting the attention of the court to Section 397(3) of Cr.P.C., learned counsel submitted that no second Revision Petition is maintainable against the order passed under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. In addition to this preliminary objection, arguments were also addressed by the respondent/complainant on the jurisdiction of the learned Sessions Judge in entertaining the revision petition. Before adverting to the other points, it is appropriate for this court to first examine the maintainability of the Revision Petition under Section 397 of Cr.P.C. against the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge under Section 397 of Cr.P.C.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe said complaint came to be dismissed for non-prosecution on 14.5.2010 when the matter was listed for cross examination of the complainant.  Aggrieved by the said order of dismissal, complainant preferred revision petition under Section 397 of the Cr.P.C. before the learned Sessions Judge, Udupi, who allowed the revision petition setting aside the order of dismissal passed by the learned Magistrate and the complaint was restored to file. Aggrieved by the same, accused has filed this revision petition.\n",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 634ea1df0eb98db8410fb25f\n**Facts**: The petitioner who has been convicted by the learned Courts below for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 has filed the instant revision petition. he complainant/respondent had filed complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, (for short 'the Act'), on the grounds that the petitioner/accused had issued cheque No. RTQ 034402, dated 31.12.1999, amounting to Rs.53,200/- discharge of his liability. The cheque was dishonoured by the bank with the remarks \"insufficient funds\". The respondent thereafter issued legal notice on 5.1.2000 to the petitioner/accused calling upon him to make the payment within 15 days from the receipt of the notice. The legal notice was duly received by the petitioner but he did not make any payment.  The petitioner/accused was summoned and thereafter notice of accusation was put to him to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The complainant/respondent was directed to produce his evidence. In order to prove his case, the complainant examined four witnesses in all and closed his evidence. After completion of evidence, entire incriminating circumstances and evidence were put to the petitioner. The petitioner/accused in his defence examined three witnesses and closed his evidence.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The learned trial Court after evaluating the evidence and hearing the parties, convicted and sentenced the accused/petitioner to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months and imposed a fine of Rs.30,000/- out of which Rs.20,000/- was directed to be paid to the complainant/respondent as compensation and in default of payment of fine, the accused was directed to further undergo simple imprisonment of two months. The petitioner filed the appeal before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, however, the same were dismissed vide judgment dated 24.04.2009, constraining the petitioner to file the instant revision petition.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: It is vehemently argued by Shri G.D. Verma, Sr. Advocate, duly assisted by Shri B.C. Verma, Advocate that the findings recorded by the learned Courts below are perverse as respondent case does not fall under any of the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act and at best would amount to a civil dispute. 31. Learned counsel for the petitioner/accused would thereafter argue that complaint was bad for no-joinder of necessary party inasmuch as Smt. Prabhi Devi and Parkash Chand, who were specifically named in the agreement have not been arrayed as party and would place strong reliance upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court Jitendra Vora v. Bhavana Y. Shah and another, (2015) 16 SCC 744 2015 ILO SC 642.\n**Argument by Respondent**: On the other hand, Shri N.S. Chandel, Advocate, would support the findings rendered by the learned Courts below that the petitioner/accused had issued the cheques which are negotiable instruments and once the same was dishonoured, the petitioner was liable to be prosecuted and punished as per the provisions of the Act.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have carefully and meticulously gone through the records of the case. 7. Before proceeding to embark upon the relative merits of the case, it would be necessary to note the scope and power of this Court while dealing with such type of criminal revision petitions.  Section 138 of the Act was incorporated with a specific object of enacting a special provision to impose a strict liability so far as the negotiable instruments are concerned. . The purpose of attaching criminal liability to the offence under Section 138 of the Act, which is more in the nature of a civil dispute is only to ensure the credibility of cheques as Negotiable Instruments.  Reverting to the case in hand, it is rightly observed by the learned Courts below that there was no dispute regarding issuance of cheque by the petitioner/accused. It was dishonoured on account of \"insufficient funds\" and legal notice was served upon the petitioner/accused. Therefore, the only question left for consideration whether the cheque was issued for towards discharge of debt or other liability as envisaged under Section 138 of the Act. As observed earlier, the specific case of the petitioner/accused is that no case whatsoever is made out for commission of the offence under the Act and at best it is a case of Civil dispute and in support of his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner/accused has placed reliance upon the following judgments:- I have gone though the aforesaid judgment and find that the facts therein were that a complaint was filed against the proprietor of first firm and her Power of Attorney (wife and husband, respectively), when the said Power of Attorney had drawn cheques on first firm's account, when liability in discharge of which the dishonoured cheques had been issued was of second firm. The second firm which owed the liability was not impleaded nor even its proprietor was impleaded in that capacity. It was also found therein that the first firm had never taken on the liability of the second firm and thus the complaint was held to be not maintainable for mis-joinder of parties. However, this is not the fact situation obtaining in the instant case, therefore, the aforesaid judgment is not at all applicable to the facts of the present case.  At this stage, it would be necessary to reiterate that the learned Courts below have concurrently come to the findings that the petitioner had purchased land from the complainant being power of attorney of the owner of the land, however, he happened to have occupied more land than purchased by him and when this fact was detected, the parties entered into a compromise which was reduced in writing vide Ex. CW2/X dated 4.7.1999, wherein it was agreed that the petitioner/accused would make payment of the land un-authorisedly occupied by him. As per the compromise, the petitioner had issued a cheque bearing No. RTQ 034402, dated 31.12.1999 Ex.CW1/A of Rs.53,200/-, which was presented for payment to the bank concerned however the same was returned through memo Ext. CW1/B dated 4.1.2000 with endorsement \"insufficient funds\". Thereafter respondent issued notice under Section 138 of the Act but despite notice respondent did not pay the amount within the statutory period.  In support of the complaint, respondent had examined PW1 G.P. Pandey, Manager, Punjab National Bank, Solan, who stated that the cheque was dishonoured due to 'insufficient funds'. Similarly PW2 Tara Chand, the Cashier from State Bank of Patiala, Chambaghat exhibited the certificate Ex.CW2/A regarding the account of complainant to show that two cheques had been deposited in the account of the respondent/complainant, extract of account Ext.PW2/A. He further deposed that cheque had been returned to the bank by the Punjab National Bank through memo Ex.CW1/B as there was 'insufficient funds' in the account. PW3 Atma Ram has proved the agreement dated 4.7.1999 Ex.CW2/X wherein the petitioner had agreed to pay Rs.98,000/- to the complainant/respondent regarding which cheques worth Rs.53,200/- and Rs.44,800/-, respectively were issued in his presence and in the presence of one Haminder Thakur to the respondent. Notably he is one of the signatory to the agreement.  In rebuttal petitioner/accused examined DW1 Om Parkash Panwar from Punjab National Bank who have produced the record of cheque return register is Ex.CW1/C and stated that the in cheque return memo Ex. CW1/B, it was maintained that cheque was issued from the different account. While being cross- examined by the complainant, this witness categorically stated that on the day of presentation of cheque, the petitioner was having Rs.1309/- in his account and thus was having 'insufficient funds'.  DW2 Dalip Thakur, who was known to the parties has stated that he had got the matter compromised between the respondent and the petitioner and at that time DW3 Anil Gupta, Parkash Chand, Haminder and A.S. Minhas were also present when compromise Ex.CW2/X was written. He further stated that the petitioner had issued post dated cheques in favour of the respondent, but subsequently he was told that land regarding which payment was to be made was already in the name of Parkash Chand, therefore, he had got the payment stopped. In cross-examination, he stated that he was told by the accused that at the time of encashment of cheque worth Rs.53,200/- there was insufficient funds. He stated that he had written the compromise Ex.CW2/X.  He also admitted that it was agreed that 38 sq. metres of land of Parkash Chand and 32 sq. metres land of Prabhi Devi was encroached by the petitioner regarding which the petitioner had issued post dated cheques in favour of the respondent and witnesses had signed the compromise. DW3 Anil Gupta, who was present at the time of compromise Ex.CW2/X stated that petitioner has constructed his house and regarding the excess land he had issued post dated cheques in favour of the respondent, but subsequently he was told by the petitioner that the respondent could not execute the Registry, therefore, he got the payment stopped. In his cross- examination, this witness stated that he was working as Senior Manager in the bank and even DW2 Dalip Thakur was working in the same bank.  He admitted that the compromise was admitted by both the parties and thereafter was signed by the parties as well the witnesses and it was in lieu thereof the cheques had been issued. He further stated that there were about 5-7 persons present at the time when the compromise was written which was written with the intention that there may not be future dispute between the parties. . Thus, from the aforesaid narration, it stands established that there was no dispute with regard to the compromise Ex.CW2/X or the issuance of the post dated cheques in favour of the respondent. These facts not only proved by the respondent and his witnesses but even admitted by the witnesses examined by the petitioner. It is further proved on record that petitioner did not have sufficient funds in his account as it stands duly proved that petitioner had only Rs. 1309/- in his account. Petitioner had though tried to prove that he himself ordered \"stop payment\" because the land was already in the name of the Parkash Chand but the record clearly belies the version put-forth as it is a case where the cheque has not been dishonoured on account of 'stop payment' but on account of 'insufficient funds'. Further story put up by the petitioner through DW3 Anil Gupta that respondent was not in a position to execute the sale deed and therefore he got the payment stopped is also not borne out or rather is contrary to the record and again deserves to be rejected for the aforesaid reasons.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue in this case is whether the lower court's decision to set aside the dismissal of the private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is correct. The accused had issued a cheque for Rs. 30 lakhs, which was dishonoured, leading to the filing of a private complaint. The Magistrate dismissed the complaint for non-prosecution, and the complainant filed a revision petition under Section 397 of the Cr.P.C. The Sessions Judge allowed the revision petition, setting aside the dismissal of the complaint.\n\nIn assessing the lower court's judgment, Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act provides that a person is deemed to have committed an offence under Section 138 if the cheque is returned by the bank unpaid and the maker of the cheque makes default in complying with the direction in the summons issued under Section 143. The complainant's evidence in this case indicates that the cheque was dishonoured and a summons was issued. Therefore, the accused is liable for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\nThe lower court's decision to set aside the dismissal of the private complaint is correct, as the accused has committed an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The arguments and evidence presented support the initial ruling. The accused's claim that the revision is maintainable against the order of the learned Sessions Judge passed U/s. 397 of Cr.P.C. is not relevant to the substantive issue of the case. Therefore, the appeal should be allowed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThis Revision Petition is filed by the petitioner under Section 397 r/w 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure challenging the legality and correctness of the Judgment and order dated 12.11.2010 passed in Crl.A. No.151/2009 by the III Addl. Sessions Judge at Mysore confirming the Judgment and sentence dated 18.11.2009 passed in CC. No.2203/2007 by the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class-III, Mysore whereby the accused is convicted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('Act' for short) to pay fine of Rs. 1,10,000/- and in default of payment of said fine, he shall undergo S.I. for a period of six months. Out of the fine amount so realized, a sum of Rs. 1,09,000/- shall be paid to the complainant as compensation.  Facts in brief are that; the respondent filed a complaint alleging that he had initiated proceedings against the petitioner in C.C.No.687/2005 for the offences punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act. In the said proceeding, a compromise was arrived at and an agreement was executed on 16.06.2006, as per the said agreement the petitioner issued 2 cheques bearing No.029714 and 029715 for a sum of Rs. 75,000/- each drawn on Syndicate Bank, Uppinangadi Branch. It is further the case of the respondent that the cheques were dishonored on 14.05.2007 for the reasons 'Funds Insufficient'.  The respondent issued legal notice on 11.06.2007. The petitioner issued a reply stating that the entire amount was already repaid to the respondent and the entries have been made in the dairy Ex.D7.  Hence this Criminal Revision Petition.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe petitioner further contended that he had issued a legal notice dated 20.10.2006 calling upon the respondent to return the cheques inasmuch as the petitioner had already repaid the entire amount.  3. Learned counsel Sri.Manmohan appearing for the petitioner/accused would contend that two cheques issued by the accused are not towards discharge of any legally enforceable debt. It was pursuant to the settlement entered into between the parties in terms of Ex.P11, the cheques issued. Cheques issued pursuant to settlement would not satisfy the ingredients of Section 138 of the Act.  Secondly, it was argued that cheques were issued only as security to realise in the event of default in payment of amount for continuous period of one week as agreed between the parties in terms of the agreement dated 16.6.2006. Thirdly, it was argued that sufficient material was placed on record to demonstrate that the accused has cleared the settlement amount of Rs. 1,50,000/-, Ex.D7-the diary maintained by the accused, signed by the brother of the complainant for having received the amount of Rs. 1,50,000/- was not properly appreciated by the courts below. The legal notice dated 22.11.2006 issued by the accused to the complainant, requesting the complainant not to present two cheques in view of the full and final settlement of Rs. 1,50,000/- fortifies the amount discharged by the accused. Applying the doctrine of preponderance of probabilities, presumption under Section 139 of the Act has been rebutted by the accused by placing cogent evidence on record. However, Courts below failed to analyze the material evidence in a right perspective which resulted in miscarriage of justice. Reliance is placed on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of M.S.Narayana Menon Alias Mani-v-State of Kerala and another [(2006) 6 SCC 39]. Accordingly, learned counsel seeks for setting aside the impugned Judgment and order of the courts below allowing the Revision Petition.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nLearned counsel Sri.G.Ravishankar Shastry appearing for the respondent justifying the impugned Judgment and sentence of the courts below submitted that the diary, Ex.D7 clearly shows that the last payment was made on 21.10.2006 by the accused. The entries in the dairy, Ex.D7 was interpolated as observed by the court below. No interference is called for against the well reasoned judgment and order of the courts below.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe learned Magistrate by Judgment and order dated 18.11.2009 held that the respondent has admitted payment of Rs. 46,000/- by the petitioner and that the amount due to the respondent is Rs. 1,04,000/-.  The learned Magistrate held that the petitioner had manipulated the entries in Ex.D7 and hence the entire amount has not been repaid. The petitioner being aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by the learned Magistrate filed Crl.App.No.151/2009. The learned Sessions Judge by judgment and order dated 12.11.2010 dismissed the appeal.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and perused the records.\n\n6. As regards the first contention raised by the petitioner inasmuch as the non-applicability of Section 138 of the Act to the settlement proceedings cannot be countenanced for the reason that Ex.P11 is an agreement entered into between the parties on 16.6.2006 which reads thus:\" WHEREAS the First Party has initiated the proceedings under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. against the Second Party in C.C.No.687/2005 on the file of the Honourable Judicial Magistrate, I Class (III Court), Mysore. Now, in view of the inability on the part of the Second Party to pay the actual due amount, on the request of the Second Party, the First Party has agreed to grant time for payment of the due amount by making certain arrangements for payment of the amount in installments, by getting the criminal complaint dismissed as settled.\n\n1. The Second Party has agreed to pay total sum of Rs. 1,06,000/- [Rupees One Lakh Sixty Thousand Only] to the First Party in Full and Final settlement of the claim of the First Party against the Second Party.\n\n2. The First Party has agreed to receive the same in Full Settlement of his claim pertaining to the cheque bearing No.001172 dated 24.04.2004 drawn in Uppinangadi Agricultural Co-Operative Bank Limited, Uppinangadi.\n\n3. The Second Party has paid a sum of Rs. 10,000/- [Rupees Ten Thousand Only] in cash on the date of this Agreement to the First Party. The First Party reports the receipt of the said sum of Rs. 10,000/- [Rupees Ten Thousand Only].\n\n4. The Second Party shall pay the balance of Rs. 1,50,000/- [Rupees One Lakh Fifty Thousand Only] in daily installments of Rs. 500/- [Rupees Five Hundred Only]. The said amount shall be directly to be remitted to the account of the First Party to the Bank account of the First Party daily by the Second Party to any of the Bank account of the First Party in Uppinangadi Town and it is commencing from 19.06.2006.\n\n5. If the amount is remitted daily till the clearance of Rs. 1,50,000/- then the entire claim of the First Party against the Second Party will be settled. If for any reason if the Second Party commits default for continuous period of one week in remitting the amount as agreed above, the First Party is entitled to enforce the balance of due amount as agreed above. The Second Party has issued two cheques each for Rs. 75,000/- drawn in the name of the First Party bearing No.029714 and 029715 of Syndicate Bank, Uppinangadi. If the Second Party commits default in payment of amount for continuous period of one week, the First Party is entitled to present the said cheque and realized the amount due referred above.\n\n6. On clearance of the entire amount in daily installments, the First Party shall return the cheques now handed over to the First Party by the Second Party. The Second Party is also entitled to clear the entire amount at once if the Second Party intends to do so before clearance of the due amount in daily installments. In such case also, the First Party shall return the cheques.\n\n7. The First and Second Party shall get the criminal case closed by filing Joint Memo.\"A reading of this agreement makes it clear that the second party - accused has agreed to pay a total sum of Rs. 1,60,000/- to the first party in full and final settlement of the claim of the 1st party (complainant) against the second party towards the balance amount of Rs. 1,50,000/-. The parties have agreed that Rs. 500/- shall be directly remitted to the account of the complainant on daily basis and in the event the accused committing default in payment of amount for continuous period of one week, the complainant is entitled to present the two cheques and realize the amount due, referred to therein.Though the learned counsel for the petitioner made an endeavour to consider this agreement as a settlement deed between the parties which do not create any legally enforceable right on the complainant to collect the same as a debt, but it is not in dispute that the original cheque bearing No.001172 dated 24.1.2004 drawn in Uppinangadi Agricultural Cooperative Bank, Uppinangadi was towards the loan amount raised by the accused for his business purposes. n the earlier criminal proceedings CC No.687/2005 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate First Class-III at Mysore, the complaint came to be dismissed as settled. Two cheques bearing No.029714 and 029715 for Rs. 75,000/- each drawn on Syndicate Bank, Uppinangadi Branch were issued by the accused in terms of the agreement dated 16.6.2006. The issuance of these cheques cannot be considered as not legally enforceable debt. Section 138 of the Act is attracted in the following circumstances:\n\n(i) that there is legally enforceable debt;\n\n(ii) that the cheque was drawn from the account of of the accused and deposited by the complainant;\n\n(iii) that the cheque so issued had returned due to insufficiency of funds.The parameters set out in Section 138 of the Act if satisfied, the proceedings of the courts below cannot be held to be irregular or perverse. To examine the same, the agreement entered into between the parties and the cheques issued by the accused has been carefully examined. It is manifest that in order to discharge the legally enforceable debt, the settlement was agreed upon culminating in the issue of two cheques. Thus, provisions of Section 138 of the Act is squarely applicable to the facts of the present case. In the case of Lalit Kumar and another (supra), the second cheque was issued by one Mr.Manish Arora for the purpose of arriving at a settlement not to discharge the debt or liability of the company of which the appellants therein were said to be the Directors. In the said case, the Directors of the company had suffered an order of conviction sentence as the complaint/petition had not been withdrawn. In that context, the issuance of the second cheque was held to be not to discharge the debt or liability of the company. However, in the present case, the accused was not convicted/punished in the first criminal proceedings and the same came to be dismissed as settled before passing of any order. The second cheque issued by the accused came to be dishonoured which compelled the complainant to proceed with Section 138 and 139 of the Act. Both the courts below having appreciated the evidence on record had rightly come to a conclusion that the complainant has proved the offence committed by the accused beyond any reasonable doubt.. The next argument advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner that cheques were issued as security and not towards discharge of any debt in terms of the agreement-Ex.P11, also do not inspire any confidence. The primary object of issuing two cheques in question is to discharge the debt. Settlement was entered into between the parties for the accused to make payment, on daily basis, at the rate of 500/- per day, in the event of default on the part of the accused in not making the payment for a week, the complainant is at liberty to present the cheques for encashment. This condition in the agreement would not come to the assistance of the accused to take the defence of security.The agreement Ex.D11 would only permit the complainant to realise the cheques if default is committed by the accused in discharging the liability as agreed. Postponing of presenting the cheques to the Bank for encashment would not partake the character of security. Hence, the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner deserves to be negated.

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThough this matter is listed for Admission, with the consent of learned counsel from both side, the same is heard finally.  The complaint of the present appellant filed in the Court of the XX Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru City (hereinafter referred to as the \"Trial Court\" for the sake of brevity), resulted in acquittal of the accused/respondent by the trial Court by its judgment dated 21.07.2015. Challenging the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.  It is the summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court that the accused was his student, as such, the accused is a person known to him. It is in this context the complainant lent him a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/- in the month of July-2012, on the condition that the accused should repay the same within two months thereafter. However, the accused failed to repay the said amount at the demand made by the complainant.  The accused issued him a cheque dated 01.10.2012, for a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/-, in the last month of September 2012. When the same was presented for realisation, it returned dishonoured with an endorsement that \"account closed\". According to the complainant, thereafter, he issued a statutory notice to the accused and the same came to be returned un-served. Thereafter, the complainant filed a complaint under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Cr.P.C.\" for the sake of brevity) against the accused in the trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the \"N.I. Act\" for the sake of brevity). For the sake of convenience, the parties would be referred to as per their ranks before the trial Court. The accused appeared and contested the matter.  In order to prove his case, the complainant got himself examined as PW.1 and got marked documents as per Exs.P-1 to 7. The accused got himself examined as DW.1 and got marked documents as per Exs.D-1 to 12.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel for the appellant while reiterating the contention of the appellant taken in the Memorandum of Appeal submitted that the trial Court has erred in not giving the benefit of presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act in favour of the appellant. He also submitted that the trial Court also lost sight of the fact that the parties were known to each other and the appellant who had surplus fund after selling his house property lent a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/- to the accused.  According to the complainant, the occasion to lend money to the accused arose to him only for the reason that the accused was his student. It is for the said reason when the accused is said to have approached him for financial assistance in the month of July-2012, he gave him a hand loan of Rs. 1,15,000/-, towards repayment of which, the accused gave him the cheque in question. The complainant in his evidence as PW.1, has reiterated the said contention. However, in his cross-examination when specific questions were put from the side of the accused as to in which year and in which school the accused was his student, the complainant could only say that the accused was his student in Siddaganga Mutt High School.  However, he has stated that he does not remember as to which year the accused was his student. A specific suggestion was made to the complainant in his cross-examination to the effect that the accused has never been his student and that he has not studied in Siddaganga Mutt, on the other hand, the accused has completed his High School at Sri. Basaveshwara High School at Kolala of Tumakuru District. In order to support the said contention of the accused that he was a student of Sri. Basaveshwara High School at Kolala of Tumakuru District, he has also produced the certified copy of his SSLC marks card at Ex.D-10, Certified copy of the character certificate at Ex.D-11 and certified copy of the cumulative record at Ex.D-12. Those documents remained undenied and they clearly show that the accused has completed his 10th standard in the year April-1980 from Sri. Basaveshwara High School, Kolala. Thus, the first statement of the complainant that the accused was a person known to him as his student in Siddaganga Mutt High School, has been falsified by the accused by leading not only rebuttal evidence, but also producing cogent documents and confronting the same in the cross-examination of PW.1.  It is the contention of the complainant that the accused has been a resident of Hanumanthagiri Village, Kolala Hobli, Koratagere Taluk, Tumakuru District, as such the legal notice as required under Section 138 of the N.I. Act was sent to him to the said address. The contention of the accused was that he is a permanent resident of Bengaluru, as such, the question of he residing at Hanumanthagiri Village, Kolala Hobli, Koratagere Taluk, Tumakuru District, does not arise. It is for the said reason, the legal notice at Ex.P-5 returned to the sender/complainant without its service upon the addressee. It is in that regard, apart from making suggestions to the complainant in his cross-examination as PW.1, the accused has also produced certain documents showing his address proof at Bengaluru and those documents include the certified copy of the rental agreement at Ex.D-1, certified copy of the gas connection application at Ex.D-2, certified copy of bank pas books at Exs.D-3 and 4, certified copies of the school identity cards of the daughters of the accused at Exs.D-5 and 6, so also their marks cards at Exs.D-7 and 8.  The accused has also produced the certified copy of his EPIC card at Ex.D-9. All these documents clearly go to show that the accused is not the resident of Hanumanthagiri Village, Kolala Hobli, Koratagere Taluk, Tumakuru District, but he is a resident of Kamakshipalya, Bengaluru and Basaveshwara Nagar, Bengaluru and those documents produced by the accused clearly establishes that all those documents reveal the address at Bengaluru as that of the place of residence of both accused and his school going daughters. When this aspect was put in the mouth of the complainant in his cross-examination, the complainant as PW.1 has stated that since the mother of the accused was at Kolala, he presumed that the accused was residing there and as such, notice was sent to that address. The complainant has not denied the place of residence or the address of the accused at Bengaluru. However, based upon certain assumptions made by him, the complainant has sent notice to such an address which was not the address or the place of residence of the accused, as such, the notice at Ex.P-5 has been returned un-served. Thus, there is non-compliance of service of statutory notice, which service of notice is mandatory as provided under Section 138(b) of the N.I. Act.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent/accused in his argument submitted that the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption existing in favour of the appellant. The accused could able to establish that the complainant was a stranger to him and that under no circumstance, the cheque in question was issued to him by the accused bilaterally.  The cheque issued to one Smt. Meenakshamma as security to the loan, was misused by filling the contents by the complainant. He also submitted that the accused has proven his case to the effect that he was not at all a resident of the address to which the notice has been sent by the complainant. As such, there is no compliance of the statutory requirement of service of notice upon the accused before filing the complaint.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n After hearing both side, the trial Court by its judgment dated 21.07.2015, acquitted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. It is against the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Section 139 of the N.I. Act makes out a presumption in favour of the payee/holder of the cheque. Unless and until the accused rebuts in a process known to law, the presumption that the cheque was issued in favour of the payee for a legally enforceable debt or liability, would be presumed under law. In the instant case even after keeping the said presumption under consideration in favour of the complainant, when the materials placed before this Court are analysed, the following points can be noticed:The accused in the cross-examination of PW.1 has also raised a doubt about the availability of the fund or the source of fund with the complainant to lend loan of Rs. 1,15,000/-. It is in that connection that the complainant has stated that in the month of March-2012, he had sold his house property for a sum of Rs. 5,50,000/- and has retained the sale proceeds in his bank account. It is to lend money to the accused he has withdrawn a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/-, fifteen days prior to the said loan transaction from the said bank. The complainant as PW.1 has also stated that he could able to produce the bank statement for having drawn such amount from his bank account. However, despite making such statement when there was a specific suggestion that there was no source of fund for the complainant to lend money, the complainant has not produced any of the bank account details to show that there was sufficient fund in his bank account by which he has withdrawn Rs. 1,15,000/-, which he has contended in the cross-examination.

The summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court is that himself and the respondent are friends. The respondent approached him for hand loan of a sum of Rs. 1 lakh in September 2006 and obtained the said loan from him promising to repay the same within six months thereafter. The respondent also gave him a cheque on 5.2.2007, bearing No.409791, for Rs. 1 lakh. On presentation, the cheque came to be dishonoured for want of funds.  A legal notice as required under Section 138 of N.I.Act was also issued to the respondent demanding repayment of the amount. Since the respondent failed to meet the demand made under the notice, the complainant filed a private complaint against him under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act, which came to be numbered as C.C.No.28351/2007.  The complainant in support of his case before the trial Court got examined himself as PW-1 and got marked documents at Exs.P-1 to P-12, which includes the alleged returned cheque, legal notice and postal receipt. On the other hand, the accused got himself examined as DW-1 and got marked a copy of the reply said to have been given by him to the notice sent by the complainant and a postal acknowledgement.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The trial Court after recording the evidence led by both side and hearing both side, by its impugned judgment of acquittal dated 30.3.2010, acquitted the respondent/accused of the alleged offence. It is against the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the appellant in her arguments, while reiterating the contention taken up by the appellant in his memorandum of appeal, submitted that when admittedly the issuance of cheque by the respondent/accused in favour of the complainant has come on record and the defence taken by the accused was not tenable, the trial Court was erred in passing a judgment of acquittal only for the reason that the alleged loan was not reflected in the Income-tax Return of the complainant and also by finding that there was no presumption to be made in favour of the complainant.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/accused in his brief arguments submitted 2. that it is unbelievable that the complainant if at all had lent a sum of Rs. 1 lakh to the accused, failed to collect any other document, like the Promissory Note, evidencing the alleged loan. He further submitted that such a huge amount was paid in cash but not through any negotiable instrument is also not believable. It is for the said reason, the trial Court has rightly pronounced the judgment of acquittal.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: From the reading of the evidence of both side, it is clear that the acquaintance between the parties is not in dispute. Both of them have admitted that they know each other. It has also come in the evidence of PW-1 and in the cross-examination of PW-1 that he is doing the work of construction of building and sale of building and is also an Income-tax assessee, whereas, DW-1 is shown to be running two Xerox shops. The complainant as PW-1 has stated that he does not remember the date when accused approached him for loan, but, has stated that, it was in September 2006. According to him, the loan was paid in cash. Admittedly, the complainant is an Income-tax assessee. The accused in the form a suggestion made to PW-1, has suggested that it was the complainant who approached him in the month of February 2007, requesting for a hand loan, for which, the accused gave him a cheque as per Ex.P-1. However, since he could not pool up the funds to honour the cheque, the same was returned. The complainant has not admitted those suggestions as true. On the other hand, from the side of the complainant, in the cross-examination of DW-1, it has been suggested that the accused did not have the sufficient amount in his account when he issued the cheque at Ex.P-1.  The accused as DW-1 has also stated in his cross-examination that after the dishonour of the cheque at Ex.P-1 or after receiving the notice, he has neither asked the complainant for returning of the said cheque nor given any police complaint in that regard. The accused has also stated that he has not given notice to the complainant asking him to return the cheque. To the height of which, the accused has also admitted a suggestion as true that he was having financial crisis in September 2006. He further admitted a suggestion as true that there are two other criminal cases pending against him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. It is in the light of the above admissions made by both side in their cross-examination and the evidence led by them, the case has to be looked into. Section 139 of the N.I.Act lays down a presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque. As per the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Rangappa -vs- Sri Mohan {2010 (11) SCC 441}, when once the issuance of cheque from the drawer of the instrument in favour of the payee is proved, there would be a legal presumption as to the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability towards the payee of the cheque, who is the complainant herein.  However, the said presumption is rebuttable. As such, in the instant case, when the accused as DW-1 himself has categorically admitted that he had issued the cheque at Ex.P-1 to the complainant and also has admitted his signature in the said instrument, there comes into a presumption in favour of the complainant with regard to the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability from the drawer of the instrument towards the complainant. However, the said presumption is rebuttable. The accused in order to rebut the said presumption, has taken a defence in his side that it was the complainant himself who had requested for a loan of Rs. 1 lakh from him. It is in that regard, a cheque for Rs. 1 lakh, which is at Ex.P-1, was given to him. The said defence was taken in the form of a mere suggestion made to PW-1 in his cross-examination. However, the said suggestion has not been admitted as true by PW-1.  Thus, the defence of the accused is confined only to a suggestion made to the other side witness. When the accused is expecting some more document other than mere cheque from the complainant to establish that he had lent a sum of Rs. 1 lakh the same analogy would apply even to the accused also. By applying which, it can be seen that even the accused who claims to have agreed to lend a sum of Rs. 1 lakh and said to have issued a cheque to the complainant as per Ex.P-1, has not collected any other document, including a Promissory Note or an Agreement or a chit, to show that it was a loan extended by the accused to the complainant. Therefore, in the absence of any corroborative material or evidence, the mere statement made by the accused that the said cheque was given by him to the complainant as a loan is difficult to believe. It is also for the reason that, as admitted by the accused himself as DW-1 that during the period of September 2006, which according to the complainant is the month when he extended hand loan to the accused, the accused was in financial crises. Thus, a person who is in financial crises and is running only two Xerox shops and is also facing two similar criminal cases for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act, makes it difficult to believe in the circumstances of the case that he was in a position to lend Rs. 1 lakh to the complainant. On the other hand, admittedly the complainant is a constructor and vendor of buildings, that means, he was involved in the development of buildings and sale of it and he was also an Income-tax assessee.  Thus, the presumption which has already existed in favour of the complainant, could not be rebutted by the accused though he has led his evidence. This aspect, the trial Court, did not appreciate in its proper perspective. It carried away by a mere notion that the complainant being an Income-tax assessee, has not reflected the said loan transaction in his Income-tax return. The trial Court was not satisfied by itself as to under which provision of Income-tax Act, an assessee is required to declare each and every aspect of his loan transaction to the Assessing Authority. No such details have been elicited in the cross-examination of PW-1 also. In that scenario, merely because the complainant was an Income-tax assessee, jumping into a conclusion that since the alleged hand loan was not reflected in his Income-tax return would stand as a rebuttable presumption in his favour, is not required to be considered as a sound reasoning.  Thus, the entire judgment of the trial Court being on the said point of non-declaration of the alleged transaction in the Income-tax return of the complainant and as such, arriving at a conclusion that there was no ground for presumption, it has to be said that the said finding of the trail Court was erroneous.  On the other hand, as observed above, the admitted fact that the cheque at Ex.P-1 was issued by the accused to the complainant and the fact of dishonour of the said cheque for insufficiency of funds when presented for realisation, would entitle the complainant for a presumption under Section 139 of the N.I.Act in his favour. A mere suggestion made by the accused in the cross-examination of PW-1 and a statement made by the accused as DW-1 in his examination-in-chief to the effect that the said cheque in question was given by him as a loan to the complainant could not be proved for the reasons analysed above.\n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThis appeal is preferred by the complainant being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 1.3.2013 passed by the XIII ACMM Court, Bengaluru, in C.C. No.12053/2009. By the said judgment, the respondent-accused is acquitted of the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'the N.I. Act').  Brief facts of the case of the appellant-complainant before the learned Magistrate is that The respondent had executed an agreement to sell his house property bearing No.1229, 1st Stage, 1st Phase, BTM Layout, Bangalore (Ward No.65), dated 09.12.2004 in favour of the appellant. The said agreement was registered. The agreed total sale consideration was Rs. 70.00 Lakhs. Out of the said amount, the respondent received Rs. 25.00 lakhs by cheque and the balance amount in cash, on different dates.  The appellant submits that, the above said agreement to sell was cancelled by agreement dt.22.03.2005 which is also registered. In the said agreement of cancellation, it is stated that, a cheque bearing No.653704 drawn on Bank of Baroda, John Nagar Branch, Bangalore - 560 034, dt.22.03.2005, for Rs. 30 lakhs is given towards the repayment of part of the sale consideration. However, the said cheque was in fact not given to the appellant, but used by the respondent himself, which is clear from the statement of account of the bank account of the respondent marked as Ex.P.11. Cheque bearing No.00653704 of the value of Rs. 10,090/- is debited from the account on 25.04.2005.  Thus, no part of the sale consideration of Rs. 70.00 lakhs was refunded. It is further stated by the appellant that, he was persisting the respondent for payment through his general power of attorney holder, who is his brother. The general power of attorney holder was also insisting the respondent to pay the amount. The respondent paid a sum of Rs. 10.00 lakhs by a Banker's cheque dt.16.08.2006 bearing No.230908 of Bank of Baroda, John Nagar, Bangalore-560 034, favouring the appellant-complainant. Apart from the above said amount of Rs. 10.00 lakhs, the respondent has not paid any amount out of Rs. 70.00 lakhs. As such, the respondent was due in a sum of Rs. 60.00 lakhs to the appellant. It is further stated by the appellant that, through his general power of attorney holder, he was constantly pursuing the respondent to pay the balance amount of Rs. 60.00 lakhs. In this regard, the respondent issued two cheques bearing No.653705 dt.09.12.2008 drawn on Bank of Baroda, John Nagar, Bangalore - 560 034 for a sum of Rs. 30.00 lakhs and another cheque bearing No.121708 dt.18.10.2008, drawn on Sree Charan Souharda Co-Operative Bank Ltd., H.B.Samaja Road, Basavangudi, Bangalore - 560 004 for a sum of Rs. 30.00 lakhs towards the discharge of the above said obligation to repay.  This appeal is with regard to the dishonor of the cheque of Bank of Baroda. The appellant has filed another appeal with regard to the cheque of Sree Charan Souharda Co-Operative Bank Ltd., which was the subject matter of CC No.12052/2009. The appellant has further stated that, his power of attorney holder, Shri Shivanna D. Hulgur was informed by the respondent to present the cheques on or after 05.02.2009. Accordingly, the appellant presented the above said cheques for encashment through the his banker on 06.02.2009. The above said cheque of Bank of Baroda is returned by the bankers of the accused, dishonored on the ground of insufficiency of funds in the account of the respondent on 06.02.2009 itself. The intimation of the return of the cheque was given to the appellant on 06.02.2009. The appellant caused issuance of a legal notice dated 16.02.2009 to the respondent calling upon him to make payment of the cheque amount of Rs. 30.00 Lakhs within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice. The said legal notice was dispatched through RPAD on 16.02.2009, which was delivered on 19.02.2009. Though the notice was served on the respondent on 19.02.2009, the respondent did not either pay the cheque amount of Rs. 30.00 lakhs nor did he reply to the legal notice.  The appellant filed PCR No.6869/2009 on 28.03.2009. The counsel for the appellant-complainant received an untenable reply dated 28.3.2009 on 31.03.2009 to the legal notice dated 16.02.2009. Reply is issued beyond the statutory period. The sworn statement of the power of attorney holder of the appellant was recorded on 01.06.2009 and the case was numbered as CC No.12053/2009. The power of attorney holder of the appellant gave evidence as P.W.1 by filing affidavit of evidence on 25.01.2010 and Exs.P.1 to P.10 were marked on 26.02.2010. Subsequently on 23.04.2010, Exs.P.11 to P.12 were also marked. P.W.1 was cross examined by the counsel for the respondent/accused on 29.06.2010, 31.08.2010 and 13.10.2010. The statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded. On the respondent-accused submitting that he has no defense evidence, case was posted for arguments on 20.11.2010. Being aggrieved by the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the learned Magistrate and also challenging the legality and correctness of the said judgment and order on the grounds as mentioned in the appeal memorandum at ground Nos.18 to 49, the appellant-complainant is before this Court in this appeal.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel for the appellant-complainant submitted that so far as the aspect of limitation is concerned, though the agreement of sale was cancelled in the year 2005, the accused made payment of Rs. 10.00 lakhs by issuing cheque, in the year 2006. Subsequently, the two cheques issued for Rs. 30.00 lakhs each also came to be dishonoured on 6.2.2009 for want of sufficiency of funds in the account of the accused. Hence, he submitted that the complaint is within the limitation period. The learned counsel submitted that so far as accepting the liability and issuance of cheque is concerned, the learned Magistrate relied upon the judgment of Krishna Janardhana Bhat -Vs- Dattatraya G. Hegde reported in (2008) 4 SCC 54 and held that no such presumption is available to the complainant and the entire burden is on the complainant to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt.  The learned counsel also submitted that subsequent to the decision of Krishna Janardhana Bhat, there is judgment of the Full Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Rangappa Vs. Sri Mohan reported in (2010) 11 SCC 441. Hence, in view of the said judgment, there is presumption regarding the acceptance of liability and that the cheque in question is said to have been issued in discharge of the said liability. Regarding the power of attorney is concerned, the learned counsel for the appellant made submission that the power of attorney holder is the person having the personal knowledge about the transaction in between the complainant and the accused person.  The agreement of sale as well as the cancellation of agreement of sale were made in the presence of power of attorney holder and hence he is having the locus standi to file the complaint on behalf of the complainant. Regarding the cash payment of Rs. 40.00 lakhs in the house of accused for which he has obtained signature of the accused is concerned, the learned counsel submitted that if at all the respondent-accused has not received Rs. 40.00 lakhs, then there was no reason for him to issue two cheques for Rs. 30.00 lakhs each.  This aspect is not taken into consideration by the learned Magistrate. Looking to these materials, they clearly go to show that there was payment of the amount of Rs. 70.00 lakhs in all, out of which, the amount of Rs. 10.00 lakhs only was repaid by the respondent-accused and he was due to pay the sum of Rs. 60.00 lakhs for which he issued two cheques. The learned Magistrate has wrongly read the evidence and has wrongly come to the conclusion in holding that the appellant complainant has failed to prove his case beyond all reasonable doubt and acquitted the respondent-accused. Hence, the judgment and order of acquittal is illegal. Therefore, the appeal be allowed and the judgment and order be set aside by convicting the respondent-accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nPer contra, learned counsel for respondent-accused submitted that the agreement was cancelled in the year 2005 and the complaint came to be filed in the year 2009 which was after four years of the deed of cancellation. Therefore, the complaint is barred by the law of limitation.  Regarding the status for the power of attorney holder to file the complaint on behalf of the complainant is concerned, he is not having the power or authority to file the complaint on behalf of the complainant in respect of the criminal cases. In this regard, he relied upon the decision of A.C.Narayanan -vs- State of Maharashtra and another with G.Kamalakar -vs- Surana Securities Limited and another reported in (2014) 11 SCC 790. It is also his submission that the respondent-accused never transacted with the complainant, the accused does not know about the complainant and he transacted only with the power of attorney holder.  When the agreement of sale came to be cancelled by the registered deed, before the cancellation order the Sub Registrar made statement that for the purpose of income tax, the amount is to be paid and in this regard cheque needs to be issued. Therefore, for the purpose of facilitating registration of cancellation agreement, the cheque was issued in the name of the complainant for the sum of Rs. 30.00 lakhs. When the document was cancelled and its registration was completed, the power of attorney holder returned back the cheque to the accused person. The complainant was not at all in picture at the said time or place. Therefore, the question of the respondent accused issuing the cheque in the name of the complainant does not arise. It is also the submission of the learned counsel that if at all it is the contention of the complainant that he paid Rs. 40.00 lakhs in cash in the residence of the accused and obtained receipt in that regard and the entire consideration amount is paid, then why the complainant has not insisted the accused to execute a registered sale deed and why there was cancellation of the agreement of sale. Regarding the payment of Rs. 40.00 lakhs in the house of the accused person is concerned, absolutely there is no document to support the said contention. Therefore, the learned Magistrate has rightly appreciated this aspect and rightly came to be conclusion that there is no material placed by the complainant in proof of the payment of Rs. 40.00 lakhs to the accused in his house. Referring to the contents of the power of attorney and cancellation agreement, the learned counsel also submitted that whatever the amount is mentioned in the said documents, it is by way of loan in respect of the earlier transaction and as a security for the said repayment of the loan amount, the document came to be executed. In reality, there was no such transaction of agreement of sale as contended by the complainant.  Hence, he submitted that looking to these materials, the learned Magistrate has rightly appreciated the entire materials and rightly came to the conclusion that the complainant has failed to make out his case and failed to prove that there is offence committed by the respondent-accused under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. Drawing the attention of this Court towards the copy of the complaint (Ex.D.8), he submitted that this aspect is also taken into consideration while appreciating the case of the complainant. The learned counsel further submitted that power of attorney holder gave cheque to one Mohan which was realized for the amount of Rs. 30.00 lakhs. Hence, if this material is appreciated, then the same falsifies the case of the complainant that he has paid the amount of Rs. 70.00 lakhs and the accused made the payment of Rs. 10.00 lakhs by way of cheque on 16.8.2008. Hence, he submitted that the learned Magistrate has correctly appreciated the entire materials and rightly came to the conclusion in acquitting the respondent-accused. Hence, the learned counsel submitted to dismiss the appeal with costs. With regard to the aspect of limitation, learned Counsel for the respondent-accused has raised the contention that the agreement was cancelled in the year 2005 by way of registered cancellation of agreement and the complaint came to be filed in the year 2009. Therefore, as per Section 468(2) of Cr.P.C., the complaint is barred by law of limitation. Therefore, on this ground as well, the complaint ought to have been rejected by the learned Magistrate. The contention of the complainant is that though the agreement of sale was cancelled by the registered cancellation deed, the accused had made the payment of Rs. 10.00 lakhs on 16.08.2006.  It is also his contention that two other cheques for Rs. 30.00 lakhs each were issued subsequently making a request to the complainant to present the same on the date as mentioned by the respondent-accused. As far as presentation of the cheques are concerned, it was presented on 06.02.2009, whereas the date given by the accused to present the cheques were on or before 05.02.2009.  If this date is taken into consideration and the part payment of Rs. 10.00 lakhs by a banker's cheque, which is the admitted fact even according to the respondent-accused under the cheque bearing No.230908 of Bank of Baroda, John Nagar Branch, Bengaluru, this part payment makes out the acknowledgment of debt and subsequent issuance of two cheques and their presentation on 06.02.2009 and immediately thereafter the issuance of legal notice to the accused person and filing of the complaint, they are all within the law of limitation. Therefore, the contention of the accused that the claim of the complainant is barred by the law of limitation cannot be accepted. The material itself clearly goes to show that the complainant has taken necessary steps to file the complaint within the prescribed time. Hence, the contention of the respondent-accused regarding the bar of limitation is not accepted by this Court. Though it is contended by learned Counsel for the respondent-accused that the accused never transacted with the complainant and that he transacted with the power of attorney holder of the complainant as there was loan transaction between the two concerned, I have perused the cheque issued. \nRuling by the Lower Court:\n3. Then the learned Magistrate heard the arguments of both sides and after considering the materials placed before him, both oral and documentary, acquitted the respondent-accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and bail bond of the accused was cancelled. \n",
    "Case_Result": "Heard the arguments of learned counsel appearing for the appellant-complainant and also the arguments of learned counsel for the respondent-accused. I have perused the grounds urged in the appeal memorandum, judgment and order of acquittal passed by the learned Magistrate, oral evidence on the side of the complainant, the documents produced and the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for both sides, which are referred above. I have also considered the oral submissions made by learned counsel for both sides made at the Bar.The cheque is issued in the name of the complainant and not in the name of power of attorney holder. If the transaction is made directly with the power of attorney holder, then nothing prevented the respondent-accused to issue cheque in the name of the power of attorney holder itself and the same is not done in this case. The accused admitted the signature on the cheque and the issuance of cheque. When that is so, the presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act arises in this case and it is for the respondent-accused to rebut the said presumption.Looking to the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court, taking some defence is not the rebuttal of presumption but the accused has to place some materials which is worth believable to rebut the presumption. Then only it can be said that there is rebuttal of the presumption on the part of the accused. In this case, the accused has not been examined himself as the defence witness. He has not entered into the witness box. Even looking to the cross-examination of the power of attorney holder of the complainant, there is no such cross examination so as to disbelieve the case of the complainant about the advancement of the amount of Rs. 70.00 lakhs out of which only Rs. 10.00 lakhs is paid by way of issuing the cheque and the remaining amount of Rs. 60.00 lakhs is unpaid and same is the due amount. There was no reason for the accused to issue two cheques in the name of the complainant for the sum of Rs. 30.00 lakhs each. Therefore, the respondent-accused has failed to make out his defence with worth believable material. So far as the status of the power of attorney holder to file the complaint and to give his evidence on behalf of the complainant is concerned, though it is contended by the respondent-accused that in the criminal procedure code, there is no provision that the power of attorney holder can file the complaint on behalf of the complainant. I have perused the decisions relied upon by the appellant-complainant wherein it is observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court that the cases under Section 138 of N.I. Act are civil in nature. It is also observed by the Hon'ble Apex Court that the power of attorney holder is authorised and competent person to present the complaint on behalf of his master under Section 138 of N.I. Act. Therefore, in view of the legal proposition it is clear that the power of attorney holder must have personal knowledge about the transaction. Looking to the materials placed on record in this case, it is the power of attorney holder who entered into the agreement of sale on behalf of the complainant and it is he, who entered into the cancellation of agreement on behalf of the complainant. Therefore, these are the acts done by the power of attorney holder on behalf of the complainant and he is having the personal knowledge of the said transaction which he has deposed before the Court. Therefore, the contention that the power of attorney holder has no status to file complaint on behalf of the complainant cannot be accepted at all. With regard to the Full Bench decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court, the learned counsel submitted that the proceedings under Section 138 of the N.I. Act are the criminal proceedings in nature. But looking to the principles enunciated in the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant-complainant and the learned counsel for the respondent-accused, I am of the opinion that it has been held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that the power of attorney holder can present the complaint on behalf of the complainant and he is the competent and the authorised person to do the same. Looking to the Full Bench decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court, the learned counsel for the appellant-complainant is justified in making the submission that when the cheque is in the name of the complainant and when it bears the signature of the respondent-accused, it is for the accused to explain as to why he issued the cheque in favour of the complainant even though he was not supposed to pay the due amount and even though he had not transacted with the complainant. Taking some defence is not the rebuttal of presumption but the accused has to place some material which is worth believable to rebut the presumption.With regard to payment of the amount of Rs. 70.00 lakhs is concerned, it is an admitted fact that Rs. 25.00 lakhs is paid by way of cheque and Rs. 5.00 lakhs by way of cash, totaling to Rs. 30.00 lakhs. In respect of the balance of Rs. 40.00 lakhs, it is the contention of the appellant-complainant that he paid Rs. 40.00 lakhs into the hands of the respondent-accused in his house and he obtained the receipt from the accused. The complainant has also led the oral evidence in this regard. However, the learned Magistrate has observed that since the amount of Rs. 40.00 lakhs is the huge amount, the complainant supposed to have obtained the receipts and produced the same before the Court. In the absence of such material and on the basis of the oral evidence of the complainant, he held that it cannot be accepted that the complainant has paid the amount of Rs. 40.00 lakhs into the hands of the accused. But the learned Magistrate has to appreciate the entire material in a proper perspective and to see what is the effect emerged out of the said material. As I have already observed that when the amount of Rs. 40.00 lakhs was not paid, there was no reason for the accused to issue cheques for Rs. 30.00 lakhs each and this aspect has not been properly considered and appreciated by the learned Magistrate. So far as the observation of the learned Magistrate concerned, the amount mentioned in the beginning of the agreement of sale is the amount borrowed by the accused from the power of attorney holder by way of loan and for repaying the said loan amount, the accused executed an agreement of sale. If the wordings of the agreement of sale and the deed of cancellation of agreement are properly considered and read, it is not the accused who borrowed the loan, but what is mentioned in the said document is that the purchaser borrowed the loan amount. Therefore, the observation made by the learned Magistrate in his judgment in respect of the this aspect is not the correct observation.Therefore, the contention of the respondent-accused that he borrowed loan from the power of attorney holder as a security and for the repayment of the said loan amount, he executed an agreement to the power of attorney holder and not to the complainant, the same cannot be accepted and it is not supported with worth believable material. Therefore, looking at the oral evidence of P.W.1 and D.W.1 and the documents produced by both sides, the judgment and order of acquittal passed is not in accordance with the materials placed on record. The entire evidence has been wrongly read by the learned Magistrate and he wrongly came to the conclusion in holding that the appellant-complainant has failed to prove his case beyond all reasonable doubt. Order accordingly",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe appellant has challenged the judgment of acquittal dated 30.3.2010, passed by the learned XVII Addl.Small Causes Judge & XXV Addl.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru, in C.C.No.28351/2007 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'trial Court'), acquitting the present respondent herein for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'N.I.Act'). The summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court is that himself and the respondent are friends. The respondent approached him for hand loan of a sum of Rs. 1 lakh in September 2006 and obtained the said loan from him promising to repay the same within six months thereafter. The respondent also gave him a cheque on 5.2.2007, bearing No.409791, for Rs. 1 lakh. On presentation, the cheque came to be dishonoured for want of funds.  A legal notice as required under Section 138 of N.I.Act was also issued to the respondent demanding repayment of the amount. Since the respondent failed to meet the demand made under the notice, the complainant filed a private complaint against him under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act, which came to be numbered as C.C.No.28351/2007.  The complainant in support of his case before the trial Court got examined himself as PW-1 and got marked documents at Exs.P-1 to P-12, which includes the alleged returned cheque, legal notice and postal receipt. On the other hand, the accused got himself examined as DW-1 and got marked a copy of the reply said to have been given by him to the notice sent by the complainant and a postal acknowledgement.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel for the appellant in her arguments, while reiterating the contention taken up by the appellant in his memorandum of appeal, submitted that when admittedly the issuance of cheque by the respondent/accused in favour of the complainant has come on record and the defence taken by the accused was not tenable, the trial Court was erred in passing a judgment of acquittal only for the reason that the alleged loan was not reflected in the Income-tax Return of the complainant and also by finding that there was no presumption to be made in favour of the complainant.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/accused in his brief arguments submitted 2. that it is unbelievable that the complainant if at all had lent a sum of Rs. 1 lakh to the accused, failed to collect any other document, like the Promissory Note, evidencing the alleged loan. He further submitted that such a huge amount was paid in cash but not through any negotiable instrument is also not believable. It is for the said reason, the trial Court has rightly pronounced the judgment of acquittal.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe trial Court after recording the evidence led by both side and hearing both side, by its impugned judgment of acquittal dated 30.3.2010, acquitted the respondent/accused of the alleged offence. It is against the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.\n",
    "Case_Result": "From the reading of the evidence of both side, it is clear that the acquaintance between the parties is not in dispute. Both of them have admitted that they know each other. It has also come in the evidence of PW-1 and in the cross-examination of PW-1 that he is doing the work of construction of building and sale of building and is also an Income-tax assessee, whereas, DW-1 is shown to be running two Xerox shops. The complainant as PW-1 has stated that he does not remember the date when accused approached him for loan, but, has stated that, it was in September 2006. According to him, the loan was paid in cash.Admittedly, the complainant is an Income-tax assessee. The accused in the form a suggestion made to PW-1, has suggested that it was the complainant who approached him in the month of February 2007, requesting for a hand loan, for which, the accused gave him a cheque as per Ex.P-1. However, since he could not pool up the funds to honour the cheque, the same was returned. The complainant has not admitted those suggestions as true. On the other hand, from the side of the complainant, in the cross-examination of DW-1, it has been suggested that the accused did not have the sufficient amount in his account when he issued the cheque at Ex.P-1. The accused as DW-1 has also stated in his cross-examination that after the dishonour of the cheque at Ex.P-1 or after receiving the notice, he has neither asked the complainant for returning of the said cheque nor given any police complaint in that regard. The accused has also stated that he has not given notice to the complainant asking him to return the cheque. To the height of which, the accused has also admitted a suggestion as true that he was having financial crisis in September 2006. He further admitted a suggestion as true that there are two other criminal cases pending against him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. It is in the light of the above admissions made by both side in their cross-examination and the evidence led by them, the case has to be looked into.Section 139 of the N.I.Act lays down a presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque. As per the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Rangappa -vs- Sri Mohan {2010 (11) SCC 441}, when once the issuance of cheque from the drawer of the instrument in favour of the payee is proved, there would be a legal presumption as to the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability towards the payee of the cheque, who is the complainant herein. However, the said presumption is rebuttable. As such, in the instant case, when the accused as DW-1 himself has categorically admitted that he had issued the cheque at Ex.P-1 to the complainant and also has admitted his signature in the said instrument, there comes into a presumption in favour of the complainant with regard to the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability from the drawer of the instrument towards the complainant. However, the said presumption is rebuttable.The accused in order to rebut the said presumption, has taken a defence in his side that it was the complainant himself who had requested for a loan of Rs. 1 lakh from him. It is in that regard, a cheque for Rs. 1 lakh, which is at Ex.P-1, was given to him. The said defence was taken in the form of a mere suggestion made to PW-1 in his cross-examination. However, the said suggestion has not been admitted as true by PW-1. Thus, the defence of the accused is confined only to a suggestion made to the other side witness. When the accused is expecting some more document other than mere cheque from the complainant to establish that he had lent a sum of Rs. 1 lakh the same analogy would apply even to the accused also. By applying which, it can be seen that even the accused who claims to have agreed to lend a sum of Rs. 1 lakh and said to have issued a cheque to the complainant as per Ex.P-1, has not collected any other document, including a Promissory Note or an Agreement or a chit, to show that it was a loan extended by the accused to the complainant. Therefore, in the absence of any corroborative material or evidence, the mere statement made by the accused that the said cheque was given by him to the complainant as a loan is difficult to believe.It is also for the reason that, as admitted by the accused himself as DW-1 that during the period of September 2006, which according to the complainant is the month when he extended hand loan to the accused, the accused was in financial crises. Thus, a person who is in financial crises and is running only two Xerox shops and is also facing two similar criminal cases for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act, makes it difficult to believe in the circumstances of the case that he was in a position to lend Rs. 1 lakh to the complainant. On the other hand, admittedly the complainant is a constructor and vendor of buildings, that means, he was involved in the development of buildings and sale of it and he was also an Income-tax assessee. Thus, the presumption which has already existed in favour of the complainant, could not be rebutted by the accused though he has led his evidence. This aspect, the trial Court, did not appreciate in its proper perspective. It carried away by a mere notion that the complainant being an Income-tax assessee, has not reflected the said loan transaction in his Income-tax return. The trial Court was not satisfied by itself as to under which provision of Income-tax Act, an assessee is required to declare each and every aspect of his loan transaction to the Assessing Authority. No such details have been elicited in the cross-examination of PW-1 also. In that scenario, merely because the complainant was an Income-tax assessee, jumping into a conclusion that since the alleged hand loan was not reflected in his Income-tax return would stand as a rebuttable presumption in his favour, is not required to be considered as a sound reasoning. Thus, the entire judgment of the trial Court being on the said point of non-declaration of the alleged transaction in the Income-tax return of the complainant and as such, arriving at a conclusion that there was no ground for presumption, it has to be said that the said finding of the trail Court was erroneous. On the other hand, as observed above, the admitted fact that the cheque at Ex.P-1 was issued by the accused to the complainant and the fact of dishonour of the said cheque for insufficiency of funds when presented for realisation, would entitle the complainant for a presumption under Section 139 of the N.I.Act in his favour. A mere suggestion made by the accused in the cross-examination of PW-1 and a statement made by the accused as DW-1 in his examination-in-chief to the effect that the said cheque in question was given by him as a loan to the complainant could not be proved for the reasons analysed above.

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case is whether the respondent, who issued a cheque for Rs. 1 lakh, was liable for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, after the cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds and a demand notice was issued by the complainant. The trial court acquitted the respondent, finding no presumption to be made in favour of the complainant and no loan being reflected in the Income-tax Return of the complainant.\n\nUpon analysis, the trial court erred in its judgment. The respondent's defence that the alleged loan was not reflected in the Income-tax Return of the complainant is not a valid defence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. The section does not require proof of the loan amount, but only the issuance of a cheque for payment of a debt or other liability.\n\nFurther, the trial court's finding that no presumption can be made in favour of the complainant is incorrect. Under Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, when a person is directed by a court to attend and give evidence or to produce a document or other thing in his possession or power, and he neglects to do so, the court may presume that he would have denied the existence of the document or the truth of the facts proved by the document, as the case may be.\n\nIn the present case, the complainant issued a legal notice demanding payment of the debt and the cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of funds. These facts satisfy the conditions under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. Consequently, a presumption arises that the accused had, at the time of the issue of the cheque, insufficient funds in his bank account to honour the cheque.\n\nHence, the appeal is allowed, and the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court is set aside. The respondent is found guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, and is sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 2,000, in default to undergo simple imprisonment for one month."

The facts in a capsulized form as presented in the memo of Appeal deserve reproduction herein below :\\n\\n:: Genesis of litigation :: 2.1 The appellant is the original complainant who chose to initiate prosecution for the dishonor of cheque on due completion of requisite mandatory requirements and preferred Criminal Case No.1373 of 2002 on 10.12.2002. It is the case of the complainant that he belongs to village Parbatpura, situated at Taluka Mansa, District Gandhinagar, whereas the respondent No.2 is the resident of village Jamda, District Taluka Kalol, District Gandhinagar. Since both the villages are at a distance of about two kilometers, the complainant shared fairly good acquaintance and relationship with the respondent-original accused. Brother-in-law of the complainant and the respondent No.2, worked as agents under one Development Officer Shri Kachrabhai Patel in L.I.C. Office; that is how the complainant had met the respondent No.2 and they had developed notable social relationship which had led to their entering into the said transaction. 3. It is the case of the prosecution as revealed in the complaint that the respondent had taken the complainant into confidence by impressing upon him that he had a big name in the office of L.I.C. He also had a side businesses of real estate and land; a process house in the name of S.B. Fabric. Under the pretext that he needed to initiate a business in partnership, he had shown the need of Rs. 36 lakh. While promising partnership to the appellant in the new business with equal percentage, he procured from the appellant a sum of Rs. 36 lakh. A promissory note was given in lieu of the amount parted by the complainant. Proceedings before the Trial Court::\\n\\n8. The in-charge learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate issued process on 10.12.2002. The respondent No.2 also moved an application for discharge below Exh.3 taking the defense that on the date of issuance of the cheque, the account of the respondent whether was operating or not, deserves to be established firstly. The request for discharge was made on 13.4.2004, which was rejected by the Court on 13.4.2004 itself. His case was numbered subsequently as Criminal Case No.590 of 2004, since the cases above the sum of Rs. 10 lakh were to be tried by the Court other than the Court which was conducting the matter.  Subsequently, when the Special Court was constituted to try the case under the N.I. Act, it was numbered being Criminal Case No.1829 of 2010 and once again thereafter, it was transferred to the Court No.2 and numbered as Criminal Case No.521 of 2011 on 28.4.2011. It was thereafter transferred to the Court conducting matters under the N.I. Act specially, being Court No.28, and the criminal case number remained the same i.e Criminal Case No.521 of 2017. After allowing the parties to adduce oral evidence as well as documentary evidence, the further statement of the accused on the evidence adduced came to be recorded where the defense raised in his further statement under section 313 of the Code, is that of denial of any legally enforceable debt. Considering incriminating oral as well as documentary evidence, the respondent was held guilty under section 138 of the N.I. Act and he had been convicted by the trial Court for a period of two years with simple imprisonment and fine of Rs. 5000/- and in default, four months of further simple imprisonment. . Firstly, at the outset, the question of law that deserves to be addressed is as to when the Appellate Court needs to interfere in the findings and conclusion of the trial Court and it is a trite law that if the view taken by the Appellate Court is a possible view with the evidence, oral and documentary, adduced in the matter, no interference is desirable by the Appellate Court.  Legally enforceable debt, whether proved (Issue No.2)::\\n\\n19. So far as the question of proving legally enforceable debt by the complainant is concerned, the law has been laid down by the three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Rangappa Versus Sri Mohan, reported in (2010) 11 SCC 441, wherein it is held that presumption mandated by Section 139 of the Act include the existence of legally enforceable debt or liability and this being a rebuttal presumption, of course, such presumption can be rebutted by the accused by raising the defence and on contesting liability. It, of course, is in the nature of a rebuttable presumption and it is open to the accused to raise a defence wherein the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability can be contested. However, what can be undoubtedly said is that there is an initial presumption that favours the complainant and Section 139 is an example of a reverse onus clause, which has been included in furtherance of the legitimate objection of improving the credibility of the negotiable instruments. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\n It is the grievance of the appellant that after obtaining this huge sum, the respondent had left his native and despite the best endeavors on the part of the appellant, his whereabouts were not found. When eventually he returned, on a persistent demand of the complainant, he had ensured to give the complainant a parcel of land situated at Ghuma, Tal. City and District Ahmedabad, bearing Survey Nos.506 and 507 with Block No.633 admeasuring 2-38 Gunntha and hector 1-19-38 H.A.G. He had also ensured to clear the bank dues for clearing the charge over the said land which was hypothecated with the bank for a huge sum lent to him by the Bank, within a period of six months. However, he failed to adhere to his words, therefore, it could not be come possible to carry out the Registered Sale Deed nor had the same made his debt cleared.  It is further the case of the appellant that for settling his outstanding dues, the cheque of Rs. 36lakh had been given by the respondent drawn of the State Bank of India, Girdharnagar Branch, Ahmedabad in favour of the appellant, bearing a cheque No.514147. He had been ensured by the respondent that the same would be honored. The cheque when presented on 30.10.2002, in the account of Kukarwada People's Co-operative Bank Limited, the same was dishonored on the ground of \"insufficient balance\" and returned to him with the memo of Bank on 1.11.2002. According to the appellant, an attempt when was made to contact the respondent, instead of being apologetic, he threatened him and also denied any possibility of his getting the amount.\\n\\n7. The appellant, therefore, issued a notice by way of Registered Post AD on 12.11.2002, through his advocate and another notice through U.P.C. was also sent. This came to be served upon the respondent on 13.11.2002, which has not even replied to. After allowing the statutory period to pass, the appellant decided to prefer the criminal complaint and initiated the prosecution under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (hereinafter referred to as 'N.I. Act').\nArgument by the Respondent:\n. Learned advocate Ms.S.M. Ahuja appearing with learned advocate Mr.Jitendra H. Singh, has made fervent submissions in respect of the alleged serious error and illegality committed by the Appellate Court, by taking this Court through the entire set of record and also by relying upon various decisions to substantiate the respective version of the complainant, which are as follows: 4. Learned advocate Mr. Baqui appearing with learned advocate Mr.Pathan also has strenuously and forcefully submitted that the punishment of two years has been prescribed by way of an amendment under section 138 of the N.I. Act with effect from 6.2.2003 and hence, it cannot be made applicable as this case has been registered in December, 2002 and substantive provision under the criminal prosecution cannot be made retrospectively effective. He has taken this Court through various depositions and other evidences to urge that the Appellate Court has rightly quashed and set aside the judgment and order of the trial Court by giving detailed judgment on each point. There will not be any requirement of the interference at the end of this Court. It is further his case that the appellant has failed to prove as to how he could give loan of huge amount i.e. Rs. 36 lakh to the present respondent. . Learned APP Mr. H.K. Patel appearing for the State has supported the case of the complainant to urge this Court that the appreciation of evidence shall have to be regarded thoroughly. It is the case were the Trial Court had convicted the respondent whereas the Appellate Forum has quashed and set aside such judgment and order.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nAppeal before the Court of Sessions ::\\n\\n11. Aggrieved respondent No.2 approached the Appellate forum against the judgment and order of conviction, by way of Criminal Appeal No.92 of 2015 read with Criminal Appeal No.486 of 2015 and the Court after elaborate discussion of the evidence quashed and set aside the judgment and order of learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Court No.28. The Court also directed the amount of fine and compensation to be refunded to the respondent herein. 1 The complainant had challenged the very decision seeking enhancement of compensation and the Court after hearing both the sides, disallowed the plea of the present Appellant (original complainant) while quashing and setting aside the judgment and order of learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. Aggrieved original complainant is before this Court as an appellant. After admission of this appeal, with the consent of both the sides, bearing in mind the year of transaction and initiation of prosecution, which was nearly before 16 years, this Court decided to hear final submissions of the learned advocates on both the sides and adjudicate the appeal.\n",
    "Case_Result": ":: Submissions of learned counsels of parties ::. This provision subject to the rule of evidence is applicable to the matters under the NI Act. The presumption made available is one of law and the Court is obliged to presume that the instrument has been endorsed for consideration. The initial burden, hence, lies on the person to prove that there exists legally enforceable debt and once that is proved by the Payee, it would be upon the other-side, i.e. the drawer, to prove non-existence of the consideration, which would lead the Court to believe either from direct evidence or from preponderance and probabilities that the existence of consideration was improbable, doubtful or illegal, as held by the Apex Court in 'MALLAVARAPU KASIVISWESWARA RAO VS. THADIKONDA RAMULU FIRM AND ORS', (2008) 7 SCC 655. Section 139 of the Act would also require reference at this stage. This is also a presumption, which is a rebuttable presumption when unless the accused proves to the contrary, this legal presumption of Section 139 of the NI Act is to the effect that the cheque is issued in discharge of an existing liability and that presumption can be rebutted only by the person, who drew the cheque. Section 139 of the NI Act reads as under:24. Thus, the presumption is in favour of the holder of the cheque, as held by the Apex Court in 'M/S.MANDVI CO-OP BANK LTD VS NIMESH B.THAKORE', (2010)3SCC83. Rebuttable presumption has emerged under Section 139 of the NI Act that the cheque was issued by the drawer in discharge of any debt or liability to its holder. Undoubtedly, the presumption available under Section 139 of the NI Act can be rebutted by the accused by adducing evidence and once the initial burden is discharged of proving the legally enforceable debt, it would be upon the accused to discharge that burden that there exists no debt or liability upon him.27. In wake of settled position of law as to how to appreciate the duly signed cheque in the hands of holder in due course or a drawee, on adverting to the facts of the instant case, the question needs to be addressed as to whether proof of existence of legally enforceable debt, could be established by the Appellant?28. In the examination-in-chief, the complainant has given all the details which have been specified in the complaint itself, which may not be required to be reiterated. The case of the prosecution, in sum and substance, as emerged in oral evidence is that an amount of Rs. 36 lakh had been advanced to the respondent which he needed for his business, which was to be set up and for which the complainant appellant was also offered partnership. When the respondent No.2 did not fulfill his promise, he firstly attempted to give back the amount by transferring a parcel of his land. A promissory note also was written by the respondent No.2 accused. However, on account of his not clearing the land from the bank where it was mortgaged, he issued the cheque which eventually got dishonored. The cheque issued by him was of State Bank of India, Girdharnagar Branch, Ahmedabad. However, due to 'insufficient opening balance', the same was returned as per the memo sent by the Bank.29. The factum of issuance of notice under section 138 of the N.I. Act, as is mandatory, prior to the lodgment of complaint has also come on record which is dated 12.11.2002. Respondent No.2 has chosen not to reply to the said notice nor has he paid back the amount pursuant to such notice and that paved a way for lodgment of complaint.30. In the exhaustive cross examination of the complainant, he maintained that his acquaintance with the respondent was through his brother-in-law Shri Pravinbhai Ambabhai Patel. In the year 1985-86, the respondent was also working under the Development Officer Shri Kachrabhai and so was the complainant. Thus, when both of them were working as L.I.C. agents, the relationship had strengthened. He agreed to the suggestion that the respondent was development officer of L.I.C. He denied the suggestion that insurance agent cannot transact any other business. He maintained that it was the business developed for his sons. In the year 2001, the respondent had met him at his resident being 3, Shimla Avenue, Near Navroji Hall, Dafnada, Shahibaug, and had confided in him that in the village Chanchadwadi, in the name and style of S.B. Process House, a family business was set up and the same was to be operated by his sons.31. The complainant himself was carrying on the business of Iron and Steel in the name and style of Ramkrishna Hardware and Sales, which was an independent business and which had a turn over of about Rs. 40 lakh. The profit in the business was to the tune of about 10%. He maintained his books of accounts. He and the respondent No.2 used to meet on a regular basis and that is how this sum of Rs. 36 lakh had been given to respondent No.2 on a promise on the part of the respondent No.2 to make the appellant a partner. He had advanced amount in the month of December, 2001. Since, the demand of the respondent No.2 was of cash, accordingly, it was managed. It is the case of the complainant that it was under the pretext of carrying out the partnership that he had asked for advanced sum of Rs. 36 lakh. He, of course, was unable to give exact dates of advancement of money, but according to him, periodically such amount had been given and a promissory note was issued by the respondent.32. The source of amount of Rs. 36 lakh has been questioned seriously by the learned advocate for the respondent, and a consistent reply of the complainant was that the same was earned from the agricultural income of his relatives. The complainant collected the said amount from various relatives, the details whereof are as under :-Sr.No.\tSource of fund from :\tAmount\n1\tHis agricultural income\tRs. 3.50 Lakh\n2\tHis maternal uncle (Masa) Madhabhai Ramanbhai\tRs. 4 Lakh\n3\tDashrathbhai Madhabhai (maternal cousins) (Masi's son)\tRs. 4 Lakh\n4\tRamanbhai Madhabhai Shankardas (Cousin brother)\tRs. 4 Lakh\n5\tDwarkadas Madhavlal Shankardas Patel (cousin and brother of Ramanbhai)\tRs. 3 Lakh\n6\tBhikhabhai Hathidas Patel @ Gandabhai Patel (paternal uncle) (who expired 18 months prior to his deposition)\tRs. 6.5 Lakh\n7\tNarandas Motidas Patel (paternal uncle) (fua)\tRs. 3 Lakh\n8\tAmbalal Vandas Patel (father of his daughter-in-law)\tRs. 5 Lakh\n9\tJanakbhai Babubhai Patel (son of his maternal uncle)\tRs. 3.5 Lakh\nTotal Amount\tRs. 36.50Lakh\n\n33. Thus, the details of names and amount of his collection of total sum of money advanced to the respondent, has been confirmed. This was borrowed by him with a promise to pay interest to those persons. To some of those relatives, he needed to pay the interest and to others, he had returned the principal amount. Respondent No.2 has three sons and the complainant had not inquired in detail in connection with their business of process house under the name and style of S.B. Fabric.34.1 The complainant also was unaware that the S.B. Fabric means Shantilal Bhudarlal Adani who was a father of Mr.Gautam Adani, the known businessman of the State. He also pleaded ignorance of this fabric house having been purchased by the respondent's son from Shri Shantilal Adani. He also pleaded ignorance that against the S.B. Fabric, the complaint came to be filed by various persons, which included the present respondent No.2 and his sons.34.2 This Court also notices that in the cross examination of the complainant, the reference comes of the respondent No.2 having agreed to transfer the portion of his immovable property being Survey No.506 and 507, Block No.633 situated at Taluka Ghuma, City Ahmedabad, admeasuring 2 acre 38 gunthas and hector 1-19-38 Hector-Are-Sq.Mtrs., which is nearly 14,278sq. yards. The half of the portion he had shown willingness to transfer in the name of three persons namely 1) Patel Baldevbhai Dahyabhai, President of Mansha 2) Patel Amrutbhai Narayandas, President of Charada and 3) Patel Jayantibhai Mafatlal i.e. present appellant, president of Parvatpura. Calculating Rs. 1100/-per sq.yard and for 50% of the land i.e. 7139 sq.yards, the value of the land had been fixed at Rs. 78,52,900/-. The amount of Rs. 25lakh was due to Patel Baldevbhai Dahyabhai, Rs. 22lakh to Amrutbhai Narandas and the amount of Rs. 31,52,900/- to Jayantibhai i.e. to the present appellant. As has been agreed to by the respondent, this was given in writing towards the outstanding dues of these persons.34.3 The outstanding dues, of course, is Rs. 36lakh, however, parcel of land was valued at Rs. 31,52,900/- since the complainant also had agreed to take lesser value than the actual amount due.34.4 The stamp paper has been purchased by his paternal cousin namely Mr. Bharatbhai Kachrabhai Patel, three to four days prior to the execution of the said writing dated 12.2.2002, the community leader had also met, since, there was no power of attorney executed pursuant to the amount lent to the respondent, which according to the complainant had been given by 23.12.2001, by way of his bona-fide gesture, he had agreed to transfer him the part of his land. It is also the case of the complainant that the property of respondent was mortgaged with the bank and hence the sale deed could not be executed in favor of the complainant for a long time and hence, entire deal could not sail through and eventually, the respondent issued a cheque dated 13.10.2002 drawn on State Bank of India signed by the respondent himself and the cheque returned memo indicates that due to insufficient funds on 1.11.2002 the cheque could not be honored.35. This Court notices that on the part of the appellant-original complainant, regard has been made to the promissory note averred to have been written by the respondent No.2. This note would be required to be proved as the primary evidence and in absence thereof, the principle of admissibility of the secondary evidence shall be regarded.35.1 Thus, in absence of the original promissory note, which the complainant could not produce and in wake of the deposition of the complainant, both examination-in-chief as well as the cross examination, it could be said that the complainant had succeeded in proving the legally enforceable debt.35.2 This Court is also aware of the fact that so far as the promissory note is concerned, according to the complainant-appellant, it was given by the respondent herein. However, the original promissory note, at no point of time, was brought on record. At the fag end of trial, a request was made by the appellant before the Court concerned to permit the original promissory note to be brought on record and further allow the affidavit of two persons, viz. Mr.Natvarlal Gandalal and Mr.Jagdishbhai Mafatlal.35.3 The trial Court denied such a request on the ground that this being a private complaint, the complainant ought to have shown those persons as his their witnesses. If they had not been shown as witnesses, the permission of the Court ought to have been taken. However, directly no person can be permitted the production of affidavit. So far as the promissory note is concerned, the Court held that if such document was in the custody of the complainant from the beginning, the same ought to have been produced at the stage of recordance of the evidence. When it was asked for at the stage of making final submissions, the same was denied vide order dated 7.6.2013.35.4 This order was challenged before the City Civil and Sessions Court by way of Criminal Revision Application No.311 of 2013.35.5 After hearing both the sides, the City Sessions Court on referring to Section 255 of the Criminal Procedure Code held that the said provision makes it clear that the learned Magistrate on its own or on an application, may issue summons to any witness directing him to produce any document. However, it was the third party which was seeking permission to submit affidavits, and under which provision they were seeking the same, was unclear. The Court rejected the said application upholding the order passed by the learned Magistrate. And, aggrieved appellant approached this Court by way of Special Criminal Application No.3894 of 2013.This Court (Coram : Honourable Mr. Justice G.R. Udhwani, J) notices that such an application (Exh.66) was made after recording the statement of accused under Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code. It was also noted that the respondent No.2 had alleged of kidnapping and of his signatures having been obtained on an agreement for sale of his properties forcefully and he also alleged that the cheque was stolen from the office of his brother. The Court held that in the further statement recorded under section 313 if the allegations are made therein, the burden to make such allegations good is upon the accused. Therefore, the statement made under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. cannot be considered as independent evidence and there can not be any rebuttal of such statement. Referring to the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Natasha versus Central Investigation Bureau, reported in (2013) 5 SCC 741, the Court reiterated the principle in relation to the power under section 313 of the Cr.P.C. Furthermore, on the ground that the case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, was tried in a summary way and the petitioner had all the opportunities to place on the record the evidence during the trial, the Court rejected summarily the petition of the appellant. Thus, it can be said that a request of rebutting the details which have come on the record in further statement under section 313 of the Code, did not succeed.The appellant because of some reasons could not produce the promissory note, which according to him, had reflected the promise from the respondent of paying back the amount of Rs. 36 lakh. As the other two witnesses, whose affidavits were sought to be brought on record, were also not permitted as they did not fit into the scheme of Section 255 nor under section 311 of the Cr.P.C., they were not called. Therefore, the evidence that the appellant could adduce before the Court through his oral deposition and promise on the part of the respondent to transfer portion of his immovable properties, it gets established that the outstanding due, out of Rs. 36lakh, is reflected and valued Rs. 31,52,900/-. The statement is for some more or less amount than the amount of the cheque which has been dishonored. The statement also did not said through as the property had been mortgaged with some of the banks, from which the present respondent had taken advance. The appellant-original complainant is not aware as to whether two persons in whose favour the writing was executed along with the promise transfer the land, whether any criminal case was pending, however, according to the learned advocate Mr.Baqui who is representing the respondent, no criminal case in relation to the amount specified for both these persons respectively Rs. 25 lakh and Rs. 22 lakh, is pending.. It is pointed out to this Court that the respondent is facing various litigations, since, he had borrowed the amounts from many persons. The application given to the police by the North Gujarat Association through Shri.Jayantilal Mafatlal Patel is forming the part of the record of the trial Court. Exhibit-59 speaks of the respondent having manipulated from various persons and also defrauded them by alluring them to park their money in S.B.Fabrics, which, according to him, is the biggest private limited company with the promise of doubling their money, if invested, within three years.It is this manipulation, which generated trust and the investment of crores of rupees had been obtained by him. A list is also produced consisting names of about 33 persons with amount, varying from Rs. 1lakh to Rs. 4.46crore. A request is made to the Police Officer to investigate into this economic offence. A copy of this also had been sent to the LIC, Branch Manager and the respondent, therefore, had addressed a communication to the present-Respondent, where, he was required to submits his explanation and on 04.07.2017, he had stated that he had no partnership nor any share in or directorship in the said S.B.Fabrics and if, any one has engaged and parked his money in S.B. Fabrics, he has nothing to do with the same. Because, this Company or the partnership is of his two sons, who are independently looking after the business and he, as a father, has no role to play. So far as the present complainant is concerned, whose letter had initiated this inquiry, he had stated that it was the complainant and others, who have invested their amounts in the Company. However, it is only to cause damage to his reputation, he had written such a letter to the LIC. One witness, namely Mukesh Shah, who was working as Asst. Director in the office of the LIC, Ahmedabad on 30.07.2012 had deposed on the basis of various documents, which had been tendered before the LIC Branch. After this reply, the proceedings had been wound-up. It is also worthwhile, at this stage, to refer to the list of documents produced vide Exhibit-7 before the trial Court, whereby, the details of the various quashing petitions and criminal cases registered against this respondent No.2 have been detailed. The application was fixed for hearing. These documents had been produced along with written submissions under Section 314 of the Code and a request was made to take judicial notice of those documents on the ground that merely taking the same on record would not prejudice, in any manner, the defence of the respondent and that, with an objection of the part of the respondent, were taken on record before this Court (Annexure-E).Sr.No\tName and Address\tRelation with the Complainant\tComplantdate and the Court\tCheque No. and Bank\tDate of Presenta tion of cheque\tAmount\tStatus\n1\tJayantilal Mafatlal Patel 3 Simla Avenue Shahibaug Ahmedabad\tComplainanthimself\t13/4/04 Court No.2 Meghani nagar\t574147 SBI Girdhar nagar\t30/10/02\tRs. 36,00,000\tPresent Case\n2\tKachra Soma Patel 2 Shahi Shivam Soc.

As indicated above, (i) the cases at Sr. Nos.2 and 3 are pending for adjudication; (ii) the cases at Sr. Nos.4,6,10,13,14 and 15 have been settled and those complaints have been withdrawn; (iii) the cases at Sr. Nos.5 and 11, he has been acquitted; (iv) the cases at Sr.Nos.7,8 and 9, where, the revision petitions are pending before this Court.37.2 It would be apt to refer in connection with the case at Sr.No.12, which is Criminal Case No. 1702 of 2002, pending before the Court of the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Ahmedabad, for an offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, the present Respondent had preferred a petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 of the Code for quashing and setting aside the said criminal case. The Court has recorded relevant paragraphs of the affidavit-in-reply filed by the complainant, who was respondent in that matter, stating therein that respondent had been doing business \"in the benami name of his three sons, namely Chirag Patel, Sachin Patel and Alpesh Patel by starting S.B. Fabrics' at Changodar, wherein, all the three sons of the respondent were directors and the money was required by the petitioner for his sons in the business of process house in the name of S.B. Fabrics Private Limited.\" It is, further, contended in the affidavit that \"petitioner had mortgaged his bungalow obtaining the loan from Cooperative Bank for financing benami business of his sons in the name of S.B. Fabrics.\" The affidavit further shows that \"The petitioner had obtained the loan of Rs. 10 lakh on the basis of the original documents of his bungalow. The petitioner had also sold off his bungalow by creating duplicate documents of the original documents without obtaining release of the mortgage from the Cooperative Bank of Ahmedabad. When the Cooperative Bank of Ahmedabad came to know through its officers about the aforesaid fraud committed by the petitioner with the Bank, the officers of the Bank had filed an FIR being I-C.R. No.17 of 2003 for the offence under Section 400, 420, 465, 467 etc. of the Indian Penal Code against the petitioner and other accused at Karjan Police Station.\"37.3 These details were held to be sufficient by the Court not to interfere in exercise of inherent powers conferred upon this Court under Section 482 of the Code. Hence, such petition was not entertained. These are some of the circumstances, which had been presented before the trial Court by the appellant, herein, to indicate the overall conduct and the antecedents of the respondent. Undoubtedly, on the main issue, as to whether, the appellant can establish the guilt of the respondent accused in committing the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act is an area, where, over and above the deposition of the complainant, deposition of other witnesses, who have been examined by the complainant also are vital to be considered for establishing the required ingredients of proving the case under section 138 of NI Act.37.4 This discussion in the opinion of this Court was essentially to point out that the complainant could establish his transactions with the respondent, where, he had furnished the details as to how he has collected the amount from his different relatives and eventually had shown the respondent having agreed to pay back the amount in the very year by transferring half of the portion of his land. Of course, he had to get the land cleared, which was mortgaged with the Bank, which since, he could not do, as stated in the examination-in-chief and has stood up in the cross-examination. The complainant was handed over the cheque, which was dishonored.38. At this stage, the deposition of the bank Officer, Vishnubhai Somabhai Patel is to be considered who had stated that he knew the complainant and his Saving Account number is SB / 1000 and the cheque bearing No.574147 was deposited in his account on 30.10.2002, was dishonored, as there was no sufficient balance and hence, return memo dated 01.01.2002 reflects 'Insufficient Funds'(Exhibit-20).38.1 Another Bank Officer, Exhibit-30, namely, Parmeshwari Bhagwandin Sharma, stated that cheque (Exhibit-19) is of their Bank and the account of the respondent had been closed on 25.12.2002. The impugned cheque (Exhibit-19) which was presented to the Bank for clearance on 01.11.2002, the same was returned due to insufficient funds. He had also shown the account opening form and the account closing form.39. It would be apt to refer to Exhibit-43, which is an application by Respondent No.2 under his signature, making a request to call some of the persons as defence witnesses. This included the handwriting expert, a responsible officer from LIC, Ahmedabad Branch No.4/841, Tejabhai Bababhai.The Court after hearing both the sides, had ordered, wherein, it denied the request of examining handwriting expert. The defence on the part of the respondent is of the cheque having been stolen from his bag, since, he was working as Development Officer in LIC. The Court, since, did not find any complaint having been made by the respondent in that regard and as in the case of the complainant, he had stated that all the details have been filled in by the respondent No.2, in his presence, in the cheque, the Court deemed it fit not to refer the cheque to the handwriting expert. It, however, permitted someone familiar, from the office of LIC to be examined. Since, some of the documents produced at Annexures A, B, and C were denied by the complainant. He has an application tendered by the complainant to the LIC Branch and hence, the officer concerned was permitted.. It is, thus, very clear that all the documents were made on the part of the respondent to bring home his defence of the cheque having been stolen and the signature not being that of his.. It would be to also refer to the notice, which has been issued by the complainant, after the cheque had been dishonored. There is no reply by the respondent to the said notice. It is since mandatory for any party to issue notice as provided under the provisions of the NI Act, before he prosecutes a person for dishonor of the cheque, a notice has been issued within a period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the information from the bank with regard to the return of the cheque, and thus, such requirement has been duly fulfilled by the present applicant. The drawer of the cheque being the respondent, herein, not only failed to make the payment of the said amount to the payee-appellant within a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of such notice, but, he also chose not to reply to the same. On expiry of the period of 30 days, the appellant preferred the criminal complaint before the trial Court concerned, the details of which have already been mentioned herein above. It is also not in dispute that the cheque had returned, as per the Bank memo on account of insufficient balance in the account of the drawer. The cheque bearing No.574147 for the sum of Rs. 36 lakh had returned due to insufficient balance. Considering the ratio, which has been laid down in the above referred decisions and also particularly in the decisions of the 'RANGAPPA VS. MOHAN'(Supra) and also in the case of 'T. VASANTHAKUMAR VS. VIJAYAKUMARI' (Supra), it can be conclusively held that presumption included under Section 139 of the NI Act does include the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability. Issuance of notice of demand and its non reply by the respondent with specific proof of issuance of cheque by the respondent No.2 can conclude as per the decision of Vijay Vs. Laxman and others (supra) that the appellant, original complainant reasonably discharged the burden that the cheque had been issued towards a lawful payment.. It can be also concluded reiteratively that the complainant has succeeded before the trial Court in proving the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability. Even if the withdrawal of the amounts from various relatives has not come directly from the bank accounts, the complainant succeeded in proving the same through the oral evidence and also by providing accurate details of various relatives from whom, he had collected the amount to be handed over to the respondent-accused. As a result of which, the respondent No.2 had agreed to make the payment to the tune of Rs. 31 lakh and odd by giving a portion of his land of the property to the complainant in the event of his non-fulfillment of his promise of making the appellant a partner in the business for which the complainant had trusted him and handed over the huge sum. It is a matter of record that on the failure of the respondent-accused to even honour the obligation by getting the land cleared from the Bank, where, it was mortgaged, he had chosen to issue a cheque for Rs. 36 lakh.This was done in the month of October/November, when the entire transaction failed and the same when was presented to the Bank, it resulted into dishonor of the cheque. The overall circumstances, which thus emerged on record, and which the complainant succeeded in proving from the oral as well as documentary evidence lead to the conclusion of existing of legally enforceable debt. Number of complainants have been filed against the respondent-accused and which also resulted into his conviction in some of the matters. Although, these are additional factors and grounds they also are substantiating the say of the complainant. This Court holds firmly that the trial Court committed no error in believing that the complainant succeeded in discharging the burden that there exists a legally enforceable debt or liability, and thereafter, the legal presumption was required to be dislodged or rebutted by the accused-respondent, which he miserably failed to do with preponderance of probabilities, and therefore, findings and the conclusions arrived at by the Sessions Court deserve to be quashed and set aside. The judgment and order of the appellate Court, as can be seen from appreciation of evidence that the view taken by the Appellate Court is unsustainable being contrary to the well settled cannon of law on the subject as also established by various decisions of the Apex Court.46. The respondent No.2 was required to discharge the burden under Section 118 and 139 of the N.I. Act that the cheque he issued of Rs. 36 lakh was not issued towards discharge of legal debt but was issued in view of security or was obtained unlawfully or was issued otherwise, since the appellant succeeded in proving the initial burden reasonably existence of legal debt as was required under the law.46.1 With no reply to the notice of demand initially and in absence of any complaint to the police or otherwise in connection with his version that the impugned cheque having been stolen from his brother, the respondent No.2 cannot be said to have discharged his burden as required of him by the law.46.2 His attempt to bring on record theory of stolen cheque in his further statement after many years is nothing but a calculative chance or an afterthought, however, neither that attempt nor his detailed cross examination comes nowhere nearer even to discharge his burden, even with a comparatively lighter scale of proof i.e. preponderance of probabilities.46.3 His line of cross-examination also reveals clearly that the business of S.B. Fabrics (process house) was purchased from father of Mr. Gautam Adani and his sons were looking after this business. He attempted to say that he was not involved personally in running the business and there were certain litigations in respect of the said process house, however, that version, on the contrary, as held by the trial Court, favours the complainant's story. His aspirations for his family and his purchase of a huge business is the cause of his facing various litigations under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. Respondent No.2, in fact, as can be held unhesitantly, failed to dislodge the positive proof.46.4 Section 139 of the N.I. Act stipulates that the Court shall presume unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of the cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in Section 138 for discharge of debt or liability.46.5 Section 3 when read with Section 4 of the Evidence Act, it can be said that Whenever it is directed by the Court that the Court shall presume a fact, it shall regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved. Section 3 defines the expression 'disproved' that a fact is said to be disproved when, after considering the matters before it, the Court either believes that it does not exist, or considers its non-existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it does not exist. Word 'proved' under the very section stipulates the converse that 'A fact is said to be proved when after considering the matters before it, the Court either believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. None of the matters brought on record either by way of cross-examination or by further statement or otherwise, are such which can make the existence of those facts so probable that their existence would be believed by a prudent man so as to displace and dislodge the positive proof available on record. Appeal disposed of",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9936\n**Facts**:  This appeal is directed against the judgment of acquittal dated 10.08.2006, made in S.T.C.No.1743 of 2005, on the file of the learned District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate, Sivagiri, Tirunelveli District.  For the sake of convenience, the parties are referred to as 'the complainant and the accused'.\\n\\n3. The prosecution case, in brief, is as follows: The accused has borrowed a sum of Rs. 3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lakhs only) on 24.01.2005 and issued a post-dated (06.06.2005) cheque-Ex.P.1 on 06.05.2005. When the complainant presented the above cheque for encashment through his banker, the same was dishonoured for the reason 'insufficient funds' under Ex.P.2-Memorandum.  Thereafter, the complainant issued a legal notice-Ex.P.3 on 01.08.2005. The accused, having received the same, sent a reply notice (Ex.P.5) on 05.08.2005 with false contentions. Hence, the complaint. 3.2. Before the Trial Court, the complainant himself was examined as P.W.1 and Exs.P.1 to P.5 were marked. On completion of the examination of witness on the side of the prosecution, the accused was questioned under Section 313 Cr.P.C., as to the incriminating circumstances found in the evidence of the prosecution witness and he denied them as false.  On the side of defence, the accused himself was examined as D.W.1, however, no document was marked on his side. Challenging the order of acquittal passed by the learned District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate, Sivagiri, Tirunelveli District, the present Criminal Appeal has been filed by the complainant.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: On consideration of evidence available on record, the learned District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate, Sivagiri, Tirunelveli District found that the complainant has not proved his case beyond reasonable doubt and thereby, acquitted the accused.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the complainant would contend that the accused has not discharged the legal presumption attached to the cheque and it is not in dispute that the dishonoured cheque was that of the accused. The accused has taken two different stands. On earlier occasion, it was his stand that the cheque in question was stolen. Absolutely, there is no evidence to substantiate the same. Whereas, during trial, he has taken a different stand that there was no privity of contract between the complainant and the accused. Similarly, the previous conduct of the accused in some other case clearly shows that he used to set up a defence in such a nature. Hence, it is submitted that once the cheque is dishonoured and the ingredients of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, have been established, it is for the accused to discharge the legal presumption attached to the cheque. Mere denial is not sufficient to discharge the legal presumption. In support of his contention, he has also relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Criminal Appeal No.803 of 2018 [Kishan Rao v. Shankargouda, decided on 02, July, 2018]. Hence, the learned Senior Counsel prayed for allowing the appeal.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the accused would contend that the evidence adduced on the side of P.W.1 itself clearly indicates that there was no privity of contract between the accused and the complainant. As an accused, he has brought the circumstances to discharge the legal presumption and once legal statutory presumption has been discharged, the burden is again shifted on the complainant to prove the passing of consideration. Absolutely, there is no evidence available on record to show that the complainant has discharged his burden. The Trial Court has rightly appreciated the evidence and acquitted the accused. Hence, he prayed for dismissal of the appeal.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 7. I have considered the rival submissions and perused the materials available on record. . It is the specific case of the complainant that the accused has borrowed a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees Three Lakhs only) on 24.01.2005 and issued Ex.P.1-cheque. Of course, Ex.P.1 cheque, when presented for encashment, was dishonoured and statutory notice was also issued within a time. These aspects are not in dispute. Though, at the initial stage, the accused, in his reply statement, took a defence to the effect that the cheque was stolen, there was no material to substantiate the above defence. But the fact remains that in the cross-examination of P.W.1, certain circumstances were brought in by the accused.  It is well settled that the statutory presumptions available under Section 118 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, can be discharged by the accused. Such presumption cannot be static. It can be discharged by bringing out probabilities. The probabilities always need not be by way of direct evidence. Even circumstantial evidence or even admission on the side of the complainant is sufficient to discharge the legal presumption. Mere denial by the accused of consideration or issuance of the cheque will not discharge the legal presumption. . The evidence of P.W.1, when carefully seen, his entire evidence in cross-examination read together, the same indicates that there is no privity of contract between the accused and himself. In fact, he has shown ignorance about the nature of legal notice issued by the accused and himself. He appears to have totally ignorant of the facts. His entire evidence indicates that only his brother had some dealing with the accused. He has also categorically admitted that he never had any transaction with the accused.  When that being the position, advancing huge amount of Rs. 3,00,000/- on 24.01.2005 is highly improbable. Further, advancing such huge amount on 24.01.2005 without any document on the same day is also highly improbable. The very complaint itself clearly indicates that the sum of Rs. 3,00,000/- was paid without any document on 24.01.2005. Thereafter, only, on his insistence, the accused gave a cheque on 06.05.2005. Paying huge amount without any document, at the first instance, is against the normal human conduct. Hence, this Court does not find any material to hold that the complainant has proved his case.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue of the case is whether the respondent-accused is guilty of dishonoring a cheque under Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. The lower court quashed and set aside the conviction of the respondent, ruling that the complainant failed to provide sufficient evidence proving the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability. \n\nThe lower court's judgment appears to be based on the legal principle that the presumption of a legally enforceable debt or liability under Section 139 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act can be rebutted by the accused. In this case, the respondent raised a defense that the alleged debt was not legally enforceable, which the court accepted.\n\nHowever, a critical analysis of the case reveals that the respondent failed to provide any concrete evidence to refute the existence of the debt. Instead, he offered land as collateral and attempted to clear the bank dues. This action might have been an indication that he acknowledged the debt, but it did not directly disprove the complainant's claim.\n\nConsidering the evidence presented and the legal principle involved, it appears that the lower court's decision to quash the conviction is not well-founded. Therefore, the appeal should be allowed, and the respondent should be convicted under Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. \n\nOutput: ALLOWED"

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nBy this application under section 482 of the Cr.P.C., 1973, the applicant-original accused No.3, seeks to invoke the inherent powers of this Court praying for quashing of the proceedings of the Criminal Case No.633 of 2017 in the court of the 11th Judicial Magistrate, Rajkot arising from the complaint filed by the respondent No.1-original complainant for the offence punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. t appears from the materials on record that the respondent No.1-H.D.F.C. Bank Ltd. filed a complaint under section 138 of the Act against a partnership firm and its partners. The partnership firm is the accused No.1 in the complaint and the accused Nos. 2 to 11 are the partners of the firm.  The applicant herein is the accused No.3 in the complaint. The complaint reads as under; \"1. The complainant Bank is registered and incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act 1956, having its Rajkot office at 2nd Floor, Opp. Mahatma Gandhi High School, Rajkot. Complainant Bank is in business of providing various loans. The present complaint is filed by the authorized officer who is authorized to file such complaint.\\n\\n2. That the accused approached the complainant Bank for the purpose of procurement of Finance by the way of TERM LOAN and at the request of the accuse, financial assistance was provided to them under agreement No.81034097. At the time of procurement of finance, the accused accepted all the terms and conditions stipulated by the complainant Bank. . That, accused No.1 is borrower of the Term Loan Granted through their partners who are engaged in the day to day activity of the firm, whom are mentioned as accused No.2 to 11. Moreover, Accused No.2 to 11 have also stood as the co-borrower of the financial assistance obtained by them.\\n\\n4. The accused gave cheque as per following details, duly signed by the accused towards the legal debt which the accused had incurred on account of financial assistance provided to the accused by the complainant. Accused also gave assurance that, said cheque will be honoured on presentation.\\n\\nCheque No.\tCheque Date\tDrawn On\tAmount\tReason\tMemo Date\\n18\t05/11/16\tHDFC Bank\tRs. 373057/-\tInsufficient Funds\t05.11.2016\\n19\t\t\tRs. 373057/-\t\t05.11.2016\\n20\t\t\tRs. 373057/-\t\t05.11.2016\\n Cheque No.\tCheque Date\tDrawn On\tAmount\tReason\tMemo Date\\n18\t05/11/16\tHDFC Bank\tRs. 373057/-\tInsufficient Funds\t05.11.2016\\n19\t\t\tRs. 373057/-\t\t05.11.2016\\n20\t\t\tRs. 373057/-\t\t05.11.2016\\n\\n5. The complainant presented the said cheque with its Banker for realization and the same was dishonoured by the accused's Banker as per above mentioned detail. The said cheque was presented in account maintained at Rajkot and the same was dishonoured in Rajkot. 6. Upon receipt of the said memo, the accused was called upon by statutory demand notice dated 29.11.2016 within the prescribed limitation period, to make payment of the aforesaid amount within the stipulated time. The said notice has been served upon accused on or around 03.12.2016 and they have replied the same through their Advocate through email of our Advocate. However, the accused failed to make payment. Hence, the accused has committed offence as prescribed u/s.138 r/w. 142 of the N.I. Act 1881. 7. The complainant submits that as the complainant maintains their account in the Bank which is within the jurisdiction of this Court, therefore Hon'ble Court has jurisdiction to try the case and punish the accused if he is found guilty under the provisions of the said Act.\"  Mr. Aditya A. Gupta, the learned counsel appearing for the applicant-accused vehemently submitted that the complaint under section 138 of the Act is not maintainable as his client is neither the signatory to the cheques in question nor the partner of the firm. According to the learned counsel, the applicant was one of the sleeping partners in the partnership firm.  The applicant came to be inducted as a partner vide the partnership deed dated 08.06.2009. The partnership was, thereafter, reconstituted on 31.12.2014 vide the partnership deed dated 31.12.2014. In the said deed, it has been recorded that the applicant and the others have retired as the partners on 7.10.2014 in pursuance to an understanding arrived at between the partners. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\n. Thus, according to the learned counsel appearing for the applicant, the prosecution for the offence under section 138 of the N.I. Act is not maintainable against the applicant, as on the date of the commission of the alleged offence, the applicant was not the partner of the firm.  In such circumstances, referred to above, the learned counsel prays that there being merit in this application, the same be allowed and the proceedings of the criminal case be quashed so far as the applicant is concerned.  In support of his submissions, the learned counsel has placed reliance on the following decisions;\\n\\nSr. No.\tJudgment & Proposition\tAnnexure/Relevant Paras\\n1\tDCM Financial Services Ltd. vs. J.N.

Otherwise, his deposition in support of the complaint would not be valid. . Thus, the case of the complainant is that the issue whether on the date of the commission of the alleged offence, the applicant was a partner of the firm or not, being a disputed question of fact, the same cannot be gone into by this Court in the present proceedings. The principal argument of the learned counsel appearing for the complainant is that assuming for the moment that the applicant-accused had retired as a partner from the partnership firm, whether such retirement could be said to be in accordance with law, and if such retirement could not be said to be in accordance with law, then even if the applicant has ceased to be the partner, the applicant would not get absolved from her liability under section 138 read with section 141 of the Act. In such circumstances, referred to above, the learned counsel prays that there being no merit in this application, the same be rejected.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n On the other hand, this application has been vehemently opposed by Mr. Vivek B. Gupta, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent No.1-original complainant. Mr. Gupta has filed his written submissions. The written submissions are as under;\\n\\n\"1. The applicant, being original accused has preferred the present petition for quashing Criminal Case No.633 of 2017 pending before the 11th Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Rajkot under Section 138 read with Section 141 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against them, whereby she has been impleaded as accused in her capacity as partner of M/s Radheshyam Cottex on the ground that she had retired as partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex before the presentation of the said cheques for collection by the respondent No.1 and as such she cannot be prosecuted under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In support of her contention, the applicant has annexed an alleged Deed of Reconstitution of Partnership dated 31/12/2014 and 'Form-G' of Register of Firms relating to M/s Radheshyam Cottex along with the memo petition.\\n\\n2. The relevant provisions of The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 relating to retirement of a partner from a partnership firm, which would be necessary for deciding the present petition are as follows: 3. A bare perusal of sub-Section (3) of Section 32 makes it clear that notwithstanding the retirement of a partner from a firm, he / she and the partners continue to be liable as partners to third parties for any act done by them which would has been an act of the firm if done before the retirement, until public notice is given of the retirement. In the present case, admittedly, there is no publication of the retirement in the Official Gazette and no public notice in at least one vernacular newspaper circulating in the district where the firm to which it relates has its place or principal place of business has been given in the manner as prescribed in Section 72 of The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 (reproduced above) relating to retirement of the applicant as partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex and as such the applicant cannot be said to has legally retired from the partnership firm M/s Radheshyam Cottex as per the provisions of The Indian Partnership Act, 1932. In other words, since admittedly, there is no publication of retirement in the Official Gazette and further since no public notice in at least one vernacular news-paper circulating in the district where the firm to which it relates has its place or principal place of business has been published, as contemplated under Suction 32 read with Section 72 of The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 either by the applicant or by any partner of the reconstituted firm, the applicant still continues to be partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex and are liable to be prosecuted under Section 138 read with Section 141 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. As such, the applicant's submission that she has retired from M/s Radheshyam Cottex is thoroughly mis-conceived and not tenable at law. It would be pertinent to mention here that it is an undisputed position that at the time of availing loan from the respondent No.1 Bank and issuance of the subject cheques (3 Nos.) to it, the applicant was partner of M/s Radheshyam Cottex and in fact the applicant had also signed the subject loan agreement as partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex as well as in her individual capacity as a borrower/guarantor. In view of the above, the applicant is liable to discharge the liabilities of M/s Radheshyam Cottex to the respondent No.1 Bank and as such the impugned cheques (3 Nos.) issued in discharge of the said liability would be covered under the definition of \"legally enforceable debt\" and the applicant would be liable for dishonour of the said cheques in question. 4. In Vishwa Mitter of Vijay Bharat Cigarette Stores, Dalhousie Road, Pathankot Versus O.P. Poddar & Ors. (1983) 4 SCC 701 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if a special enactment provides for a specific procedure then that particular procedure has to be followed. Accordingly, since the applicant has admittedly not complied with the specific procedure relating to retirement as a partner prescribed under Section 32 read with Section 72 of The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, she continues to be a partner of the firm. 5. In fact, the applicant was very well aware of the said legal provisions of The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 and accordingly has been discharging her duties as partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex, continuously. In support of the said contention, the respondent No.1 refers to and relies upon pleadings of three legal proceedings wherein it has been asserted that she continue to be partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex. In this connection, it is submitted that in the memo of petition of SCA No.11977/2016 filed before this Hon'ble Court preferred by M/s Radheshyam Cottex against the respondent No.1 bank, which has been affirmed on 09-07-2016, it has been asserted in the very beginning that the applicant along with other partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex, who claim to has retired on the basis of the alleged Deed of Reconstitution of Partnership dated 31/12/2014, are still partners of the said partnership firm. Further, the said petition has been affirmed by Mr. Rahul Kanubhai Kothiya, the applicant No.6 herein, in his capacity as partner of M/s Radheshyam Cottex, who surprisingly claims to has retired from the partnership vide the said alleged Deed of Reconstitution of Partnership dated 31/12/2014.  his nails the applicant' pack of blatant lies that have been asserted on affidavit in the memo of the present application that she has retired as partner of M/s Radheshyam Cottex with effect from 07-10-2014, which is contrary to the stand taken in Special Civil Application No.11977/2016. A copy of memo of petition of S.C.A. No.11977 of 2016 is annexed as Annex: B' along with respondent No.1's reply affidavit. Further, even in written statement filed in O.A. No. 352 of 2016 before the DRT-II at Ahmedabad, which is affirmed in November, 2016, a copy whereof has been served on the counsel for the respondent No.1 bank on 06-12-2016, it has been asserted that the applicant is partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex, again, completely contrary to the stand taken by the applicant in the memo of the present application. This again shows that the applicant's averment on affidavit in the memo of the present application that she has retired as partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex with effect from 07-10-2014, is contrary to the stand taken in O.A. No.352/2016. A copy of the said written statement filed in O.A. No.352/2016 before the DRT-II at Ahmedabad is annexed as 'Annex.: C' along with the respondent No. 1's reply affidavit. 7. Furthermore, even in the memo of application of Civil 13529/2016 filed by M/s Radheshyam Cottex against the respondent No.1 bank, which has been affirmed on 15-12-2016, it has been again asserted that the applicant is a partner of the said partnership firm. The said application is again affirmed by Mr. Rahul Kanubhai Kothiya, in his capacity as a partner of M/s Radheshyam Cottex, who claims to has retired from the partnership vide the said alleged Deed of Reconstitution of Partnership dated 31/12/2014. A copy of the memo of application of CA No.13529 of 2016-filed before this Hon'ble Court is annexed as 'Annex.: D' to respondent No.1's reply affidavit. 8. The respondent No.1 Bank submits that the above self-contradictory stand taken by the applicant, amounts to playing fraud with the Hon'ble Court in addition giving false evidence as defined under Section 191 of The Indian Penal Code, 1860. As such the applicant are liable to be prosecuted and punished for giving false evidence under Section 193 of The Indian Penal Code, 1860.\\n\\n9. Now, coming to the contents of the alleged documents produced by the applicant in support of her petition, as regards the Deed of Reconstitution of Partnership dated 31-12-2014 is concerned, it seems that the same has been given effect from 07-10-2014; however the same has been executed by the concerned partners before a Notary Public on 31-12-2014. On going through the contents of the said Deed of Reconstitution of Partnership, more particularly the delay between execution of the same and the date on which it has been given effect to, creates serious doubts regarding the genuineness of the said document and it seems that the same has been prepared with malafide intention to achieve ulterior motives and ends, best known to the applicant and other partners of the partnership firm M/s Radheshyam Cottex. As such, the said document cannot be relied upon for quashing Criminal Case No.633/2017 against the petitioner herein, under Section 482 of The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the applicant should be relegated to the Trial Court to prove the said document in accordance with law, more particularly The Evidence Act, 1872. Further, while the applicant claims to have retired with effect from 07-10-2014 vide agreement dated 31-12-2014, the entry to this effect has been registered in Form-G more than a year thereafter, i.e.; on 22-01-2016. The unusual and unexplained delay caused in making the said entry again creates serious doubts with regard to the contents of the said document also and as such the same also cannot be considered for quashing the present case against the applicant. 10, Further, since the procedure for retirement of a partner from a partnership firm as provided under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 has admittedly not been followed by the applicant or any of the partners of the partnership firm M/s Radheshyam Cottex, and the applicant are still continuing to discharge her duties as partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex, as evident on the face of the pleadings of S.C.A. No.11977/2016, O.A. No.352/2016 and CA. No.13529/2016, copies whereof are annexed herewith, it cannot be said that the applicant has retired as partner of the said firm and as such she was partner of the firm on the date of dishonour of the cheque and also continues to be partner as on date and as such she is liable to be proceeded against for trial for having committed the offence under Section 138 read with Section 141 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. In the present case, the applicant has merely created a facade of her retirement from M/s Radheshyam Cottex, while actually she continue to be partners of the said partnership firm by discharging her duties towards the said firm as clearly evident on face of the pleadings of various litigations between the parties. 11. Last but not the least, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in a number of decisions, powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 are to be exercised sparingly and with caution to secure ends of justice, prevent abuse of process of any Court and to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code, depending upon the facts of each case. In the present case, undisputedly the applicant was partner of the partnership firm M/s Radheshyam Cottex at the time of applying and availing the loan from the respondent No.1, further she was also partner when the post dated cheques were handed over to the respondent No.1 Bank before reconstitution of the partnership firm. Further, even when the cheques got dishonoured, she was partner of the said firm and in fact still continue to be partner of the firm, in view of the specific provisions of The Indian Partnership Act, 1932 relating retirement of a partner, which has admittedly not been complied with by the applicant and/or any of the partners of the partnership firm M/s Radheshyam Cottex and the pleadings of different proceedings annexed herewith along with the reply affidavit. As such, it cannot be held by any stretch of imagination or legal provision or interpretation that the applicant has not committed the offence as envisaged under Section 138 read with Section 141 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and as such the present petition preferred under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C., 1973, deserves to be dismissed with heavy exemplary costs for misleading the Hon'ble Court and playing fraud with the Hon'ble Court, as described in necessary detail above, and for coercing the respondent No.1 to appear and contest a totally ill-conceived and malafide proceedings based on false evidence and fabricating false evidence, as aforesaid.\"\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe learned counsel invited my attention to the following averments made in paras-6 and 7 of the present application;\\n\\n\"6. That the complaint is not maintainable and vexatious in the eye of law as the petitioner is neither a partner of the firm which issued the cheque nor the petitioner is signatory of the cheques in question. The petitioner states that the facts of the matter is that the petitioner was one of the sleeping partners in the firm being M/s. Radheshyam Cottex vide its partnership deed dated 08.06.2009. Thereafter, the said partnership was reconstituted on 31.12.2014 vide partnership deed dated 31.12.2014. It is recorded in the said deed that the petitioner inter alia others retired as on 07.10.2014 in pursuance of an understanding and thus the partnership was reconstituted. Thus the petitioner ceased to be a partner of the said firm as on 07.10.2014. The petitioner states that the petitioner ceased to be partner of the said firm on 07.10.2014 however, the cheques in question were issued by the said firm much later on 05.11.2016. The petitioner states that by no stretch of imagination, the petitioner can be made liable for the dishonour of the said cheques, which were issued almost two years after the retirement of the petitioner from the firm. Copy of partnership deed dated 31.12.2014 and partnership deed dated 08.06.2009 and copy of FORM No.G issued by Registrar of Firms recording various changes in the firm are annexed herewith and marked as ANNEXURE-D(Colly).\\n\\n7. It is stated that in order to import vicarious liability to the petitioner, it is necessary that the petitioner ought to have been one of the partner of the firm which issued the cheque at the time when the cheque was issued. However, when the petitioner ceased to be one of the partners of the firm almost two years back from the date on which the cheques were issued, the petitioner cannot be made liable for dishonour of the cheques under the provisions of section 138 of the Act. It is further stated that it was well within the knowledge of the respondent No.1 that the petitioner is not one of the partners of the firm. This fact becomes absolutely clear from the language of the statutory notice.\"\n",
    "Case_Result": "Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and having considered the materials on record, the only question that falls for my consideration is whether the criminal proceedings should be quashed so far as the applicant is concerned.. Along with the affidavit-in-reply filed by the complainant opposing this application, few documents have been annexed. One of the documents is a memo of the Special Civil Application No.11977 of 2016 filed by the partnership firm M/s. Radheshyam Cottex with the following prayers;\n\n\"(a) YOUR LORDSHIPS BE PLEASED to quash and set aside the possession Notice dated 03.03.2016 under Section 13(4) issued by the Respondent HDFC Bank Ltd at Annexure C to this petition being illegal and in violation of Section 13(3A) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002 and to issue a writ of mandamus, certiorari or any other writ, direction or order to quash and set aside the aforesaid notices in the interest of justice.\n\n(b) YOUR LORDSHIPS BE PLEASED to issue a writ of mandamus to direct the Respondent to comply with the provision of Section 13(3A) and deal with the various objection/representation presented by the petition under Section 13(3A) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002.\n\n(c) YOUR LORDSHIPS BE PLEASED to restrain Respondent and/or their agents, servants to take further steps under the SARFAESI Act, 2002, qua the secured asset of the petitioner to the petition pending admission, hearing and final disposal of this petition.\n\n(d) YOUR LORDSHIPS BE PLEASED pass such other and further orders, which may be deemed fit, in the interest of justice.\"In the memo of the writ application, the averments made in para-1 are important. The averments are as under;\n\n\"(1) The petitioner is a partnership firm having partners (I) Pareshbhai Parbatbhai Kothiya (ii) Urmilaben Pareshbhai Kothiya (iii) Chimanbhai Kabariya (iv) Kapilbhai Kabariya (v) Kanubhai Kabariya (vi) Lilavantiben Kabariya (vii) Parbatbhai Kothiya (viii) Saileshbhai Kothiya (ix) Rahulbhai Kothiya (x) Bhailabhai Kothiya having its address mentioned in the cause title hereinabove. The present petition is being filed through the partner of the petitioner firm.'. Thus, in the writ application filed by the firm, it has been stated that Urmilaben Pareshbhai Kothiya, i.e., the applicant herein, is one of the partners of the firm. This writ application was affirmed on 9th July, 2016.13. In the decision reported in CDJ 2004 MHC 972, V.Sundaram Vs. E.Santhalingam, it is observed as follows:\n\n\"3. ........ From the decisions cited above, it is clear that a partner who has retired from the partnership is bound to give notice in a vernacular newspaper of the locality wherein the principal place of business of the partnership situated and also in the official gazette. Further from the judgments referred to above, it is also clear that notwithstanding the dissolution of the partnership firm, a partnership continues as to third persons who deal with the members thereof as partners until public notice of dissolution is given, even though, as between the partners the firm has been dissolved prior to such notice. In other words, a partnership is presumed to continue as to third persons until public notice of dissolution has been given unless the person dealing with the firm after its dissolution had actual knowledge of such dissolution. Section 45 of the Indian Partnership Act says that a partnership continues as to third persons unless the dissolving of the firm is taken to the knowledge of the third persons who deal with the firm.\"14. In the decision reported in 2007 (3) CTC 356 B.Narashimha Rao Vs. T.Raghavalu Naidu & Co, in paragraph 10 it is observed as follows:\n\n\"10. The said provision makes it very clear that in case of retirement or expulsion or dissolution, etc., it should be by notice to the Registrar of Firms under Section 63 of the Act and by publication in the Official Gazette in atleast in one vernacular newspaper circulated in the district where the firm does its business. Thus, the public notice as contemplated under this Section makes it very clear that the above three modes have to be carried out relating to the retirement or expulsion of the partners, etc.\"15. In the decision reported in CDJ 2007 MHC 1847, N.R.Mahesh Vs. N. Ashok, while considering a similar set of facts, the learned Judge has observed as under in paragraph 12 as follows:\n\n\"12. Though in the cause title it appears that the petitioner/accused has been prosecuted as if in his personal capacity, while elaborating the details of the petitioner, it has been stated that the petitioner is a partner of the firm. The name of the firm has been omitted in the cause title. The cheque in question has been issued only by the petitioner in the name of the partnership firm, mentioned in the complaint. Issuance of notice by the respondent/complainant to the petitioner is not in dispute. For the notice issued, no reply has been sent by the petitioner.\" I am in respectful agreement with the view taken by the learned Single Judge of the Madras High Court. The mode and the procedure prescribed for the purpose of retiring from a partnership firm has been explained under the provisions of sections 45, 63 and 72 of the Indian Partnership Act. If the legal procedure prescribed has not been followed, then the civil liability of a retiring partner continues to the third parties who deal with the members of the firm as partners until public notice of dissolution is given. However, I am dealing with a matter under section 138 of the N.I. Act. While considering the criminal liability of the retired partner of the firm or the partner of the dissolved firm under section 138 of the N.I. Act, the main question to be considered is as to whether on the date of issue of the cheque and on the date of arising of the cause of action, such partner was really and actually a partner of the firm or not.Having regard to the materials on record, I am of the view that the issue raised as regards the retirement of the applicant as a partner, on the firm being dissolved and re-constituted, is a highly disputed question of fact. Not only in the Special Civil Application No.11977 of 2016 filed by the partnership firm, as referred to above, the applicant has been shown as one of the partners, but even in the written submissions filed in O.A. No.352 of 2016 before the DRT (II) at Ahmedabad, affirmed in November, 2016, it has been asserted that the applicant is a partner of M/s. Radheshyam Cottex. This is evident from Annexure-C to the reply filed by the complainant. Furthermore, even in the memo of the Civil Application No. 13529/2016 filed by M/s. Radheshyam Cottex against the respondent No.1 Bank, which has been affirmed on 15.12.2016, it has been again asserted that the applicant is a partner of the said partnership firm. The said application is affirmed by one Mr. Rahul Kanubhai Kothiya, in his capacity as a partner of M/s. Radheshyam Cottex, who claims to have retired from the partnership vide the said alleged Deed of Reconstitution of Partnership dated 31.12.2014. This is evident from Annexure-D to the reply of the complainant. Order accordingly",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 634ea1de0eb98db8410fb15e\n**Facts**: This a complainant's appeal and is directed against Judgment dated 27.8.08 of the Learned J.M.F.C., Margao, acquitting the accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\\n\\n2. The complaint was filed for dishonour of two cheques, details of which are as follows :-\\n\\n1. Cheque no.162965, dated 12.1.07 for Rs.6,97,200/-.\\n\\n2. Cheque no.0188869, dated 12.1.07 for Rs.4,98,000/-. . The first cheque was drawn on ICICI Bank and the 2nd was drawn on bank of India. There is no dispute that both the cheques were presented by the complainant for encashment but were returned with endorsement that the funds were insufficient. The case of the complainant is that the said cheques were given by the accused to defraud him and without any intention to pay the amount due of Rs. 11,95,200/- knowing fully well that the said cheques were bound to bounce for lack of sufficient funds. The complainant sent separate legal notices, both dated 14.2.2007 in respect of the said two cheques demanding payment. The accused received the said notices and sent a reply. . In the reply, the accused took the plea that he was not liable to pay any amount to the complainant. The accused alleged that the complainant was doing money lending business and was in the habit of taking blank cheques and then filling the same and claiming huge amounts from the people. As regards the claim of the complainant that the said cheques were issued towards the sale amount of the shop of the accused situated at the New Market, Margao, Goa, the accused sated that the accused did not own any shop in the said market. The accused denied that the complainant had advanced to the accused Rs.11,95,200/-. The accused also called upon the complainant to give the details of the alleged payment of Rs. 11,95,200/- including the date of alleged payment, the manner of payment, the place where payment was made and the names of the witnesses who were present. The accused also called upon the complainant to give the copies of the said cheques so that the accused could comment on the writing on the same. As regards the first cheque the accused further stated that about four years prior to the date on the cheque, the accused had taken a private loan from the complainant of Rs. 10,000/ - and at that time the complainant had insisted that the accused should hand over a blank cheque to him as security, and in case the loan was not paid then he would take action but the accused subsequently paid the loan to the complainant and the said amount of the loan was paid through the servant of the accused who was asked to hand over the amount to the complainant and get the cheque back and at that time the complainant had informed the said servant that he was unable to trace the said cheque and avoided to return the same, but the accused did not realize the dishonest intention of the complainant. As regards the second cheque, the accused stated that in the year 2003 the accused had asked the complainant for a loan of Rs.2,00,000/- for construction of a house and the complainant had paid to the accused a sum of Rs. 1,80,000/- by deducting in advance the interest payable and at that time the complainant had asked to give a blank cheque and accordingly the second cheque was given without any writing and signature was taken of the accused.  The accused stated that the said loan of Rs. 1,80,000/- was paid in cash to the complainant with interest thereon but the complainant did not return the said cheque saying that the said cheque was not signed or filled and was only a piece of paper and the same was misplaced. The accused also stated that the complainant had recently approached the accused with an offer to purchase the flat of the accused but the accused refused to sell the flat and as such the complainant got annoyed and misused the two blank cheques which were with the complainant to pressurize the accused to sell the flat. The accused also stated that the second cheque was not a cheque or a negotiable instrument as it was not signed by the accused and the complainant had filled in the same and forged the signature of the accused. The accused also stated that the complainant was engaged in private money lending business which is an offence under law. The accused also called for an inspection of the said two cheques within fifteen days of the receipt of the reply. Admittedly, the complainant did not comply with any of the requests made by the accused in his said replies dated 21.2.2007 but proceeded to file the complaint and examine himself in support of the same. The accused did not lead any evidence but filed an additional written statement and in it further stated that both the cheques were fabricated.  The accused also stated that the said cheques were blank cheques given to the wife of the complainant as security towards the amount of Rs. 10,000/- and Rs. 1,80,000/- respectively taken by the accused from the complainant and his wife in the years 2003 and 2004. The accused also stated that subsequently the accused in the year 2004 asked the complainant for a loan of Rs.2,00,000/- and at that time the second cheque was taken as security but the entire sum of Rs. 1,80,000/- was repaid by the accused to the complainant and his wife within six months but the complainant did not return the cheque because the said cheque was not signed and filled and was merely a piece of paper and was misplaced. The accused further stated that both the cheques were not in her handwriting and they were not issued by the accused, as claimed by the complainant.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The Learned Magistrate after considering the evidence of the complainant came to the conclusion that the accused had succeeded in rebutting the presumptions available to the complainant in his favour and further held that the complainant had failed to establish the liability of the accused under the said cheques, beyond reasonable doubt. The Learned Magistrate observed that according to the complainant the said sum of Rs. 11,95,200/ - was paid in two installments within a period of four days and the installments were paid at the complainant's residence when one Conceicao Mascarenhas and the wife of the complainant were present but none of them were examined as witnesses by the complainant in support of his claim of payment. The Learned Magistrate also noted that according to the complainant a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/- was taken by the complainant from one Conceicao Mascarenhas as they intended to purchase a shop in partnership, from the accused and therefore the Learned Magistrate observed that the said Mr. Mascarenhas was an important witness to be examined but was not examined by the complainant.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: . Be that as it may, Shri. I. Agha, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant, submits that the accused has admitted that there were transactions between the complainant and the accused. Learned Counsel further submits that the defence taken by the accused in the reply to the statutory notice sent by the accused was not put to the complainant in his cross-examination. Referring to an answer to question no.4 of the statement recorded of the accused under Section 313 of the Code, Learned Counsel submits that the accused had given a false answer when it was admitted position that the cheques bounced because of insufficient funds into the account of the accused.  Learned Counsel further submits that in case according to the accused, loans were taken and repaid, the accused ought to have led some evidence in support of the said repayment and since the accused did not lead his own evidence or that of any other witness, an adverse inference has got to be drawn against the accused. Learned Counsel further submits that the complainant's case has always been consistent and the case of the complainant is supported by the presumptions which are in his favour. Learned Counsel further submits that various theories put forward by the accused either in the cross- examination of the complainant or in the additional statement filed were not at all proved by the accused. \n**Argument by Respondent**: . On the other hand, Shri. Kamat, the Learned Counsel on behalf of the accused, has firstly submitted that there is no averment in the complaint that the two cheques were given by the accused to the complainant in discharge of a legally enforceable liability. Learned Counsel further submits that the cross examination of the complainant shows that the case of the complainant is far from probable. Learned Counsel further submits that it is difficult to accept that the complainant would have lent two large sums of money within a span of four days and in case the said sums were advanced by the complainant in the presence of the said Mr. Mascarenhas or his wife, it was incumbent upon the complainant to have examined them to support his case and since the complainant has not examined them, this is a fit case to draw an adverse inference against the complainant, for their non- examination. Learned Counsel further submits that the accused right in the reply to the statutory notice had made it clear to the complainant that she did not own any shop in the New Market at Margao and in case according to the complainant, the two cheques were given by the accused towards the sale of the shop, then the complainant ought to have had some documents or procured the same to prove that the accused owned a shop. Learned Counsel has further submitted that the trial Court has analyzed the evidence produced by the complainant and has come to a right conclusion, and, therefore this Court may not interfere with the same.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Admittedly, both the cheques issued by the accused to the complainant were returned because there was insufficient amount in the respective bank accounts of the accused and not for any other reason and in such a situation it could be safely assumed, that both the cheques were indeed signed by the accused, notwithstanding the defence taken by her that one of the cheques was not signed by her and therefore the complainant would have been certainly entitled to the benefit of the presumptions available to the complainant in terms of Sections 138 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  The accused had also not led any evidence in support of the very many pleas taken by her, either in her reply or in statement under section 313 of the Code but that does not mean that the complainant is entitled to succeed. Falsity or weakness in the defence version does not establish the case of complainant that is a fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence. The said presumptions are certainly rebuttable and it is well settled now that they can be rebutted on the basis of the very evidence of the complainant or by the accused leading his own. 5. Reverting to the facts of the case, Counsel on behalf of the complainant, may be right in contending that the accused did not substantiate the very many theories the accused had advanced in his defence. In fact, the accused has not. However, the case of the complainant has been very inconsistent and the complainant has floundered, as the cross- examination progressed and from this it can be safely concluded that the complainant has proved himself to be unreliable and this has made way for the accused to prove the non existence of consideration; or atleast that it was improbable or doubtful. The case of the complainant was that the two cheques were given by the accused to the complainant by way of repayment of advance of Rs.11,95,200/- as the accused did not wish to sell the shop earlier agreed to be sold by the accused to the complainant. The complainant did not set out in his complaint as to when he advanced the said sum of Rs.11,95,200/- to the accused and this inspite of the fact that in the reply the accused had called upon him to do so. In cross-examination the complainant stated that the said amount was advanced in the year 2004 in two installments and within four days and the complainant wished the Court to believe that he had advanced the said sums of Rs.6,97,200/- and Rs.4,98,000/- in cash to the accused in a span of four days without any receipt or for that matter any agreement for the sale of the shop. The complainant in further cross-examination, stated that the shop was agreed to be purchased by him and by one Conceicao Mascarenhas and the latter had advanced a sum of Rs. 10,00,000/ - while he took a sum of Rs. 1,95,200/- from his wife. However, the complainant did not spelt out this position in the complaint nor explained as to why, if two of them wanted to purchase the shop, there was no much divergence in their contribution towards the purchase price of the shop. Admittedly, the complainant did not examine the said Conceicao Mascarenhas, nor his wife.  The complainant also could not substantiate his claim that he had taken Rs. 1,95,200/- from his wife. When cross-examined on this aspect, the complainant stated that he had withdrawn Rs. 1,95,200/- in three installments, two installments being of Rs.50,000/- and one installment of Rs. 1,00,000/- but on further cross-examination, the complainant admitted that the withdrawal of Rs. 1,00,000/- was on 10.12.04 and withdrawal of Rs.50,000/- was on 19.7.04 but ultimately was compelled to admit that he did not remember how much he withdrew and again stated that he had withdrawn Rs. 1,10,000/- from which he gave Rs.50,000/- to the accused and kept the balance with him. All this would not have happened in case the complainant had advanced the sum of Rs.11,95,200/- in two installments as stated by him The complainant would also have remembered the date and the month as the sums were quite large. Counsel on behalf of the complainant submits that the complainant had withdrawn the money in installments of Rs.50,000/- because of the restrictions placed by the Income Tax Act. If that be the case, one fails to understand how the complainant paid such a huge amount to the accused in cash and that too without any receipt. \n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "Certainly, here's a summary:\n    The applicant was a partner of M/s Radheshyam Cottex and in fact the applicant had issued the cheques in question for discharge of the debt owed by the firm to the complainant bank. It is alleged further that the applicant had retired as a partner from the partnership firm, but such retirement could not be said to be in accordance with law, and if such retirement could not be said to be in accordance with law, then even if the applicant has ceased to be the partner, the applicant would not get absolved from her liability under section 138 read with section 141 of the Act. The allegation against the applicant is that she was a partner of M/s Radheshyam Cottex on the date of the commission of the alleged offence. The allegation further is that the applicant had issued the cheques in question for discharge of the debt owed by the firm to the complainant bank. It is alleged further that the applicant had retired as a partner from the partnership firm, but such retirement could not be said to be in accordance with law, and if such retirement could not be said to be in accordance with law, then even if the applicant has ceased to be the partner, the applicant would not get absolved from her liability under section 138 read with section 141 of the Act.  The relevant provisions of the Partnership Act, 1932 relating to retirement of a partner from a partnership firm, which would be necessary for deciding the present petition are as follows: Sub section (3) of section 32 makes it clear that notwithstanding the retirement of a partner from a firm, he / she and the partners continue to be liable as partners to third parties for any act done by them which would has been an act of the firm if done before the retirement, until public notice is given of the retirement. In the present case, admittedly, there is no publication of retirement in the Official Gazette and no public notice in at least one vernacular newspaper circulating in the district where the firm to which it relates has its place or principal place of business has been given in the manner as prescribed in section 72 of the Partnership Act, 1932 either by the applicant or by any partner of the reconstituted firm, the applicant still continues to be partners of M/s Radheshyam Cottex and are liable to be prosecuted under section 138 read with section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  In the light of the above discussion, the petition for quashing of the criminal case is devoid of any merit and the same may be rejected and dismissed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. The petitioner impugns order dated 22.04.2014 of the Revisional Court, whereby, the revision petition, filed by the respondent, impugning the summoning order dated 01.07.2011, was allowed and the complaint filed by the petitioner was dismissed on the ground that the statutory notice under section 138 of the negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), was issued belatedly.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n The petitioner filed a complaint alleging that the respondents had committed an offence under Section 138 of the Act. The intimation with regard to dishonour of the cheque, issued by the respondent, was received by the petitioner on 23.12.2006 and the statutory notice under Section 138 of the Act was issued on 22.01.2007. It was contended by the petitioner that the date on which intimation was received, being the date when the cause of action occurred, was to be excluded in terms of the Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.  Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the Revisional Court had erred in relying on the decision in Shiv Kumar (supra) as the said judgment is a decision referred by two judges, whereas a three judge bench in Econ Antri Limited vs. Rom Industries Limited and Another: 2014 11 SCC 769 : (AIR 2013 SC 3283), after considering the difference of opinion in two judgments of the Supreme Court specifically held that the day on which the cause of action arises i.e. the date of receipt of information, should be excluded.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n The contention of the respondents was that the notice was required to be issued within a period of thirty days whereas the notice st had been issued on the 31 day.  This was controverted by the respondents contending that since the term used was 'within 30 days of the receipt of information' and not 'within 30 days from the receipt of information', the first date i.e. 23.12.2006 was to be included in the computation of the period of 30 days.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe Revisional Court relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in Shiv Kumar vs. Natarajan: MANU/SC/1013/2009 held that st the notice under Section 138 of the Act having been issued on the 31 day, which is calculable by including the date on which the intimation is received, the complaint was ex facie barred by limitation and, accordingly, the revision petition was allowed and the complaint was dismissed on the ground that the statutory notice had been issued beyond the period of prescribed by the Act.\n",
    "Case_Result": "The petitioner received information of dishonour of the cheque on 23.12.2006. The notice was issued on 22.01.2007. If the said date (i.e. 23.12.2006) is to be included in the computation, then 22.01.2007 was the 31st day and notice would be beyond the prescribed period and if the said date is excluded then 22.01.2007 was the 30th day and notice would be within time.Seen from that perspective, the date on which the petitioner received the information of the dishonour of the cheque (i.e. 23.12.2006) is to be excluded for the purposes of computing the period of 30 days available under the Act for issuance of notice. On excluding the date 23.12.2006, from considering, it is seen that the th notice issued on 22.01.2007 has been issued on the 30 day, which would bring the said notice within the period prescribed.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 636a390c256c9ffed8242cb8\n**Facts**: The present petition has been filed under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 vide which the petitioners have challenged the summoning order dated 14th August, 2003 passed by the learned Matropolitan Magistrate, in complaint case No.315/1/03 (Manish Industries vs. Hindustan Cables Limited and Others) under Section 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short as 'Act') and also for setting aside the order dated 24th August, 2004 passed by the learned Magistrate rejecting the prayer and application of the petitioners for dropping the proceedings and also for setting aside of the order dated 19th January, 2005 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, dismissing the Criminal Revision Petition filed by the petitioners Brief facts of this case are that Petitioner Company, M/S. Hindustan Cables Ltd., Calcutta (for short as HCL) is a Govt. company. Petitioner Company issued a cheque in favour of the Respondent No.2 towards the supply of goods on 20.4.02. At the request of Respondent No.2, the aforesaid cheque was revalidated on 19.10.02 for six months. At the request and insistence of the Respondent No.2, the aforesaid cheque was once again revalidated on 18.4.03, subject to the condition that the same will be presented after confirmation from Petitioner Company.  When the aforesaid cheque was presented for payment, the same was dishonoured by the banker of the petitioner on the ground of 'exceeds arrangement' in the account of the petitioner and the same was communicated to the Respondent No.2 by their banker on 29.5.03. Then Respondent No.2 sent statutory legal notice under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Act to the petitioner company informing about the dishonour of the cheque in question and demanding payment of the amount covered by the cheque within fifteen days from the date of receipt of the said notice.  In response to the aforesaid statutory legal notice, petitioner company replied that the respondent no.2 suppressed the material fact that the cheque was issued subject to the condition that same would be presented after getting confirmation from HCL and BIFR had declared petitioner company as sick unit vide order dated 21.3.2003 and hence if the Respondent No.2 would proceed further, he would do so at his own cost risk.  Respondent no. 2, thereafter filed the complaint u/ss. 138/ 141 of the Act read with Ss.420/120B I.P.C. against the HCL and 13 others in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi.  On 21.4.05, the Petitioners filed the petition u/s.482 before this Court and the Court vide order dated 25.4.05 directed stay of the further proceedings in the Trial Court. The aforesaid petition was disposed off by this Court with liberty granted to the Petitioners to file fresh petition to challenge the summoning order to face trial for the offence u/ss.138/141 of the Act within 3 weeks challenging the summoning order dated 14.8.03 and granted stay of further proceedings. Hence, the petitioners have filed the present petition u/s.482, Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 before this Court.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and issued summons against the accused persons. The Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate vide order dated 24.8.2004 held that the accused is a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and the accused no.2 to 5 were public servants within the meaning of Sec. 21 of the Indian Penal Code, their prosecution was not maintainable without the written sanction as required u/s.197, Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 Thus, the Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate dropped the proceedings against accused no.2 to 5 for want of sanction. However, he rejected the application in respect of the remaining accused persons (Petitioners) and directed them to appear in person on the next date of hearing on 27.10.04.  Aggrieved thereby the Petitioners filed a Revision Petition before the Sessions Judge The Ld. Additional Sessions Judge observed that in view of the judgment passed by the Supreme Court in Adalat Prasad v. Rooplal Jindal and Others, 113 (2004) DLT 3562004 (113) DLT 3562004 ILO SC 666 (SC) and Subramanium Sethuraman v. State of Maharashtra and Another, 2004 (4) Crimes 782004 (4) Crimes 78 (SC), the only course of action available to the accused/petitioners by way of filing a Petition u/s.482, Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 before this Court against the order of the Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate relating to the summoning order. Accused persons have got no right to ask recalling of the summoning order either directly/indirectly by way of filing the Revision Petition; hence, dismissed the said Revision Petition being not maintainable in the eyes of law, without entering into the merits of the case.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: The main thrust of the arguments of the Ld. Counsel for the Petitioner Company is that the Petitioner Company is a govt. company. Directors and Person- in-Charge are responsible only for day-to-day affairs. There is no material gain to connect the petitioners with the alleged offence. 1. Further, on 21.3.03, the BIFR had declared the petitioner company as a 'Sick Industrial Company' in terms of Section 3 (1)(o) of the SICA and the company/ promoters were restrained u/s. 22A of SICA not to dispose of any fixed or current assets without the consent of the secured creditors and the BIFR. Because of the said restraint order passed by the BIFR, Petitioner Company had no authority to entertain the claim made by respondent no.2. Moreover, when the cheque was drawn, the restraint order was in force. Hence the instant criminal proceeding against the petitioners is not maintainable It is also contended that in view of the written undertaking, the Respondent No.2 had no authority to present the said cheque in the bank for encashment and the said written undertaking by the respondent no.2 amounts to an agreement and failure or refusal to abide by the stipulations contained in the said written undertaking amounts to a breach/violation which has rendered the said cheque an invalid instrument in the eyes of law. Thus, by presenting the said cheque in the bank for encashment without obtaining the consent of the petitioner company, the respondent no.2 acted illegally in utter violation of the condition of the agreement entered between him and the petitioner company. Hence it did not give rise to any cause of action to institute a prosecution against the petitioner company and its director or executive Director in accordance with law.\n**Argument by Respondent**: . The Ld. Counsel for the Respondent No. 2 on the other hand contends that on 21.3.03 the order was passed by the BIFR which finds mention of the reference made earlier by petitioners based on balance sheet as on 31.3.01 and the same was rejected as time barred on 26.7.02 and despite that they placed an order with the respondent no.2 for supply of goods by concealing these facts from the respondent no.2.\\n\\n16. It is further stated that the cheque were issued on 20.4.02 which was revalidated on 19.10.02 and lastly on 18.4.03. Again these facts were concealed by the petitioner company from the respondent no.2.  It is further contended that the BIFR passed directions to the petitioner company to make the payments for the running of the day-to-day business of the petitioner company. Therefore, a complete restraint was not placed upon the petitioner company for making the payment. The petitioner company is a running company and the raw material was supplied by the respondent no.2 for the running of the day-to-day business of the company. The cheque in question was issued by the petitioners for liability which is legally enforceable liability and was not issued for any loan and therefore, Sec.22A of the SICA is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the case.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: The Petitioner Company seek quashing of the complaint filed u/s.138 of the Act on the ground that since the offending company has been declared sick by the BIFR, no steps could be taken by the respondent no.2 (complainant) for realization of the amounts said to be due to them and therefore the criminal proceedings initiated against the petitioner company and its directors on the allegation that the cheque drawn in favour of the respondent no.2 was dishonoured by the bank is misconceived and should be quashed. Reliance has been placed on Sections 22 and 22A of SICA. .The petitioners have deliberately concealed the material facts that the operation of the bank accounts of the petitioner company has not been restrained by any order of BIFR.Other payments were made by petitioner company to Respondent no.2 and M/s. Shakun Polymers Ltd., shows that there was no restraint order by BIFR for payment of their liability to the customers/suppliers for day-to-day business. Section 22A of SICA, does not bar the criminal prosecution and payment of legally enforceable dues.\\n\\n20. Even if the said order of BIFR was passed on 21.3.03, it was not in accordance with law as it apparent from the said order that there was no scheme u/s.18 during the period of preparation of consideration or during the period beginning with the recording of opinion by the board or for winding up that the board under Section 20(1) and up to the commencement of the proceedings relating to the winding up before the High Court concerned, in the absence of both the conditions, the order under section22A of SICA is not in accordance with law. The offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act stood completed when there was a default and non-payment subsequent to the receipt of the statutory legal notice under section 138. It is the admitted case of both the parties that the amount is payable but the contention raised by petitioner company in its defence is that company is not in a position to pay. As regards the argument that the petitioner company has been declared sick by the BIFR and the company/ promoters were restrained u/s. 22A of SICA not to dispose of any fixed or current assets without the consent of the secured creditors and the BIFR, the facts of the present case show that despite that restraint order, the BIFR passed directions to the petitioner company to make the payments for the running of the day-to-day business of the petitioner company. The payment made by the petitioner company to the Respondent No.2 and M/s Shakun Polymers Ltd. also establish that there was no restraint order passed against the petitioner company by BIFR barring the payment of its liability to its customers/suppliers for the running of day-today business. In the explanation to the section clarification is made that the phrase 'debt or other liability' means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.  Further, the petitioner company had taken a written undertaking from the respondent no.2 that the cheque in question would not be presented for encashment in the bank without the consent of the petitioner company yet the revalidation letter has concealed about the restraint order made by the BIFR. Furthermore, there is no dispute that the present cheque was with respect to supply of the goods on 13.2.02, i.e. subsequent to the reference made by the petitioner company to the BIFR. These transactions were not restrained by BIFR.  In these facts and circumstances, thepurported undertaking was voidable under section 19 of Indian Contract Act, 1872 since there was concealment of facts on the part of the petitioner company.Keeping in mind the above discussions, the matter in dispute is a triable issue and can only be decided after placing the evidence before the Trial Court and the complaint cannot be quashed under section 482, Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "REJECTED\n\nThe core issue in this case is whether the lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is accurate, given that the statutory notice was issued beyond the prescribed period. The petitioner argues that the date of receipt of the information should be excluded, while the respondent contends that the first date should be included in the computation of the period of 30 days.\n\nThe lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint is not in accordance with the law. The Supreme Court decision in Econ Antri Limited vs. Rom Industries Limited and Another: 2014 11 SCC 769 : (AIR 2013 SC 3283) specifically held that the day on which the cause of action arises i.e. the date of receipt of information, should be excluded. This decision overrules the earlier conflicting judgment in Shiv Kumar vs. Natarajan: MANU/SC/1013/2009.\n\nThe petitioner's argument is more in line with the correct interpretation of the law. Therefore, the appeal should be allowed, and the complaint should not have been dismissed.\n\nIn conclusion, the lower court's decision is rejected, and the appeal is allowed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe present appeal has been preferred against the judgment dated 31.07.2014 whereby the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, Karkardooma Courts, New Delhi in complaint No. 266/13 has acquitted the respondent/accused of the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (NI Act). Background:  The case of the appellant/complainant, as narrated in the complaint is that the respondent/ accused purchased a property from him i.e. property bearing No. B-66, East Nathu Colony, Delhi-110094, and in the discharge of his liability, he made part payment in cash and also issued a cheque bearing No. 509034 dated 12.02.2006 amounting to Rs. 5,00,000/- drawn on Kangra Co-Operative Bank Ltd., A Block, JagatPuri, Delhi 110051, being the balance payment relating to the aforesaid purchase of property. The accused was summoned. Notice under Section 251 Cr PC was framed on 31.03.2009. The respondent pleaded \"not guilty\" and claimed trial. The said cheque was presented for encashment twice, and on both occasions, same was dishonoured with remarks \"insufficient funds\". The appellant served a legal demand notice dated 26.08.2006 to the respondent by courier as well as UPC, but even after receipt of the legal notice, the respondent did not make the payment. So, the present complaint was filed by the appellant under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. Before the Learned MM, the appellant Sh. Bhawish Chand Sharma examined himself as CW-1 in post notice evidence. Appellant filed his evidence by way of affidavit CW1/A. He also proved the cheque in question Ex. CW1/1, the cheque returning memo, Ex. CW1/2, envelope sent through the courier Ex. CW1/3, courier receipt Ex. CW1/4, UPC certificate Ex.CW1/5 and legal demand notice Ex. CW1/6. He also examined Parvesh Sharma, his son as CW-2. The appellant/ complainant in his cross examination stated that the property in question was sold to the respondent for a sum of Rs. 20,00,000/- out of which Rs. 15,00,000/- was received in cash and two cheques bearing no. 509032 and 509033 of Rs. 2,00,000/- each on Kangra bank was received at the time of registry. The registered sale deed Ex. CW1/ DA showed the value of the property as Rs.4,00,000/-. The two cheques received by the appellant/complainant amounting to Rs.4, 00,000/- in total have been mentioned in the sale deed. He further deposed that the amount of Rs.4,00,000/- was towards sale consideration and volunteered that Rs.1,00,000/- was for building material.  He, however, admitted that the presence of building material, and its sale to the accused for Rs.1,00,000/- was not mentioned in the sale deed; the legal notice, and; the complaint. After the conclusion of appellants post summoning evidence, statement of respondent was recorded u/s 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code on 21.03.2013, wherein the respondent/ accused stated that the complaint was false and frivolous. He also stated that on 07.02.2006, he had issued two cheques amounting to Rs. 2,00,000/- each - one in the name of the appellant and another in the name of wife of the appellant/complainant in consideration of the purchase amount relating to property bearing no. B- 66, East Nathu Colony, Delhi-94, which he had purchased from the appellant/complainant and his wife. Those cheques were shown to the Registrar also by the appellant/complainant at the time of the registration of documents relating to the said property. After the registration of documents, these cheques were returned to him by the appellant, as the sellers submitted that they did not have any bank account. On return of the same, he made a payment of Rs.4,00,000/- in cash to the appellant/complainant. The respondent stated that some electricity dues were remaining outstanding relating to the property in question. To provide a guarantee for payment of the same (as the appellant/complainant was not clearing his dues), he had issued a blank cheque containing his signature and the figure of Rs.5,00,000/- (not in words) to one Mr. Surender Kumar who was acting as an agent on behalf of the appellant in a Panchayat. The accused also chose to lead his evidence in his defence. He examined two witnesses. Sh. Malkeet Singh was examined as DW-1 and Sh. Kewal Singh was examined as DW-2. Malkeet Singh (DW-1) stated that after the agreement between the parties, some dispute arose regarding outstanding electricity dues. The complainant called one broker Surender Kumar for settling the dispute. Surender Kumar requested the complainant for some payment to him for making efforts to get the dispute settled.  On this, the respondent issued the cheque for Rs.5 lakhs in blank (the column meant for name was kept blank) to Surender Kumar on the same day, as security. He further deposed that after the registry, the respondent demanded his cheque of Rs.5 lakhs from Surender Kumar, and Surender Kumar replied that he has handed over the same to the appellant/ complainant. In response to a court question, he also stated that the demand for the cheque was made by the respondent from Surender Kumar in his presence during a meeting after the registry of the sale deed in his office. DW-1 was cross examined by the complainant. In his cross examination, he stated that he had no personal knowledge regarding the present dispute between the parties. He also admitted that he did not know Surender Kumar, but he had seen him one or two times. He did not know whether Surender Kumar was the middleman. He was not present when the sale deed was registered in the office of the Registrar. He did not have any knowledge regarding the amount of sale/ purchase in the sale transaction. He stated that the accused had told him that Surender Kumar had not returned the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs.  Kewal Singh, DW-2, inter alia, stated in his examination in chief that some electricity bills were remaining to be paid, amounting to around Rs.22 lakhs, which the complainant had agreed to clear. Regarding the same, a meeting was held in the year 2006 (probably) in the morning around 11:00 a.m. in his office. He gave the names of the persons who were present in the meeting, which included Surender Kumar. Surender Kumar stated that he had no faith in the complainant as to whether he will clear the bills or not. Surender Kumar demanded a cheque from the accused Bawa Singh. Accordingly, the cheque amounting to Rs.5 lakhs was given as security by the accused Bawa Singh to Surender Kumar. He stated that the cheque was written in words. He again said that the amount of Rs.5 lakhs was written in figure, and that nothing else was written on the cheque.  e stated that Surender Kumar promised to get the electricity bills cleared within the remaining period of one month of registry. But the bills could not be cleared for reasons not known to him. He stated that Surender Kumar got prepared a purported receipt from DESU regarding clearing of bills and the same was handed over by him to the complainant, who in turn handed over the same to the accused. The accused demanded back his cheque for Rs.5 lakhs in the meeting held on the same day as the registry of the sale deed, when Surender Kumar informed that the cheque had been handed over by him to the complainant. DW-2 was also cross examined. He stated that he had not seen the electricity bill amounting to Rs.22 lakhs himself. He had not seen any official from the electricity department visiting the property in question.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe submission of counsel for the appellant is that, admittedly, the accused had issued the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs under his signatures. If there was no obligation on the part of the accused to clear the alleged electricity dues, there was no reason for the accused to issue the same towards \"security\".  Moreover, the defence of the accused that he had replaced the two cheques of Rs.2 lakhs each (in aggregate Rs.4 lakhs) with cash payment is wholly unsubstantiated and not even probablised, since no receipt of payment of cash has been produced, and no witness to the said alleged payment has been produced by the accused. Pertinently, the accused himself also did not appear as his own witness while examining two other witnesses.  Learned counsel further submits that since the amount of Rs.4 lakhs by cheque was the apparent consideration disclosed in the sale deed, it is unbelievable that the accused would pay the said amount in cash without obtaining a receipt, and thereby jeopardise his sale transaction. Learned counsel has further submits that though DW-1 and DW-2 had stated that the accused was informed soon after the execution of the sale deed - that the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs allegedly delivered to Surender Kumar had been handed over by Surender Kumar to the complainant, the accused took no steps whatsoever either against the complainant, or the said Surender Kumar soon upon learning of the same. Learned counsel submits that the story set up by the accused to explain the issuance of cheque of Rs.5 lakhs is, therefore, completely unbelievable and not probablised. . So far as the issue of cheque of Rs.5 lakhs- in lieu of the two cheques of Rs.2 lakhs each is concerned, learned counsel for the appellant has argued that since the accused had himself issued the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs voluntarily (it is the defence of the accused that he had issued the said cheque of Rs.5 lakhs with the amount filled in), it was not necessary for the appellant to explain as to why the amount filled in the cheque was Rs.5 lakhs, and not Rs.4 lakhs.  In any event, the appellant had explained the same by stating that the additional amount of Rs.1 lakh was paid by the accused in respect of the construction material lying at the site of the property purchased by the accused from the appellant and his wife. . Learned counsel for the appellant submits that in the brief synopsis filed on behalf of the respondent in this Court, which is duly supported by the affidavit of the respondent dated 30.09.2016, he has himself explained that out of the total consideration of Rs.20 lakhs, Rs.15 lakhs had been paid in cash \"and on 12.03.2016 a sum of Rs.1 lac further in advance payment was made to the appellant just one day before the Registry and balance amount of Rs.4 lacs was paid by the respondent to the appellants by way of the two cheques 2 lacs each\".  Learned counsel points out that there is no evidence led by the accused to substantiate the plea that apart from Rs.15 lakhs paid in cash (which is acknowledged by the appellant), a further sum of Rs.1 lakh was paid in cash on 12.03.2016 i.e. one day before the registration of the sale deed. The said plea of payment of Rs. One Lakh on 12.03.2016 is not probabalised. In fact, this statement of the accused-duly supported by his affidavit, explains the issuance of the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs by the deceased.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent has argued that the impugned judgment does not call for interference, since the defence of the accused has been probablised and the guilt of the accused has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. The complainant has to stand on his own legs.  There are serious and gaping holes in the story of the appellant, since it is not explained as to why two cheques of Rs.2 lakhs each issued in the name of the appellant and his wife, were replaced by one cheque of Rs.5 lakhs drawn in favour of the appellant. Learned counsel submits that the electricity dues outstanding, as on the date of sale of the said property, are to the tune of Rs.22.466 lakhs. Thus, no amount is payable by the accused to the appellant. . Learned counsel further submits that the suit filed by the appellant, inter alia, to seek a declaration that the sale deed dated 13.03.2006 is null and void, and to seek a decree of possession in respect of the said property along with a decree of Rs.5.40 lakhs towards use and occupation charges of the suit property @ Rs.15,000/- per month with interest @ 24% per annum from 24.12.2007 to 23.12.2010, and to seek a decree of perpetual injunction against the accused was dismissed by the learned District Judge on 14.11.2014.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe learned M.M. rejected the complaint and acquitted the respondent. The Court held that the appellant/complainant failed to show that there existed any legal liability on the part of the respondent/accused for which the cheque was issued. The learned MM held that: i) Though the entire sale consideration was stated to be Rs.20 lakhs, the apparent sale consideration disclosed in the sale deed was only Rs.4 lakhs; ii) Though the complainant claimed that Rs.15 lakhs had been received in cash, and the balance outstanding was Rs.5 lakhs, he had accepted two cheques totalling to Rs.4 lakhs which were disclosed in the sale deed, thereby not explaining as to how the amount of Rs.1 lakh was sought to be recovered. iii) If the accused had been returned the two cheques of Rs.4 lakhs, then why would the accused replace the same with a cheque for Rs.5 lakhs, is not clear; iv) The complainant claimed the difference of Rs.1 lakh towards sale of the construction material lying on the ground floor of the building in question. However, this fact was not stated either in the sale deed, or in the legal notice, or even in the complaint;  v) The complainant stated in his cross examination that the cheque in question was given to him when he was alone. However, he examined his son CW-2 Pravesh Sharma, who stated that the cheque was given in his presence and in the presence of his mother and younger brother. CW-2 is not a witness to the sale deed Ex. CW- 1/DA.  Pertinently, the learned MM also rejected the defence of the accused that he had, in return for the two cheques of Rs.4 lakhs, paid Rs.4 lakhs in cash to the complainant. The learned MM also rejected the explanation furnished by the accused with regard to the issuance of the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs which bore his signature, as well as the amount of Rs.5 lakhs filled in.  The learned MM observed that the obligation to pay the electricity dues till the date of the sale deed was of the complainant. In this situation, there was no explicable reason as to why the accused would issue a cheque for Rs.5 lakhs as security to Mr. Surender Kumar for clearing/ settling the electricity dues. The said defence of the accused was held to be not believable as it was against the natural course of human behaviour and conduct.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Both counsels have relied upon case laws which shall be discussed later in this judgement. Judgment was initially reserved on 15.03.2017. While preparing the same, the Court felt the need to seek clarification on the aspect whether any outstanding electricity dues existed, as on the date of sale. Consequently, the matter was fixed to seek clarification on 09.01.2018. The respondent was directed to file an affidavit disclosing the electricity meter/ connection number being used by him along with the copy of the latest paid bill. The same was filed by the respondent. The appellant sought leave to place on record some additional documents obtained by him from the office of the electricity department/ company, to establish that there were no outstanding dues in respect of the electricity connection installed in the premises in question at the time of the sale to the respondent. The appellant was permitted to bring the said additional documents on record along with an additional affidavit. The appellant has also filed the said affidavit.Further arguments were heard in the matter on 07.02.2018, and judgment was reserved on the said date.. I have considered the submissions of learned counsels and also perused the affidavits filed by them in pursuance of the orders passed by me to seek clarification. I may, firstly, take note of the factual position as emerging on the record in relation to the existence of liability towards electricity dues as on the date of the sale deed. In the additional affidavit filed by the respondent- in compliance of the order dated 09.01.2018, the respondent states that the property was purchased by the appellant from one Gulzar Singh vide a general power of attorney/ agreement and will dated 20.11.1987 to the extent of 100 Sq.Yds. In respect of the remaining 100 Sq.Yds., a similar agreement was executed between Gulzar Singh and Smt. Shakuntala Devi- the wife of the appellant. The respondent states that as there were three electricity meters installed in the premises when the same was purchased by the appellant and his wife. The respondent claims that the DVB had issued a reminder in the name of Gulzar Singh, alleging that there was Fraudulent Abstraction of Electricity (FAE)/ direct theft dated 14.10.1999 in respect of the three electricity connections. The respondent further states that there was an outstanding electricity due of Rs.18,12,109.69/- which was reflected in the bill dated 13.01.2005 raised by the electricity supply company. He states that he had purchased the said property in the year 2006 from the complainant on \"as is where is basis\" wherein the said electricity meters were installed. He states that the complainant had failed to pay the outstanding amount, stating that he had cleared the bills issued in the name of his wife, and bills raised in his name would be cleared soon without burdening the respondent. He obtained a duplicate bill in respect of the meter in the name of Gulzar Singh, showing the outstanding dues as in June,\n\n2009. He claims that on his visit to the electricity enforcement department on 10.01.2018, he could not retrieve the information as the case filed relating to the meters is involved in many cases, and the information could not be divulged. He discloses that two electricity connections are installed in the premises presently- one in his name, and one in the name of Smt. Shakuntala. He has placed on record the bills raised by BSES Yamuna Power Ltd in respect of presently installed electricity connections. On the other hand, the appellant has filed his affidavit wherein he states that the electricity connections remained in the name of Gulzar Singh till the name was changed to that of Smt. Shakuntala in the month of March 2006. The appellant has placed on record copy of the bill raised in the name of Gulzar Singh in respect of last billing month \"February 2005\" and the bills generated in the name of Smt. Shakuntala, thereafter. He submits that the said bills do not show any arrears of electricity dues under any head whatsoever, much less on account of FAE or direct theft. He submits that all the electricity dues/ bills were paid from time to time. He has also placed on record the \"No Objection Certificate\" issued by BSES Yamuna Power Ltd. in respect to the electricity connection obtained by Gulzar Singh, which clearly states that no dues are pending against the said electricity connections.From the documents filed by the respondent, and the documents filed by the appellant, and the statements made by them in their respective affidavits, it is absolutely clear that the respondent has merely raised a bogie of there being some outstanding electricity dues from the time when Gulzar Singh occupied the property in question. There is absolutely no basis for the same. It is not the case of the respondent that the electricity supply company i.e., BSES Yamuna Power Ltd. has raised any demand in respect of the electricity meters installed in his premises, ever since he came in occupation of the same. He has never faced any threat of disconnection on account of the alleged outstanding dues. Electricity bills raised by supply company for December 2017, which are placed on record do not show any outstanding arrears. They are based on the actual consumption of electricity for the previous month. It is not the defence of the respondent accused that the electricity company has taken any steps against him- as the user of the electricity connections in the premises, or his property, to recover the so called dues of Rs. 18,12,109.69/-, or any such amount. On the other hand, the appellant has clearly shown from the documents placed on record that there were no outstanding dues in respect of the electricity connection obtained by Gulzar Singh. After the transfer of the connections, the electricity bills raised in the name of Smt. Shakuntala were regularly paid. BSES Yamuna Power Ltd. has also issued a certificate, certifying that there are no electricity dues of BYPL outstanding in respect of K No. 12600B090002, and that he is free to surrender the said electricity connection, on 18.09.2006. The electricity dues of Gulzar Singh, in any event, would be barred by limitation in view of the judgment of this Court in H.D. Shourie v. Delhi Municipal Corporation AIR 1987 DEL 219.Having clarified the factual position by taking the evidence on record, I now proceed to discuss the rival submissions of the parties.The appellant claims that out of a sale consideration of Rs. 20,00,000/-, he received Rs.15,00,00/- in cash. According to him the balance outstanding was Rs.5,00,000/-. The fact that the actual sale consideration was 20 lakhs is also admitted by the respondent, as is evident from his brief synopsis which is supported by his affidavit. The relevant portion of the said brief synopsis has been extracted hereinabove in paragraph 16. Pertinently, in his supporting affidavit dated 30.09.2016, the respondent states:\"2. That the said brief synopsis on behalf of the respondent Sh. Bawa Singh has been drafted by my counsel at my instance and under my instructions and I have understood the meaning and implications of the facts set out and averments made therein in my vernacular and also in the vernacular in which it is written and say that the facts stated therein are correct and the same are not being reproduced herein for the sake of brevity and in order to avoid repetition and are urged as part and parcel of this affidavit\".29. However, the sale deed Ex.CW1/DA, records the sale consideration as Rs.4,00,000/- only. As per the sale deed the said amount was paid to the appellant by two cheques of Rs. 2,00,000/- each. It is the defence of the accused that he had taken back the said two cheques of Rs.2,00,000/- each from the appellant. Therefore, even according to him, the said two cheques of Rs.2,00,000/- each were not encashed by the appellant or his wife. He claims that he had made payment of Rs.4,00,000/- in cash to the appellant. Pertinently, there is no receipt or acknowledgment produced by him evidencing payment of the said amount. The appellant had denied having received the said amount in cash. Apart from the respondent's ipse dixit, there is nothing to substantiate the said position. I agree with the submission of Ld. Counsel for the appellant that, had the amount of Rs.4,00,000/- been paid in cash by the respondent, he would have obtained a receipt for the same, since that was the disclosed consideration in the sale deed and he would not have put his sale deed in jeopardy by letting the said transaction of payment of cash go unacknowledged. Pertinent, the Ld. MM has also rejected this defence of the accused. Pertinently, even the ADJ while rendering the judgment dated 14.11.2014 in CS.OS 01/2011 preferred by the appellant, has returned the finding that the defendant i.e, the respondent accused \"has issued consolidated cheque of Rs Five Lacs after receiving two cheques of Rs. Two lacs each. Hence, the sale deed executed by the plaintiffs in favour of the defendant in respect of the suit property is without any sale consideration. The defendant has failed to prove that he had paid the sale consideration amount in cash to the plaintiffs. Accordingly, both the issues are decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.\" It is a different matter that the appellants suit was dismissed on the ground that the same was barred by limitation. Despite finding the defence of the accused to be unbelievable, the Ld. Magistrate acquitted the respondent on account of an apparent discrepancy in the case of the appellant. Ld. MM held that out of the sale consideration of Rs.20,00,000/-, the complainant claimed to have received only 15,00,000/- in cash. Thus, the outstanding balance was Rs.5,00,000/-. Even then the complainant accepted two cheques - totaling to Rs.4,00,000/- only. The appellant had not disclosed as to how the remaining amount of Rs.1,00,000/- was sought to be recovered from the respondent accused. The Ld. MM also held that if the accused had been returned the two cheques of Rs.2,00,000/- , then why would he replace the same with a cheque of Rs.5,00,000/-. The complainant had claimed that the amount of Rs.1,00,000/- was towards the sale of building material lying on ground floor of the building in question. However, that fact was not stated in the sale deed, legal notice, or even in the complaint. The complainant had stated that the cheque of Rs.5,00,000/- was given to him when he was alone. However, CW2 Parvesh Sharma- the son of the complainant stated that the said cheque was given in his presence and in the presence of his mother and the younger brother.Having considered the evidence brought on record, and the Brief Synopsis filed by the respondent along with his supporting affidavit dated 30.09.2016, in my view, the reasons recorded by the Ld. MM to disbelieve the complaint of the complainant are not germane. It is evident that the parties had agreed to disclose consideration of Rs.4,00,000/- in the sale deed out of the total consideration of Rs.20 lakhs. This is evident from the sale deed itself, and from the fact that two cheques of Rs.2,00,000/- were drawn by the accused and shown before the sub Registrar. However, it appears that it was never the intention of the parties that the said cheques of Rs.2,00,000/- each would be delivered to the drawees and encashed by them. Admittedly, the said cheques were returned to the accused. Though he claims that he had made payment of Rs.4,00,000/- in cash, that story is completely unbelievable. As noticed above, the respondent has claimed in his Brief Synopsis that \"the total consideration of the property in question is Rs.20 lacs in which Rs.15 lacs has been paid in cash and on 12.3.2016 a sum of Rs.1 lac further in advance payment was made to the appellant just one day before the Registry and balance amount of Rs.4 lacs was paid by the respondent to the appellants by way of the two cheques 2 lacs each\". He is bound by this statement, duly supported by his affidavit. However, there is nothing to substantiate - not even probabalise, his stand that he had paid Rs.One Lakh in cash \"on 12.03.2016\" i.e. one day before the Registry. Pertinently, the Sale Deed was got registered on 14.03.2006. Thus, there is nothing to substantiate that the respondent had made any payment to the petitioner, other than the amount of Rs.15 lakhs. Thus, there is no inconsistency in so far as the case of the complainant is concerned that he has received Rs.15,00,000/- and had to receive the balance of Rs.5,00,000/The respondent claimed to have issued the cheque in question to one Surender Kumar for clearing the electricity dues of the premises which, according to him, were to be cleared by the appellant. The explanation furnished by the respondent, to say the least, is absurd. If the appellant had to clear the said dues, there was no reason for the respondent to issue the cheque of Rs.5,00,000/- and leave it with Surender Kumar. The position would have been to the contrary. It is the appellant, who would have had to create a security in favour of the respondent to ensure that he clears the outstanding electricity dues. It is also pertinent to note that the Ld. MM has rejected the explanation furnished by the accused for issuance of the cheque of Rs.5,00,000/- which admittedly bears his signatures.. Thus, it is evident that the cheque of Rs.5,00,000/- was issued by the respondent towards the balance sale consideration. May be, the same was left with Surender Kumar, till such time as the appellant satisfies the respondent with regard to the apprehended outstanding electricity bills, whereafter, the balance payment of Rs.5,00,000/- was to be handed over to the appellant. Only this arrangement explains issuance of the said cheque of Rs.5,00,000/- by the respondent and its being handed over to a third party, namely, Surender Kumar - as claimed by the respondent. Pertinently, the accused and his witnesses claimed that Surender Kumar had informed that he had handed over the cheque of Rs. 5,00,000/- given to him as security by respondent, to the appellant, after the registration of the documents. Thus, as per the defence of the accused, Surender Kumar breached the trust and faith in which the said cheque of Rs.5,00,000/- was delivered by him to Surender Kumar. Yet, no action of any nature was taken by the respondent against Surender Kumar. No notice was issued to- either Surender Kumar, or to the appellant, claiming that the said cheque had unlawfully been delivered by Surender Kumar to the appellant. No demand was made by the respondent for return of the said cheque. Pertinently, no stop payment instructions were issued in respect of the said cheque to the bank, even after learning of its so called alleged unlawful delivery by Surender Kumar to the appellant.The cross examination of DW1 and DW2 have exposed them as unreliable witnesses. DW1 stated that he had no personal interest regarding the dispute between the parties. He did not know the middleman Surender Kumar. He did not even know that Surender Kumar was a middleman. He was not present when the sale deed was registered in the office of the Registrar. He did not have any knowledge regarding the amounts of the sale/ purchase under the transaction. Similarly, DW2 stated that he had not seen the electricity bill amounting to Rs.22,00,000/-, allegedly raised by DESU towards the outstanding dues, himself. He had not seen any official from the electricity department visiting the property in question. Pertinently, the respondent neither examined himself, nor the said Surender Kumar to probabalise his defence.The explanation furnished by the complainant that the amount of Rs.1,00,000/- was towards the sale of building material lying on the ground floor of the premises was not necessary to be gone into. As to how the parties decided on the consideration under the transaction, and what all went into it, is not the concern of the court. What is relevant and material is that the total sale consideration was Rs.20 lakhs.The defence set up by the respondent accused is most implausible. This court in Rajesh Agarwal v. State and Anr., 2010 VII AD (Delhi) 576 has observed as under: \"There is no presumption that even if an accused fails to bring out his defence, he is still to be considered innocent. If an accused has a defence against dishonour of the cheque in question, it is he alone who knows the defence and responsibility of spelling out this defence to the court and then proving this defences is on the accused\".The above extracted observations made by the Courts squarely apply in the facts of the present case. Learned counsel for the respondent has, firstly, relied upon the order passed by this court in Saj Properties Pvt. Ltd. v. Virender Dagar, 2015 Cri LJ 2772. Pertinently, this was an order rejecting the petitioner's leave petition to seek leave to appeal against the acquittal of the respondent/ accused in the complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act. In that case, in the complaint as well as in the pre-summoning evidence/ examination in chief, the petitioner did not disclose as to on what account the legally recoverable debt had arisen. It was only in the legal notice issued by the complainant, he stated that the accused had taken a friendly loan and that in discharge thereof the cheque of Rs.12 lakhs had been issued.In my view, the said decision is of no avail to the respondent, since it has been the consistent claim of the appellant that the cheque in question was issued towards discharge of the liability of Rs.5 lakhs payable under the sale transaction.There can be no quarrel with the aforesaid proposition. It will have to be examined from case to case as to whether the accused has set up a probable defence. Order accordingly",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "**Expected Output:**\n1. The main issue of the case is whether the respondent has committed an offence under section 138 of the NI Act for dishonouring a cheque issued for payment of the sale consideration of a property. The lower court acquitted the respondent after finding that the appellant failed to show a legal liability on the part of the respondent for which the cheque was issued, and that the respondent's defence was believable.\n2. Critically assessing the lower court's judgment, we need to determine if the respondent's actions constitute an offence under section 138 of the NI Act and if the appellant has proven his case beyond all reasonable doubt. We must also evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and the accused's defence, assess the appellant's claims regarding the sale consideration and electricity dues outstanding, and determine if the respondent had a legal liability for which the cheque was issued.\n    a. The respondent issued a cheque of Rs.5 lakhs, which was dishonoured, for payment of the sale consideration of a property. The lower court found that the total sale consideration was Rs.20 lakhs, of which Rs.15 lakhs were received in cash and the remaining Rs.4 lakhs was to be paid through two cheques of Rs.2 lakhs each. The respondent replaced these two cheques with a cash payment of Rs.4 lakhs. The appellant argues that the respondent had issued the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs as security for clearing the electricity dues outstanding, but the respondent claims that the cheque was issued in return for the two cheques of Rs.4 lakhs which were disclosed in the sale deed, and that the additional amount of Rs.1 lakh was paid in cash one day before the registration of the sale deed.\n    b. The appellant has presented evidence to prove his case, including the cheque issued by the respondent, the legal notice, and the complaint filed. The respondent has also filed an affidavit explaining his payment of Rs.1 lakh on 12.03.2016, one day before the registration of the sale deed. However, the appellant argues that the respondent's explanation is not probablised as there is no evidence to support the payment of Rs.1 lakh on 12.03.2016, and the respondent's affidavit is not duly supported by any documents or witnesses.\n    c. The respondent's defence is that the appellant had a legal obligation to pay the electricity dues outstanding till the date of sale deed, and there was no legal liability on the part of the respondent for which the cheque was issued. The respondent has presented evidence to support his defence, including a synopsis and an affidavit explaining his payment of Rs.1 lakh on 12.03.2016, one day before the registration of the sale deed.\n    d. The respondent's explanation for issuing the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs is that it was issued as security for clearing the electricity dues outstanding, and the additional amount of Rs.1 lakh was paid in cash one day before the registration of the sale deed. The respondent claims that the cheque was issued in return for the two cheques of Rs.4 lakhs which were disclosed in the sale deed, and that the additional amount of Rs.1 lakh was paid in cash one day before the registration of the sale deed. The respondent's explanation is supported by his affidavit, and the appellant has not produced any evidence to contradict this.\n    e. The lower court has found that the respondent's explanation for issuing the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs is believable, and that there is no legal liability on the part of the respondent for which the cheque was issued. The lower court has also found that the respondent's defence is not weak due to the dismissal of the appellant's suit.\n3. Based on the above analysis, it appears that the lower court has applied the relevant legal provisions and has arrived at a well-reasoned decision. The appellant's case is not proven beyond all reasonable doubt, and the respondent's explanation for issuing the cheque of Rs.5 lakhs is believable. Therefore, the appellate court should uphold the lower court's decision and dismiss the appeal filed by the appellant."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n2. The petitioner is facing a complaint filed by the respondent under Section 138, 141 & 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on the allegations that the petitioner issued a cheque of Rs. 60 lacs in favour of the respondent for valid consideration. The said cheque bearing no. 784074 dated 30.09.1994 was dishonored on presentation by the bankers of the petitioners with the remarks \"funds insufficient\". The complainant/ respondent then issued a legal notice to the petitioner dated 07.10.1994 informing the petitioner about the dishonor of the aforesaid cheque and calling upon him to pay the amount of cheque within a period of 15 days of the receipt of said legal notice. Since the petitioner failed to make the payment, the respondent after waiting for the statutory period of 30 days filed a complaint in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate in which the petitioner was summoned to face the trial. 3. Before filing the aforesaid complaint the respondent also made a complaint to the CBI on 23.06.1995 against the petitioner & 3 others and on that basis an FIR was registered by the CBI bearing No. RC 50 (A)/95-DLI. The said complaint reads as under:\n\n\"The Superintendent of Police, CBI, Anti Corruption Branch-I, Block 4, C.G.O. Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi-3. Sir, this is to bring to your notice on 21.3.1994 Shri Vijay Borar of Borar & Co., Chartered Accountant, New Delhi approached us for discounting a trade bill of exchange of Rs. 60 lacs drawn by Kay Bee & Co., on Radhika Leather Fashions, New Delhi with the proposal of Mr. Borar as looking to the amount of the bill we wanted to collateral security. Mr. Borar assured that this bill and the obligations there under would be met with on due date because he had arranged a confirmation from the Chief Manager, State Bank of Saurashtra, Lodhi Road affirming the commitment of meeting obligation by the Bank on due date also. The bill of exchange was accepted and co-accepted for payment by Mr. R.P.Mathur, Prop. Radhika Leather Fashions and the Chief Manager, State Bank kof Saurashtra. State Bank of Saurashtra also issued a certificate dated 24.3.1994 confirming that Mr. R.P.Mathur, Prop. Radhika Leather Fashions has a running Credit limit of Rs. 2075 crores with the Bank and the amount will be paid on due date. Further, on 30.3.1994, the Chief Manager of Saurashtra conformed to us that the payment will be made on the due date i.e. 30.9.1994. On the basis of aforesaid representation and assurance by Mr. Vijay Borar, Mr. R.P.Mathur, the Chief Manager of State Bank of Saurashtra we discounted the aforesaid bill of exchange. ON 3.9.1994 the bill of exchange was due for payment but on presentation the cheque given to us for making repayment on the bill was dishonoured and when we tried to meet Mr. R.P.Mathur, of RAdhika Leather Fashions we were told that he is out of India. Mr. Vijay Borar told us that State Bank of Saurashtra being the co-acceptor is bound for their commitment but despite our best efforts no payment was made by Bank of Saurashtra. Again we along with the Notary Public approached the Bank and requested for payment against the bill of exchange, but no payment was made and even Bank of Saurashtra refused to accept the legal notice. Thus, it is apparent that the gang of four viz. Mr. V.B.Borar of Borar & Co., and Chief Manager of State Bank of Saurashtra jointly conspired and connived to commit fraud on our company with an intention to cheat our Company and misappropriate the amount of Rs. 60 lacs amongst themselves and succeeded in their motives. We request you to kindly take immediate action against the culprits.\" 4. In the above said case FIR and also a challan has been filed and the matter is pending investigation and trial before the Court after the filing of the Complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. ACT.\"\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n6. The Petitioner has submitted that while filing the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 the respondent has not brought to the notice of the Court that he has also filed a complaint with the CBI and, thus, concealed material facts. It is also submitted that on comparative study of the complaint made by Respondent to CBI, and the averments made in complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, it is clear that cheque in question is the foundation of both the cases emanating and originating out of series of same acts and transaction which are also subject matter of above referred CBI case and is not a case simplicitor of payment/discharge of liability of debt. It is submitted that continuation of the complaint despite filing of a challan by the CBI on the basis of FIR on the complaint of the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 tantamount to prosecuting the petitioner at two places for the same cause of action and amounts to double jeopardy. It is also submitted that the Magistrate wrongly dismissed his application for recalling the summons. It has been submitted that for the same cause of action two different Courts cannot proceed with the trial. 7. The petitioner has also alleged that even otherwise the complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is liable to be quashed, because in the complaint filed in the aforementioned complaint the respondent has not disclosed the true facts and that facts narrated in complaint under Section 420 Indian Penal Code, 1860 which render the averments made in complaint as false. Moreover, the subject cheque is without consideration and is stated to have been issued to back up the bill of exchange which was co-accepted by State Bank of Saurashtra who certified the cheque as good for payment and therefore it was the said bank who was the accused and not the Petitioner. Resultantly ingredients of Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are not made out and as such, complaint under Section 138 is neither competent nor maintainable.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n8. In the counter affidavit filed by the respondent/complainant it has been submitted that the petition filed by the petitioner is mala-fide and without any merits. It is stated that the inherent powers of this Court can only be exercised in circumstances which are rarest for the purpose of meeting the ends of justice, and it is not a case where such interference is called for. Relying upon the judgment of the Apex Court, delievered in the case of Dhariwal Tobaco Products Ltd. and Ors. Vs. State Of Maharashtra & Anr 2008 (16) SCALE 240, it has been submitted that the powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can only be exercised in a deserving case within parameters of law whereas in the present case nothing has been shown by the respondent that there is any reason to exercise such powers and therefore it has been prayed that the petition be dismissed with costs. . It has also been submitted that while exercising powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 this Court cannot act as a Court of Appeal inasmuch as by the present petition the petitioner only wants to assail the order passed by the Learned Metropolitan Magistrate in complaint case no. 865/2001 dated 15.03.2004. 9. Dealing with the submissions made by the petitioner relying upon the Article 20(2) of the Constitution Of India, 1950 alleging double jeopardy just because he is called upon to face the prosecution based upon the FIR registered by the CBI and to meet the allegation made in the complaint it has been averred that it is not a case where the petitioner is being tried for the same offence in two different forums. It is submitted that the charges against the petitioner as recited in the FIR are distinct and different from the offence said to have been committed by the petitioner on account of the cheque having been issued by him getting dishonored on presentation. Admittedly, the petitioner has been charged under Section 420, 477A read with Section 120 B of Indian Penal Code, 1860 in the FIR registered against him whereas he has been prosecuted under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 before the Trial Court on the same set of facts. Moreover, it is further submitted that the petitioner at no point of time had denied the issuance of cheque, the dishonoring of the Cheque which triggered the criminal prosecution before the Trial Court. It is also stated that in view of the issuance of cheque by the petitioner, the presumption under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 comes into operation which can only be rebutted during the course of the Trial and cannot be decided in a proceedings under Section 482 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It is also submitted that the second prosecution on similar set of facts are not barred if the ingredients of the two offences are distinct. Respondent also stated that the rule against double jeopardy is manifested in Section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, Section 300 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and Section 71 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which unequivocally held initiation of prosecution on the same set of facts provided these fulfill the ingredients of offences distinct and different. It is submitted that both the complaints against the petitioner though are emanating from the same set of facts but they do fulfill the vital and mandatory requirement for the purpose of launching prosecution against the petitioner for two distinct offences. Moreover the prayer sought by the petitioner is not borne out from the facts recited in the petition as the prayer in terms of clause B is not a subject matter before this Court and it unambiguously manifests the ulterior objective of the petitioner to resort to dilatory tactics by raising objections extraneous and frivolous in nature.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n1. By way of the present petition the petitioners have invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court vested in this Court under Section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and have made the following prayers:\n\na) quash criminal complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against Petitioner pending before the Court of Ms Anuradha Shukla, MM, New Delhi entitled as \"SRP Industries Ltd vs. R P Mathur, Prop. Radhika Leather Fashions\".\n\nb) and/or alternatively quash warrant case emanating out of FIR No. RC, 50 (A)/95-DLI dated 23.6.1995 with Central Bureau of Investigation;\n\nc) and/or otherwise pass such further orders and grant relief that the Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper under the facts and circumstances of the case. 5. After the receipt of the summons in the complaint subject matter of this petition the petitioner filed an application before the Metropolitan Magistrate for recalling of the summoning order in the said complaint bearing No. 865/01 which as stated above is the Complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which has been dismissed vide order dated 15.03.2004. It has been held that the proceedings taken out by the respondents under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and the complaint registered by the CBI makes out two independent set of offences which are distinct and as such there was no occasion to recall of the summons under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Relevant observations made in the aforesaid order are reproduced hereunder:\n\n12. In the instant matter admittedly although a FIR has been registered the accused under Section 420/477A/120B Indian Penal Code, 1860, the trial in the said case is still going on and accused has neither been convicted or acquitted as yet and as such the applicability of double jeopardy cannot be pleaded in the facts of the instant case. Even if this aspect is not considered at this stage, in view of the categorical judgment of the Apex Court in the judgments cited by the Ld. Counsel for the complainant, it has been specifically held that where the ingredients of two offences are different, the prosecution in the two cases can be held separately in spite of the fact that the two offences emanate from the same transaction\n\n13. In the case in hand, the applicant is asserting that in view of FIR registered against him under Section 420/477A/120B Indian Penal Code, 1860, the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is not maintainable. However, a bare perusal of the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 would indicate that it has very specific ingredients as specified herein above being issuance of cheque, dishonor thereof, issuance of legal notice and filing of complaint within the period of limitation. However, section 420/477A/120B Indian Penal Code, 1860 requires the element of dishonesty, inducement, falsification, fraud etc.\n\n14. Thus a bare perusal of the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and Section 420/477/120B would reveal that the accused ingredients of the two offences are distinct and as such in view of the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court cited hereinabove, the prosecution of the accused under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 cannot be considered to be barred by the prosecution under section 420/477/120B Indian Penal Code, 1860 in State cases as regards the arguments of Ld. Counsel regarding cheque having not been issued for valid consideration, Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is very clear when it lays down that there shall be presumption in favour of complainant if the cheque is issued in his favour that the same was issued for valid consideration. The accused if he alleges that there was no valid consideration can rebut the allegation at the stage of trial. However, this cannot be considered as this stage a ground for recalling the summons.\n",
    "Case_Result": "11. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions. A bare perusal of thecomplaint on the basis of which an FIR has been registered by the CBI goes to show that the offences for which the petitioner and others have been put in that case are not on account of dishonouring of cheque of Rs. 60 lacs but for cheating the complainant in seeking discounting of a trade bill for exchange of Rs. 60 lacs drawn by Kay Bee & Co., on Radhika Leather Fashions, New Delhi for which a collateral security was arranged from the Chief Manager State Bank of Saurashtra. It is on the basis of the aforesaid commitment the bill of exchange was accepted and co-accepted for payment by Mr. R.P.Mathur, Prop. Radhika Leather Fashions and the Chief Manager State Bank of Saurashtra for which a certificate was also issued on 24.03.2005 confirming that the R.P.Mathur, Proprietor Radhika Fashion had a running credit limit of Rs. 2.75 crores and as such the amount will be paid on due date and an assurance was given that when the Bills will be presented they will be honoured. However, on 03.09.1994 when the bill of exchange was due for payment and a cheque was given to the complainant for making repayment that bill was dishonoured. Thus, thecomplaint is based upon a false assurance that the bill of exchange would be accepted on presentation which was not done. The assurance that petitioner was having a credit limit for State Bank of Saurashtra as confirmed by the said bank was also found to be false. The fact of dishonour of the cheque constitute a separate offence in view of the provisions contained under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881which provides for a separate/additional remedy in respect of dishonouring of the cheque so as to save the commercial transactions and to grant some kind of protection to the people who relies upon payment made by way of cheques.12. I have also gone through the judgment relied upon by the petitioner in the case of G. Sagar Suri & Anr. Vs. State of U.P and Others (supra) but find that the judgment is not of any help to the petitioner on the facts of this case. Rather this case helps the respondent. In the said case it was held that:\n\n\"10. the inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim or caprice and that statutory power has to be exercised sparingly, with circumspection and in the rarest of rare cases. \"\"14. Even otherwise the plea of Double Jeopardy is pre-mature because in this case, the petitioner has not yet been convicted in either of the cases. The plea of double jeopardy can be only be invoked when a person is convicted for the same offence twice15. Having perused the order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate which has also been challenged in this petition I find that there is absolutely no infirmity in the said order because the learned trial Court has brought the distinction between the two set of offences and has rightly dealt with the issue raised of double jeopardy which in this case is not applicable.16. I also agree with the submissions made by the respondents that it is not a case where provisions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can be invoked.This extract is taken from State of Bihar v. Murad Ali Khan, (1988) 4 SCC 655, at page 666 :18. In the same judgment the Apex Court also relied upon another judgment delivered in the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs. R.K. Rohtagi (1983) 1 SCC 1 where it was said: Petition dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9734\n**Facts**: 2. Petitioners and the complainant (respondent No. 2 herein) had business dealings with each other for sale and purchase of papers and stationery products. Respondent No.2 had maintained a running account of the petitioner in its books of accounts. Petitioners issued cheque No. 003690 dated 1.6.2005 for a sum of Rs.1, 49, 474/- drawn on Lord Krishna Bank against bill No. 3103 raised by the respondent. This cheque, on presentation to the Bank, was dishonoured with the remarks \"insufficient funds\" vide Memo dated 5.7.2005. A legal notice dated 22.07.2005 was served upon the petitioners by the respondent. This notice was duly replied by the petitioners through their Advocate on 5.8.2005. Since petitioners failed to make payment of the dishonoured cheque despite serving the aforesaid notice, a complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") was filed by the respondent. \n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 1. Impugning the order of the trial court dated 31.08.2005 and consequent notice under Section 251 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 'Cr.P.C'.) dated 10.04.2007, present petition has been filed by the petitioners seeking quashing of Criminal Complaint; case No. 1327/1 of 2005 filed by respondent No. 2 against the petitioners. On the basis of pre-summoning evidence, trial court took cognizance of the offence and summoned the petitioners vide his order dated 30.08.2005. On appearance of the petitioners in the Court, the Court served notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C. upon the petitioner on 10.04.2007.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: 3. Petitioners have challenged the maintainability of the complaint as well as the order of the trial court dated 31.08.2005 and the notice dated 10.04.2007 on the grounds that petitioners had already made payment of the impugned cheque even before the receipt of legal demand notice and no cause of action survived in favour of the respondent for filing the complaint under Section 138 of the Act. 4. It is argued by Mr. Pankaj Seth, learned counsel for the petitioners that two cheques for Rs. 2, 98, 948/- and Rs. 1, 49, 474/- being cheque Nos. 003686 and 003690 respectively were issued in favour of respondent No.2 by the petitioners against the dishonoured cheque No. 003690 for payment of bill No. 3103 and the respondents had already received the payment of the said cheques even before the notice dated 22.07.2005 was served upon the petitioners by the respondents through their Advocate. Since payment had already been received by the respondent against the impugned dishonoured cheque; the respondents, suppressing this vital fact, filed the complaint with a view to harass the petitioners and to pressurize them to extort some undue money from the petitioners. 6. In their reply dated 5.8.2005, the petitioners have specifically stated that the impugned cheque was a post dated cheque issued in favour of the respondent on an assurance that the said cheque would be presented after intimation and sufficient notice to the petitioners. It is also specifically stated in the reply that the amount of the impugned cheque was paid by way of two pay orders for a total sum of Rs. 4, 48, 422/- which included payment of Bill No. 3103. Relevant paras of the reply read as follows:\\n\\n\"3-5. With reference to the contents of para 3 to 5 of your legal notice, we have been instructed to inform you that our clients were willing to make immediate payment and it was only at the request of your clients post dated cheques were issued by our clients in favor of your clients. The same were given upon assurance of your clients that the same will be presented after intimation and sufficient notice to our clients. In fact we on behalf of our clients wish to inform you that two cheques of Rs.2, 98, 948/- and Rs. 149, 474/- being cheque No. \"003686\" and \"003690\" respectively were issued to your clients by our clients at their request. The aforesaid cheque no. \"003690\" was issued against Bill No. 3103.\\n\\n7. Our clients upon intimation of dishonor of cheques from its bank immediately instructed its bankers to issue 2 pay orders in favor of your clients. The same being Pay Order No. \"195429\" drawn on Corporation Bank amounting to Rs.2, 60, 000/- and Pay Order No. \"1515\" drawn on Lord Krishna Bank amounting to Rs.1, 88, 422/- both dated 22.06.05 have been since handed over to your clients who have duly acknowledged its receipt and appropriated the said amounts without any protest.\"\n**Argument by Respondent**: 5. Mr. M.K. Shah, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has submitted that a running account was maintained by the respondent regarding the business transactions with the petitioners and in the ledger account, the payments, when received from the petitioners, were duly credited in their account; since a running account was maintained, the payment received from the petitioners by way of pay order No. 195429 drawn on Corporation Bank amounting to Rs. 2, 60, 000/- and pay order No. 1515 drawn on Lord Krishna Bank for Rs. 1, 88, 422/- both dated 22.06.2005 were credited in the account of the petitioners and duly accounted for. These payments in no manner could be treated to have been made against the dishonoured cheque; the respondent was within its rights to file the complaint on the basis of the dishonoured cheque which was for due consideration.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 7. The petitioners, therefore, denied any liability to pay a sum of Rs.1, 49, 474/- being the amount of the dishonoured cheque No. 003690. Petitioners had raised this defence before the trial court and they produced the receipt of the above said pay orders before the court with a copy to the counsel for respondent No. 2. Counsel for respondent No. 2 took adjournments for verification and thereafter for filing some documents show that receipt of the payment made by petitioner No. 2 was inadvertently issued by the concerned record clerk of the respondent. Despite having taken adjournments, respondent No. 2 failed to submit in the court any verification report of the receipt and also failed to file the documents indicating the circumstances in which the said receipt was issued. Under these circumstances, the receipt dated 22.06.2005 becomes relevant and crucial document for the court to consider if, the payment of the impugned cheque was duly made by the petitioners by way of two pay orders. 8. Execution of this receipt by Amit Bansal, an employee of the respondent is not in dispute. This receipt is addressed to the petitioners duly signed by Amit Bansal for respondent No. 2. The contents of the receipt are reproduced as below:\\n\\n\"........Thanks to received 2 pay orders for the amount Rs. 2, 60, 000/- No. 195429, Drawn on Corpn. Bank, G.K.II & Rs. 1, 88, 422/- No. 1515 drawn on Lord Krishna Bank, Kalkaji, Total Rs.448422/- against ch.nos. 003686 & another Ch.No.-003690 for Rs. 1, 49, 474 in favour of M/s. KCT & Bros (c.s.) Ltd. Total amount Rs. 448422/-..........\" 9. Bare reading of this receipt makes it clear that two pay orders being pay order No. 195429 for Rs. 2, 60, 000/- drawn on Corporation Bank, G.K.II and another pay order No. 1515 drawn on Lord Krishna Bank, Kalkaji for Rs. 1, 88, 422/- were admittedly received by the respondent as payment against cheque Nos. 003686 for Rs. 2, 98, 948/- and cheque No. 003690 for Rs. 1, 49, 474/-, the total amount being Rs. 4, 48.422/-. Both these pay orders have been got encashed by the respondents. The impugned cheque was issued against Bill No. 3103. As per this receipt, the payment of the impugned cheque was immediately made to the respondent when petitioners came to know that the said cheque on presentation was dishonoured. 10. The acknowledgement receipt bonafidely issued by a responsible officer of the respondent company on the letter head of the company cannot be ignored and brushed aside by the Court, especially when its authenticity and genuineness is not in dispute. The copy of the ledger book placed on the record by the respondent only reflects the debit entry pertaining to the dishonoured cheque but does not indicate credit entries of the payment received from the petitioners by way of the above said two Pay Orders. The complaint is nothing but misuse of process of law on behest of the respondent company with a view to pressurize the petitioners to make payment of amount which might be due from them to the respondent company for other business transactions. The complaint, therefore, under the circumstances, is not maintainable being without any cause of action.\\n\\n\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The case revolves around the legality of prosecuting the petitioner under both Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and Section 420/477A/120B Indian Penal Code, due to the filing of a complaint with the CBI and the alleged dishonor of a cheque issued by the petitioner. The lower court dismissed the application for recalling of the summons in the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, stating that the proceedings taken out by the respondents under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and the complaint registered by the CBI makes out two independent set of offences which are distinct.\n\nCritically analyzing the lower court's judgment, it appears that the court has correctly applied the law. The arguments and evidence presented by both parties seem to support the initial ruling. The petitioner's allegation of double jeopardy is not valid in this case as the ingredients of the two offences are distinct. The cheque in question is the foundation of both the cases emanating and originating out of series of same acts and transaction which are also subject matter of above referred CBI case and is not a case simplicitor of payment/discharge of liability of debt.\n\nHence, the appeal should be DISMISSED."

    "JudgmentDate": "26/02/2009",
    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n2. The aforementioned complaint has been filed by the Enforcement Directorate against M/s. Harshita Limited (presently Harshita Organics Limited) ['Company'] and six others including the Petitioner who is described therein as a Director of the said company. The allegation against the Company was that it had failed to realize the export proceeds equivalent to Rs.4, 947.43 lakhs during the year 1997-98 and that the Company failed to furnish any permission of the Reserve Bank of India ('RBI') for extension of the time for realization of the export proceeds. Accordingly, it was alleged in the complaint that the Company had contravened Sections 18 (2) and 18 (3) FERA. 3. As regards the Petitioner the only allegation in the complaint is contained in para 8 thereof which reads as under:\n\n\"8. That according to Section 68 (1) and (2) of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, every person/Director of the Company incharge of and was responsible to the conduct of the business of the company as well as the company deems to be guilty of the contravention of offence and is liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Therefore, Accused No. 2 to 7 being directors of accused No.1 along with accused No.1 were responsible to the conduct of business of the company accused No.1 at the relevant period by making exports to the other countries and failed to realize the said export proceeds, hence they have contravened the provision of Section 18 (2) and 18 (3) of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, therefore, are liable to be punished under Section 56 of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 read with Section 49 (3) and (4) of Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.\"\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n4. Learned counsel for the Petitioner relies upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Ram Kishan Rohtagi (1983) 1 SCC 1 and submits that the above averment does not satisfy the minimum requirement of the law and therefore, not even a prima facie case is made out against the Petitioner for the offence under Sections 18 (2) and 18 (3) FERA. Additionally it is submitted that the Petitioner resigned as a Director of the Company on 28th August 1997 whereas the alleged failure by the company to realize the export proceeds was relatable to a later part of the accounting year 1997-98. Therefore factually also the Petitioner cannot be made liable for the offence committed by the company in terms of Section 18(2) and (3) read with Section 68 FERA.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n5. Learned counsel for the Respondent on the other hand submits that the fact that the Petitioner was a Director of the Company till 28th August 1997 is not in dispute. Since the failure to realize the export proceeds is relatable to the year 1997-98, a prima facie case is made out against the Petitioner. He further submits that the question whether the Petitioner was in fact in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the Company can be decided only at the trial.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n1. The prayer in this petition is for discharge of the Petitioner in Complaint Case No.294/1/2002 pending in the Court of the learned Additional Chief Metropoltian Magistrate ('ACMM'), New Delhi under Section 56 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 ('FERA') read with Section 49 (3) and 49 (4) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 ('FEMA').\n",
    "Case_Result": "6. As regards the first submission made by learned counsel for the Petitioner it is seen that Section 68 FERA is a deeming provision.7. The above provision is pari materia with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('NI Act').10. Turing to the case on hand, the relevant averment as far as the Petitioner is concerned, is in para 8 of the complaint which has been extracted hereinbefore in para 3 of this judgment. Unmistakably the Petitioner is sought to be held responsible for the conduct of the business of company only on account of his \"being\" a director. 11. As regards the second submission, a reply filed by the Respondent does not dispute the fact that although the Petitioner may have been a Director at the time when the first exports were made on 31st May 1997 and 3rd June 1997, he was no longer a director on the dates when the realization of the export proceeds were done, i.e., 30th November 1997 and 3rd December 1997 respectively.

Ratan Exports & Industries & Ors pending in the court of the learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (\"ACMM\"), New Delhi insofar as it concerns the Petitioner. The complaint in question was filed by the Enforcement Directorate under Section 56 of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 (\"FERA\") read with Sections 49(3) and 49(4) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (\"Act\") against the company M/s. Ratan Exports & Industries Limited (\"REIL\") and six other persons. The Petitioner Mr. Rajan Bagaria was arrayed as accused no. 5. in the complaint. The complaint stated that by a letter dated 26th May, 1997 Reserve Bank of India (\"RBI\") had informed the Enforcement Directorate that export proceeds to the tune of Rs.22.95 crores were pending realization in the account of REIL. Earlier, for the purpose of investigation, a directive had been issued by the RBI to REIL on 19th September, 1996 under Section 33 (2) FERA calling for the details of outstanding exports. By a letter dated 23rd October, 1996 REIL informed RBI that during the period 1992-96 the Directors of the REIL were Shri Ratan Lal Bagaria, Shri Bijoy Bagaria, Shri Ajay Bagaria, Shri Mohan Churiwala, Dr. S.Rangana and Smt. Vidya Bagaria. Summons under Section 40 FERA was issued to the REIL on 17th September, 1997. Shri Palash Ganguly, Director of REIL appeared and made a statement on 17th October, 1997 before the Enforcement Directorate. Shri Palash Ganguly informed that:\\n\\n\"Shri Ratan Bagaria is controlling all the operations and the day-to-day affairs of the company, the presently S/Shri Ratan Bagaria, Managing Director and S/Shri Bijoy Bagaria, N.K. Hara, S.N. Garg and Palash Ganguly (himself) are the Directors and are working on the instructions of Shri Ratan Bagaria that Shri Ratan Bagaria is out of country to Russin since January 1997; that REIL has an office in Moscow, Russia at 19, Begovarya Street and the phone no. is 9454880; that a total amount of Rs.22,50,55,144.95 is pending realization on account of REIL, in respect of the exports made during 1992-96; that he was getting Rs.5000/- as salary; that he cannot furnish details of efforts made to realize the huge outstanding as he was made a director in 1997; that S/Shri Ratan Bagaria, Bijoy Bagaria and Ajay Bagaria were well conversant and the first two were handling the business directly.  As part of the enquiries made by the Enforcement Directorate a directive was sent on 24th October, 1997 to the United Bank of India, 16, K.G. Marg, New Delhi to furnish the details of outstanding export proceeds and the details of proprietor/partners/Directors of REIL. By their letter dated 12th April 2001 United Bank of India wrote to the Enforcement Directorate informing inter alia that \"Directors/Guarantors\" of the company were the following:\\n\\n1. Shri Rattan Bagaria\\n\\n2. Shri Bijoy Bagaria\\n\\n3. Smt. Vidya Bagaria\\n\\n4. Shri Ajay Bagaria\\n\\n5. Shri Rajan Bagaria\\n\\n6. Shri Mohan Lal Churiwala.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: On 30th May 2002 the following order was passed by the learned ACMM:\\n\\n\"30.5.2002\\n\\nPresent: SPP along with complainant.\\n\\nNew complaint presented. It be checked and registered. Photocopy of documents have also been filed along with complaint. Ahlmad is directed to check the documents as per index attached with these documents.\\n\\nAn application for exemption of personal attendance of complainant and for dispensing of recording of preliminary evidence has also been moved along with this complaint.\\n\\nAs this complaint has been filed by a public servant in discharge of his public duties hence recording of preliminary evidence dispensed with. Personal attendance of complainant has also been dispensed with. Complainant has been allowed to be represented through SPP.\\n\\nComplaint and documents perused. Heard.\\n\\nAfter going through the complaint and document and arguments raised before me by learned SPP I am of the opinion that at this stage there are sufficient grounds to proceed against accused under Section 56 of FERA 1973. I take cognizance of offence under Section 56 FERA 1973. Issue summons to accused for 3.9.2002.\\n\\nSd/- ACMM\"\n**Argument by Petitioner**: On 23rd May 2002 the Petitioner through his lawyer sent a reply to the said opportunity notice inter alia stating:\\n\\n\"My client is very much surprised to receive your notice under reference and also to note the contents thereof. My client states that on 26th day of August 1990 my client resigned as the Director from M/s. Ratan Exports & Industries Ltd and after August 1990 my client is in no way connected or related with the said company, in any manner whatsoever. My client is not concerned with any alleged transaction allegedly held after 26th August, 1990 and more particularly during the year 1992 to 1996 as alleged in your notice nor is aware of the same. A copy of the Form No. 32 duly filed with the Registrar of Companies, Kolkata shall also be forwarded to you for your perusal and information in due course.\\n\\nMy client shall have to apply the same with Registrar of Companies, Delhi and to obtain the same.\" The contention of Mr. C. Mukund, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner here is that the Petitioner is ceased to be a Director of REIL on 22nd August, 1990. Reference is made to a photocopy of the annual return along with the particulars of the Directors filed with the Registrar of Companies (ROC). It is submitted that since the period during which the contravention is alleged to have been taken place is 1992-96, the petitioner cannot be held liable for the offences if any committed by the company.  In terms of Section 68 (1) FERA the Petitioner was not a person in charge of the affairs of the company and responsible to it for the conduct of the business at the time the offence was committed.  It is submitted that it is not sufficient for the Enforcement Directorate to merely state in the complaint that the Petitioner was a Director/ Guarantor, and was in charge of the affairs company. In fact the Petitioner was not a Director/Guarantor at the time when the offence was committed.\n**Argument by Respondent**: On the other hand it is submitted by Mr. P.P. Malhotra, learned ASG appearing for the Respondent that the Enforcement Directorate proceeded inter alia on the basis of the letter issued by the United Bank of India on 12th April 2001. That letter shows that even as on 12th April 2001 the Petitioner here was a \"Director/Guarantor.\" If it was the Petitioner\"s case that he was not either a Director or a Guarantor then it was for him to show by producing evidence before the learned trial court to that effect. It is further submitted that the documents like the annual return cannot be examined in these proceedings and also have to be proved only at the trial. It is submitted that scope of interference by this Court under Section 482 CrPC is extremely limited and has to be sparingly used.\n**Citation Context**: \n**Analysis**: An opportunity notice was issued by the Respondent to each of the accused including the Petitioner here on 11th May 2002 setting out inter alia the averments referred to hereinabove. A show cause notice was nevertheless issued on 9th May, 2002 issued by the Enforcement Directorate against the company and its Directors/Guarantors including the Petitioner here for contravention of Section 18 (2) FERA. Simultaneously on 30th May 2002 a complaint was filed under Section 56 FERA against the company and its Directors/Guarantors including the Petitioner here.  On 9th February 2002 the present petition was filed and on 11th December, 2002 an interim order was passed permitting the Petitioner to appear before the learned ACMM through counsel. That interim order has continued till date. . The above section is more or less similar to the wording of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (\"NI Act\").  The law as has been explained in the said judgments is that the complaint must contain averments to the effect that the individual directors which have been arrayed as co-accused are \"persons in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the company or responsible to it for the conduct of its business.\" According to the judgment in N. Rangachari no further averments concerning the role of each directors is required for the criminal proceedings to continue. The question that arises in the present matter is whether in fact the Enforcement Directorate had material before it even at the time of filing a complaint, to reasonably conclude whether the Petitioner here was a person who was in charge of the affairs of the company and responsible to it for the conduct of its business. The records of the case reveal that the respondent\"s information about the Petitioner here being the Director/Guarantor of the company was a letter dated 12th April 2001 written by the United Bank of India. That letter does not specifically show which of the named persons are directors and which are guarantors at that time for the purpose of Section 68 FERA, the person in charge of the affairs of the company. Section 68 (2) FERA also seeks to rope any employees of the company if it is shown that the offence took place in connivance with the director, manager, secretary and any other officer. There is no other category of persons like for e.g., the guarantors, who can be made liable for the offences committed by a company under Section 138 NI Act. Likewise under Section 68 FERA, there is no question of a guarantor for being made liable the offences committed by a company. The Petitioner has forcefully refuted the allegation that he was a Director of the company at the time of commission of offence. He has throughout maintained that he has resigned on 22nd August 1990 whereas the period for which the company has been charged for the offences is between 1992 and 1996. The Respondent has not been able to show that the Petitioner was in fact either charge of the company or responsible to it for the conduct of its business at the time when the offence was committed. It is one thing to say that the complainant is not expected to know initially the working of the company for the purpose of filing the complaint. It would be another thing when the complainant itself has taken certain steps for ascertaining who is in charge of the affairs of the company and also received replies which contradict such submission.  In other words after receiving the reply of the Petitioner to the opportunity notice, the Enforcement Directorate simply ignored the explanation and proceeded to file a complaint on the basis that the Petitioner was a guarantor of the company. The Enforcement Directorate was put on a notice whether the Petitioner has sent a reply to the opportunity notice denying the liability. By ignoring the reply filed by the Petitioner here to the opportunity notice issued by it, the Enforcement Directorate erred in making a standard averment that each of the accused including the Petitioner here were the directors of the company.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The appeal should be **ALLOWED**. The lower court erred in its interpretation of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. The facts presented do not establish a prima facie case against the petitioner for contravention of Sections 18(2) and 18(3) FERA. The failure to realize the export proceeds was relatable to a later part of the accounting year 1997-98, and the petitioner resigned as a director of the company on August 28, 1997. Therefore, the petitioner cannot be made liable for the offence committed by the company under Section 68 FERA."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n2. The aforementioned complaint was filed against M/s Earthtech Enterprises Ltd., and six others, including the petitioner herein, in respect of the dishonor of cheque No.220512 dated 31st May 2006 for the sum of Rs. 5, 00, 00, 000/- (Rs. Five Crore only).\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n It is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner on the strength of the judgments in S.M.S Pharmaceuticals v. Neeta Bhalla (I) (2005) 8 SCC 89 and N.K. Wahi v. Shekhar Singh (2007) 9 SCC 481 that the complaint lacks the basic minimum averments to summon the petitioner Shri O.P. Aggarwal for the offence under Section 138 NI Act. 3. Para 3 of the complaint, which is relevant, reads:\"the accused No. 2 to 7 are the Directors, Authorised Signatory and responsible for day to day affairs of the accused No.1\".It is stated that barring this one averment, there is no other averment which satisfies the requirement of having to proceed against the person concerned who is in charge of the affairs of the company and responsible to it for the conduct of its business \"at the time of the commission of the offence\". It is stated that the cheque in question was issued on 31st May 2006. Shri O.P. Aggarwal ceased to be a Director of the Company as on 20th August 1997. A certified copy of the Form 32 is also placed on record. It is submitted that inasmuch as on the date of the commission of the offence, Mr. O.P. Aggarwal was no longer the Director of the Company, no liability could be attached to him in terms of Section 138 read with 141 NI Act. 11. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that very little progress has been made in the complaint case and that more than 11 years have passed. It is added that the petitioner himself is a senior citizen and the pendency of the criminal complaint for a long number of years constitutes a harassment.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n4. Appearing for the Respondent No.2, NAFED, Mr. T.K. Ganju, the learned Senior Counsel submits that there is an averment in the complaint that Shri O.P. Aggarwal is in fact the person who was in control of the affairs of the company and that the said averment is in consonance with the requirement of Section 141 NI Act. He further submits that once the co-accused Shri Inder Verma has written a letter dated 3rd August 2006 to the bank in question, pointing out that Shri O.P. Aggarwal was in fact the functional head of the Earthtech Enterprises Ltd., and that he issued the cheque in question under the instructions and orders of Shri O.P. Aggarwal. It is submitted that there is a reference to this letter in the complaint itself. Therefore, there was sufficient material before the learned MM to summon the petitioner for the offence under Section 138 NI Act.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n1. This petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) seeks the quashing of Complaint Case No. 299/01/2007 titled \"National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India LTd. (NAFED) v. M/s Earthtech Enterprises Ltd. & Others\" pending in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate (MM), New Delhi under Section 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (NI Act).\n",
    "Case_Result": "5. Having considered the rival submissions, this Court is of the view that the petitioner has not been able to make out a case for interference.While it is true that in para 3 of the complaint the averment is that the petitioner was a Director/Authorised Signatory and responsible for day to day affairs of the company, since the petitioner resigned as Director on 20th August 1997, that by itself may not help the petitioner escaping liability6. It is plain from a reading of the above provision thatit is not necessary for a person to be only a Director in order to answer the description of a person who is in charge of the affairs of the company and responsible to it for the conduct of its business. It could be any working person of the company7. Para 9 of the complaint which is relevant for the present purpose reads as under:\n\n\"That the legal notice dated 23.12.2006 sent to the accused persons were duly served upon them vides AD cards copies of which are enclosed as ANNEXURE-J-1 to 8. The said notice was replied by accused No. 2 & 7 creating false and fabricated defense which is contradictory to the records itself. It is pertinent to mention here that the accused No. 7 has stated in his reply that he signed the letters etc. on the orders and instruction of the accused no. 2 who was the owner/functional head of accused no. 1. The copies of the said replies are enclosed herewith as ANNEXURE-K (colly).\"8. It is clear that as far as the petitioner is concerned there was a specific averment that accused No. 7 had stated in his reply that \"he signed the letters, etc. on the orders and instructions of the accused No.2 who was the owner/functional head of accused No.1\". It is plain that this cheque in question was in fact signed by accused No. 7. The letter which has been referred to in the above paragraph is a letter dated 3rd August 2006 written by Inder Verma accused No.1 to the Union Bank of India. The relevant portion of the said letter reads as under:-\n\n\"This is also not out of place to bring in writing here that even though I acted just as an Authorised Signatory with your bank/branch (duly authorized by the Owner and Board of Directors of Earthtech Enterprises Ltd., through a clear-cut and specified Resolution and other related documents), still, I am duty bound to inform to your kindself that all the documents related to the Merchanting Trade L.C. Business and other banking business documents, if any, from time to time, especially the Exporting Documents, under a tie-up arrangement with National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED), Head Office, New Delhi were signed exclusively on the clear instructions, orders and contents of Shri O.P. Aggarwal only (the Owner and the Functional Head of Earthtech Enterprises Ltd.). Please make an important note of this fact in your bank's future records please.\"9. Although it is too premature for this Court to form any opinion on either the authenticity of the above letter which has to be proved by its author or its contents contained therein, the reference to this letter and it being produced as a document along with the complaint would constitute sufficient material for the learned MM to form a prima facie opinion that the petitioner should be summoned for the offence under Section 138 NI Act.The question here of the petitioner either being a Director or not being a Director on the date of commission of the offence and whether in fact he was a person in control of the affairs of the company will only be proved after the case goes to trial. It is not possible on a reading of the complaint as a whole along with other materials enclosed with it that not even a prima facie case is made out for the petitioner being proceeded against under Section 138 NI Act.s Petition dismissed",

It is a matter of record that no reply was filed by the petitioners to the notice issued on behalf of the complainant about the dishonor of the cheque within the stipulated time. Accordingly, the respondent/ complainant filed the present complaint in which the petitioners have been summoned by the learned Magistrate on the basis of an affidavit filed by the complainant as evidence.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 1. This petition has been filed by the petitioner aggrieved from the summoning order and the complaint filed by the respondents against them on account of dishonor of a cheque dated 07.10.2003 for a sum of Rs.24, 30, 350/- which was given by the petitioners to M/s KMF Builders and Developers Limited (hereinafter referred to as KMF) on account of having entered into an agreement for the purchase of certain shares in property comprising in the Old Survey No.105/1(part), New Survey No. 34(1) situated at village Gauipada, Taluk Kalyan, Distt.

According to the petitioners the filing of the complaint on behalf the respondent is a misuse of process of Court. It is submitted by them that on 12.07.2004 itself a collobaration agreement was entered into between the respondent No.2 and M/s Advik Finance & Properties (P) Ltd. which was a development agreement and one of the conditions of the said agreement was that:\n\n4. (a)the share of the First Party in Commercial (Lotus) is 693 sq. ft. (35% of total saleable area of 1980 sq. ft. in shops), the cost of which has been agreed at Rs. 1, 100/- per wq. Ft., which comes to Rs. 7, 62, 300/-. The Second Party has paid a sum of Rs. 6, 20, 750/- earlier as per agreement dated 10th February, 2003 and is now paying the balance amount of Rs. 1, 41, 550/-to the Second vide cheque No. 754652 dated 30.09.2003 drawn on Bank of Baroda, Banglore and as such the first Party has now left no right in respect of its share of 693 sq. ft. in the shops being constructed by the Second Party subject to clause 4(c) herein.\n\n(b) The Second Party also, with a view to discharge its liability towards First Party in respect of its share of 3739 sq. ft. (35% of total saleable area of 41891 sq. ft. in Merrigold), which would be available to the First Party on development of Plot No. 9 (Merrigold), has given a cheque No. 754653 dated 12.07.2004 for Rs. 24, 30, 350/- drawn on Bank of Baroda, Bangalore to the First Party, the cost of which has been agreed at Rs. 650/- per sq. ft.\n\n(c ) It is agreed by and between the parties hereto that if the Second Party exercise its right to sell the area of the plot No. 9 (Merrigold), the amount payable by the Second Party to the First Party as per Clause 4(b) above will become payable forthwith and the Second Party will be entitled to the discount at the rate of 15% per annum for the pre-poned period.

This condition applies only for 4(b) above.\n\n5. It is also submitted that a letter was received by the petitioners from KMF informing them that the complainant has not honored their commitment in having paid exactly the same amount to M/s Advik Finance & Properties (P) Ltd, i.e., a sum of Rs.24, 30, 350 for which a cheque was issued by them to M/s Advik vide notice dated 11.12.2003. Some of the clauses of that notice are reproduced hereunder:\n\n1. That we have recently learnt from reliable source of your having entered into an agreement with M/s KMF Builders & Developers Ltd, 18/2, Kodhihally, HAL, III Stage, Bangalore, in respect of area plot No.9(Merrigold) consisting of 3739 sq. ft. (being 35% of total saleable area of 41819 sq. ft.) in respect of land comprising under Old Survey No. 105/1(Part) and New Survey No.34/1 (Part) situated at Gauripada, Taluka Kalyan, Distt., Thane, the land belonging to us. It has also been learnt that M/s KMF Builders & Developers Ltd., have sold the development rights in respect of the said area to your goodself and that you and M/s. KMF Builders & Developers Ltd., have entered ito and executed an agreement also in respect thereof and which has since been registered in the office of Sub-Regsitrar, Kalyan on 07.10.2003 vide No.5615 of 2003.\n\n2. That it is to bring to your kind notice that the said entire land belongs to us and initially it was M/s. KMF Builders & Developers Ltd. who had entered into an Collaboration Agreement with us (supplemented by various supplementary agreement) as regards the development project and by virtue of supplementary agreement dated 22.11.1999 and by virtue of supplementary agreement dated 07.07.1995 and further supplementary agreement dated 22.11.1999 and 10.02.2003, copies of all of which are duly enclosed herewith for our kind perusal. M/s. KMF Builders & Developers Ltd. was to pay us a sum of Rs.24, 30, 350/- in respect of the share of 3739 sq. ft., as aforementioned, and which has since been purchased by you for development and in respect of which M/s. KMF Builders & Developers Ltd. even issued us a post-dated cheque also dated 12.07.2004, M/s. KMF Builders & Developers Ltd. has subsequently agreed and promised by KMF that in case it sells its right in respect of area of plot No.9, Merrigold, it will inform us immediately and that it would further become liable to pay the above amount of Rs.24, 30, 350/- forthwith subject, however, to the discount 0.15% per annum for any pre-poned period. You can very well ascertain the above from Clause 4(b) and 4(c) of two enclosed agreement dated 12.07.2003.\n\n3. That it is to bring to your kind notice that M/s. KMF Builders & Developers Ltd.had defaulted on both the above counts and besides not informing us regarding its having sold the rights to your goodself, it had not even paid us the said amount of Rs.24, 30, 350/-. We had sent a demand notice through our Advocates to M/s. KMF Builders & Developers Ltd., copy of which has also been sent to your goodself and the same is quite self-explanatory.\n\n4. That till the time M/s. KMF Builders & Developers Ltd. clears our dues of Rs.24, 30, 350/- in respect of the area of plot No.9, Merrigold which you have purchased now, it is requested that no construction/development activity be started or carried out at the said plot No.9, Merrigold so as to avoid any legal hassle or ambiguity to either of the sides.\n\n6. It has been submitted that on the insistence of M/s Advik the petitioners paid exactly the same amount to M/s Advik on behalf of M/s KMF as they are interested in the agreement entered into between the respondent/complainant for which they had issued the cheque in question. Since they made the payment on behalf of M/s Advick with the consent of respondent No.2 they were not having any liability to make the payment of the cheque to the complainant and as such they had informed the complainant in this regard. Yet the complainant took advantage of the cheque being in their possession as had filed the complaint. It is submitted that in this manner the complainant is misusing the process of Court and thus, the complaint, in these circumstances are liable to be set aside.\n**Argument by Respondent**: 12. Whereas it is the case of the respondent that:\n\ni) The petitioners paid the cheque amount to Advik, without the knowledge and consent of the respondent/complainant. The allegation that consent was obtained is false. No material in this regard has been placed on record by the petitioner. The respondent was having serious business dispute with the Advik for which OMP's were pending in Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and respondent could not have given such a consent.\n\nii) The agreements dated 12.07.2003 between the respondent and Advik and agreement dated 07.10.2003 between respondent and petitioners are independent contracts. The petitioners were not party to the earlier agreement and Advik was not a party to later agreement. However, the subject land was same. Therefore the petitioners can not seek discharge of their liability under the contract dated 07.10.2003 qua respondent on the ground that they discharged the liability of the respondent qua Advik under the agreement dated 12.07.2003. The said alleged discharge is without the knowledge and consent of the respondent.\n\niii) It is also in dispute, whether the said payment has actually been made to the Advik or not because M/s Advik had filed an OMP 205/2004 wherein he sought recovery of same amount from the respondent, under the agreement dated 12.07.2004 and a different cheque issued by the respondent under the said agreement. This OMP was disposed off vide and a order dated 27.04.2005 whereby Advik kept its right reserve to recover that amount from the respondent. Though the petitioner claim that the amount was paid to Advik on 20.07.2004 but Advik did not inform this fact to the Hon'ble court and kept its aforesaid right reserve. (Para 8, 9, and 10 of the petition on pages 12-13). The petitioner has not make Advik a party to the present petition.\n\niv) The petitioners alleged that the amount was paid to the Advik vide DD's dated 19.07.2004 against a receipt/declaration dated 20.07.2004 (available on pages 131-134). However the cheque issued by the petitioners had bounced prior to that, on 16.07.2004, (para 4 of 138 complaint at page 139B) meaning thereby the stop payment instructions were issued by the petitioner much prior to the alleged payment to Advik and hence no relation between the two.\n\nv) Though it is correct that respondent/complainant was to make payment of Rs. 24, 30, 350/- to Advik on 12.07.2004 under the agreement dated 12.07.2003 for which a post dated cheque was also issued by the respondent. Since the respondent was having all intentions to make the said payment, it had secured a cheque of same amount(cheque in question) dated 30.06.2004 under the agreement with the petitioner. However, in February, 2004 dispute arose between the respondent and said Advik and the Resondent had to file OMP No. 62/2004 against M/s Advik, in Ferbruary, 2004. M/s Advik also filed an OMP 205/2004 against the Respondent in May, 2004. Owing to the said disputes the respondent issued stopped the payment of the aforesaid cheque issued in favour of Advik. ( Para 2, 3 and 4 of the petition on pages 9-10)\n\nvi) The petitioners were aware of the said pending disputes between the respondent and Advik but despite that payment was allegedly made to Advik without the knowledge and consent of the respondent.\n\nvii) The petitioner can not be allowed to argue that 138 is not maintainable because the cheque was bounced due to \"Stop Payment\" and not because of insufficiency ;of funds as the same has not even been mentioned as one of the \"grounds\" of challenge. The complainant proceedings have been challenged solely on the ground of alleged payment to Advik. Even otherwise the said fact is matter of trial.\n**Citation Context**: \n**Analysis**: 7. In nutshell it is the case of the petitioner that the cheque dated 30.06.2004, issued by petitioners to KMF/respondent was admittedly a post dated one. It was signed on 07.10.2003, i.e., the date when Deed of Development was executed between petitioners and KMF/Respondent. The cheque was presented sometimes in July, 2004, however, in the meanwhile petitioners had already made the payment of Rs.24, 30, 350/- to the owner/Advik Finance. Intimation about the payment was sent to KMF/respondent vide letter dated 22.07.2004. KMF/respondent was, therefore, aware thereof. Despite having the knowledge, the complaint was filed on 18.09.2004. It is crystal clear that KMF/Respondnet has taken undue advantage of the post dated cheque given by the petitioners and has filed the complaint with dishonest malafide motives by concealing the material facts relating to the case. 8. The aforesaid facts amply demonstrates that KMF had developed malafide intentions of discharging its liability towards Owner/Advik Finance by paying it Rs.24, 30, 350/- and therefore instructed its bankers to \"stop payment\" in respect of the cheque dated 12.07.2004 issued by KMF to owner/Advik finance. The conduct of the respondent/complainant speaks about volume of its malafide and dishonest intentions. 9. It is, thus, submitted that clear that there is a civil dispute between owner/Advik Finance and KMF with regard to the payment of Rs.24, 30, 350/-. Petitioners, in order to avoid further dispute, as per the advice of KMF, made the payment of Rs.24, 30, 350/- directly to owner/Advik Finance. Simply because Petitioners made the payment of Rs.24, 30, 350/- to the owner/Advik Finance, KMF, due to personal grudge and with a view of taking vengeance has filed complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. 10. It is apparent that the present complaint is nothing but a gross abuse of the process of law as it has been filed with dishonest malafide motives by concealing the material facts relating to the facts. 13. It is apparent from the facts and submissions made hereinabove that the petitioners neither in law nor on equity deserve any indulgence from this Hon'ble Court and the petition filed by them deserves to be dismissed with heavy costs, as it is a matter of record that thepetitioners have not impleaded M/s Advik Finance and Properties (P) Ltd. as a party to the present petition nor have they filed any document to show that they have paid a sum of Rs.24, 30, 350/- to M/s Advik on behalf of the complainant that also with the consent of the complainant 14. Moreover,payment of a sum of Rs.24, 30, 350/- by the petitioners to M/s Advik without the consent of the complainant would not discharge their liability in respect of the cheque which was issued to the complainant and, therefore, if the said cheque has been dishonored either on account of non-availability of the money or because of the stop payment of the cheque by the petitioners without any evidence for the time being that the petitioners had money in their account, the complaint filed by the respondents and the summoning order of the Magistrate cannot be interfered with at this stage. The issues raised by the petitioners can always be considered by the Magistrate while trying the matter, if sufficient evidence is brought on record to establish that the complaint filed by the complainant was with a malafide intention or that the petitioner on account of alleged payment of money to the M/s KMF stood discharged of his liability qua the cheque issued by them which was issued under an agreement entered into between the petitioner with the complainant and had nothing to do with the agreement which the complainant entered into with M/s Advik. 15. In these circumstances, the defence which have been put forward by the petitioners in the present petition are matters which are required to be gone into by way of evidence.\n\n16. The judgments relied upon by the petitioner are also not applicable in the facts of this case.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "1. The main issue of the case is whether the petitioner, O.P. Aggarwal, the former Director of M/s Earthtech Enterprises Ltd., can be held liable for the offence under Section 138 NI Act for dishonouring a cheque issued by the company. \n\n2. The lower court's judgment seems to be based on the arguments presented by both parties. The court has correctly referred to the applicable sections of the law, S.M.S Pharmaceuticals v. Neeta Bhalla (I) (2005) 8 SCC 89 and N.K. Wahi v. Shekhar Singh (2007) 9 SCC 481. However, the court failed to account for the crucial evidence presented by the respondent, NAFED, which includes a letter written by Inder Verma, a co-accused, to the bank, pointing out that Shri O.P. Aggarwal was in fact the functional head of the company and issued the cheque under his instructions and orders. This letter, if considered, would have provided sufficient material to summon the petitioner for the offence under Section 138 NI Act.\n\n3. The appeal should be allowed, as the lower court failed to account for the crucial evidence presented by the respondent, NAFED. The letter written by Inder Verma to the bank provides enough material to hold the petitioner liable for the offence under Section 138 NI Act.\n\nOutput: ALLOWED"

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n2. Petitioners and the complainant (respondent No. 2 herein) had business dealings with each other for sale and purchase of papers and stationery products. Respondent No.2 had maintained a running account of the petitioner in its books of accounts. Petitioners issued cheque No. 003690 dated 1.6.2005 for a sum of Rs.1, 49, 474/- drawn on Lord Krishna Bank against bill No. 3103 raised by the respondent. This cheque, on presentation to the Bank, was dishonoured with the remarks \"insufficient funds\" vide Memo dated 5.7.2005. A legal notice dated 22.07.2005 was served upon the petitioners by the respondent. This notice was duly replied by the petitioners through their Advocate on 5.8.2005. Since petitioners failed to make payment of the dishonoured cheque despite serving the aforesaid notice, a complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\") was filed by the respondent. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\n3. Petitioners have challenged the maintainability of the complaint as well as the order of the trial court dated 31.08.2005 and the notice dated 10.04.2007 on the grounds that petitioners had already made payment of the impugned cheque even before the receipt of legal demand notice and no cause of action survived in favour of the respondent for filing the complaint under Section 138 of the Act. 4. It is argued by Mr. Pankaj Seth, learned counsel for the petitioners that two cheques for Rs. 2, 98, 948/- and Rs. 1, 49, 474/- being cheque Nos. 003686 and 003690 respectively were issued in favour of respondent No.2 by the petitioners against the dishonoured cheque No. 003690 for payment of bill No. 3103 and the respondents had already received the payment of the said cheques even before the notice dated 22.07.2005 was served upon the petitioners by the respondents through their Advocate. Since payment had already been received by the respondent against the impugned dishonoured cheque; the respondents, suppressing this vital fact, filed the complaint with a view to harass the petitioners and to pressurize them to extort some undue money from the petitioners. 6. In their reply dated 5.8.2005, the petitioners have specifically stated that the impugned cheque was a post dated cheque issued in favour of the respondent on an assurance that the said cheque would be presented after intimation and sufficient notice to the petitioners. It is also specifically stated in the reply that the amount of the impugned cheque was paid by way of two pay orders for a total sum of Rs. 4, 48, 422/- which included payment of Bill No. 3103. Relevant paras of the reply read as follows:\\n\\n\"3-5. With reference to the contents of para 3 to 5 of your legal notice, we have been instructed to inform you that our clients were willing to make immediate payment and it was only at the request of your clients post dated cheques were issued by our clients in favor of your clients. The same were given upon assurance of your clients that the same will be presented after intimation and sufficient notice to our clients. In fact we on behalf of our clients wish to inform you that two cheques of Rs.2, 98, 948/- and Rs. 149, 474/- being cheque No. \"003686\" and \"003690\" respectively were issued to your clients by our clients at their request. The aforesaid cheque no. \"003690\" was issued against Bill No. 3103.\\n\\n7. Our clients upon intimation of dishonor of cheques from its bank immediately instructed its bankers to issue 2 pay orders in favor of your clients. The same being Pay Order No. \"195429\" drawn on Corporation Bank amounting to Rs.2, 60, 000/- and Pay Order No. \"1515\" drawn on Lord Krishna Bank amounting to Rs.1, 88, 422/- both dated 22.06.05 have been since handed over to your clients who have duly acknowledged its receipt and appropriated the said amounts without any protest.\"\nArgument by the Respondent:\n5. Mr. M.K. Shah, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has submitted that a running account was maintained by the respondent regarding the business transactions with the petitioners and in the ledger account, the payments, when received from the petitioners, were duly credited in their account; since a running account was maintained, the payment received from the petitioners by way of pay order No. 195429 drawn on Corporation Bank amounting to Rs. 2, 60, 000/- and pay order No. 1515 drawn on Lord Krishna Bank for Rs. 1, 88, 422/- both dated 22.06.2005 were credited in the account of the petitioners and duly accounted for. These payments in no manner could be treated to have been made against the dishonoured cheque; the respondent was within its rights to file the complaint on the basis of the dishonoured cheque which was for due consideration.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n1. Impugning the order of the trial court dated 31.08.2005 and consequent notice under Section 251 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 'Cr.P.C'.) dated 10.04.2007, present petition has been filed by the petitioners seeking quashing of Criminal Complaint; case No. 1327/1 of 2005 filed by respondent No. 2 against the petitioners. On the basis of pre-summoning evidence, trial court took cognizance of the offence and summoned the petitioners vide his order dated 30.08.2005. On appearance of the petitioners in the Court, the Court served notice under Section 251 Cr.P.C. upon the petitioner on 10.04.2007.\n",
    "Case_Result": "7. The petitioners, therefore, denied any liability to pay a sum of Rs.1, 49, 474/- being the amount of the dishonoured cheque No. 003690. Petitioners had raised this defence before the trial court and they produced the receipt of the above said pay orders before the court with a copy to the counsel for respondent No. 2. Counsel for respondent No. 2 took adjournments for verification and thereafter for filing some documents show that receipt of the payment made by petitioner No. 2 was inadvertently issued by the concerned record clerk of the respondent. Despite having taken adjournments, respondent No. 2 failed to submit in the court any verification report of the receipt and also failed to file the documents indicating the circumstances in which the said receipt was issued. Under these circumstances, the receipt dated 22.06.2005 becomes relevant and crucial document for the court to consider if, the payment of the impugned cheque was duly made by the petitioners by way of two pay orders.8. Execution of this receipt by Amit Bansal, an employee of the respondent is not in dispute. This receipt is addressed to the petitioners duly signed by Amit Bansal for respondent No. 2. The contents of the receipt are reproduced as below:\n\n\"........Thanks to received 2 pay orders for the amount Rs. 2, 60, 000/- No. 195429, Drawn on Corpn. Bank, G.K.II & Rs. 1, 88, 422/- No. 1515 drawn on Lord Krishna Bank, Kalkaji, Total Rs.448422/- against ch.nos. 003686 & another Ch.No.-003690 for Rs. 1, 49, 474 in favour of M/s. KCT & Bros (c.s.) Ltd. Total amount Rs. 448422/-..........\"9. Bare reading of this receipt makes it clear that two pay orders being pay order No. 195429 for Rs. 2, 60, 000/- drawn on Corporation Bank, G.K.II and another pay order No. 1515 drawn on Lord Krishna Bank, Kalkaji for Rs. 1, 88, 422/- were admittedly received by the respondent as payment against cheque Nos. 003686 for Rs. 2, 98, 948/- and cheque No. 003690 for Rs. 1, 49, 474/-, the total amount being Rs. 4, 48.422/-. Both these pay orders have been got encashed by the respondents. The impugned cheque was issued against Bill No. 3103. As per this receipt, the payment of the impugned cheque was immediately made to the respondent when petitioners came to know that the said cheque on presentation was dishonoured.10. The acknowledgement receipt bonafidely issued by a responsible officer of the respondent company on the letter head of the company cannot be ignored and brushed aside by the Court, especially when its authenticity and genuineness is not in dispute. The copy of the ledger book placed on the record by the respondent only reflects the debit entry pertaining to the dishonoured cheque but does not indicate credit entries of the payment received from the petitioners by way of the above said two Pay Orders.The complaint is nothing but misuse of process of law on behest of the respondent company with a view to pressurize the petitioners to make payment of amount which might be due from them to the respondent company for other business transactions. The complaint, therefore, under the circumstances, is not maintainable being without any cause of action. Petition dismissed",

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe case revolves around the interpretation of Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, specifically whether the respondent had a valid cause of action to file a complaint against the petitioner for dishonoring a cheque. The lower court ruled that the petitioner's payment was made after the legal demand notice and, thus, the complainant had no valid cause of action.\n\nIn analyzing the case, it is essential to consider the arguments and evidence presented by both parties. The petitioner argued that the cheque was issued post-dated and payment was made before the legal demand notice. The respondent argued that the payment was credited in the account and was not made against the dishonored cheque.\n\nUpon examination, the petitioner's argument appears to be more convincing. The petitioner provided evidence that the cheque was issued post-dated and payment was made before the legal demand notice. This suggests that the cheque was issued on an assurance that it would be presented after intimation and sufficient notice to the petitioner.\n\nThe respondent's argument, however, seems to overlook the fact that the petitioner provided evidence of payment before the legal demand notice. The respondent's position that the payment was credited in the account and was not made against the dishonored cheque is not supported by the evidence provided.\n\nGiven the evidence and arguments presented, the lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint appears to be correct. The respondent failed to establish a valid cause of action for filing a complaint under Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. Therefore, the appeal should be allowed, and the complaint dismissed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n2. Complainant (respondent No.2 herein) is a Private Limited Company and is engaged inter alia in the business of travel, tourism and ticketing. On 7th November, 2006 complainant M/s. TSI-Travel Services International Pvt. Ltd. entered into an agreement with accused No.1 company 'Arunodaya Travels' through accused No.4 Mrs. Rashima. Accused Nos.2 to 4 were the Directors of accused No.1 company. Thereafter complainant had been providing tickets to accused No.1 company during the course of business dealings. Complainant/respondent No.2 company had been maintaining a running account of the accused in its books of account. During the course of business dealings a sum of Rs.3, 33, 861/- had become due and payable by the accused company and in discharge of its liability, accused company issued two cheques (i) Cheque No.166009, dated 22.03.2007 drawn on Citibank for a sum of Rs.2, 00, 565/- & (ii) Cheque No.166008, dated 13.4.2007, drawn on Citibank for a sum of Rs.1, 33, 296/-.\n\n3. These cheques on presentation were dishonoured with the remark \"Insufficient Funds\" and on subsequent presentation with the remarks \"Payment stopped by drawer\". Resultantly, respondent No.2 issued a legal notice dated 15th May, 2007, posted on 17-18th May, 2007 to the accused persons, calling upon them to pay the cheques amount within the stipulated period of 15 days on receipt of the notice. The legal notice sent to accused No.1 company was returned with the remarks \"Always locked\". Petitioner Sameer Karnani (accused No.2, in the complaint) did not send any reply to the legal notice. This notice was duly replied by accused Nos. 3 and 4 separately. Since the accused persons failed to make the payment of the impugned cheques, complainant filed a complaint under Section 138 of the N.I.Act which is under challenge in this petition.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Mr. Jaswinder Singh, learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that petitioner had no knowledge of the issuance of the impugned cheques nor he had discharged any responsibility of the company towards business dealings between the complainant and the accused No.1 company; the complaint does not disclose commission of any offence by the petitioner as no specific averments have been made in the complaint to disclose commission of any offence by the petitioner to rope him for vicariously liability for the act of accused No.1 company. He has further submitted that petitioner is not a signatory of the cheques nor he handed over the cheques to the complainant towards discharge of liability of the company as a Director as he never participated in the dealings of the company with the complainant. 5. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that ingredients and requirement of Section 141 of the N.I. Act are not made out from the averments in the complaint. The learned M.M. erroneously summoned the petitioner as an accused without application of mind and, therefore, the order of the trial court being illegal deserves to be quashed.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n7. Mr. M.P.Singh, learned counsel for the respondent/State while refuting the submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner has urged that it is specifically averred in para 5 of the complaint that petitioner was a Director of the accused No.1 company and was responsible for its day to day business and, therefore, was liable for the acts committed for and on behalf of accused No.1 company and in view of Section 141 of the N.I.Act, has committed an offence within the meaning of Section 138 of the N.I.Act and therefore has been rightly summoned by the trial court.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nPetitioner Sameer Karnani has filed this petition invoking the jurisdiction of this court under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 'Cr.P.C.'), assailing the order of the trial court dated 4th July, 2007 passed in Complaint Case No.1667/01 of 2007 under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, (hereinafter referred to as 'N.I.Act') whereby the trial court was pleased to summon the petitioner along with other accused persons for an offence punishable under Section 138 N.I.Act.\n",
    "Case_Result": "8. It is a common case of the parties that petitioner is one of the Directors of accused No.1 company. As per the averments in the complaint, the agreement was executed between the complainant and accused No.1 company on 7.11.2006 through Mrs. Rashima, who is Director and accused No.4 in the instant complaint. From the complaint, it is not known as to which of the Directors had issued impugned cheques in favour of the complainant/respondent No.2. The fact remains,petitioner is not the signatory of the impugned cheques. To fasten the liability on the petitioner for offence under Section 138 of the N.I.Act, it is necessary for this court of see the averments contained in the complaint qua the petitioner. The only relevant paragraph wherein the petitioner features is para 5 of the complaint which reads as follows:-\n\n\"That in the regular course of business, the complainant was providing tickets to the accused No.1, i.e. Arunodaya Travels (Division of Bradbury SPG and WVG Mills Limited), C-3, LSC-1, Paschimi Marg, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi-110 057. That the accused No.2 to 4 are the directors of the accused No.1 company engaged in to day to day affairs and management of the accused company, and are jointly and severally liable for the offence complained of. Mrs. Rashima, the accused No.4 had entered in to the agreement with the complainant on 7-11-2006.\"9. Thus, it is clear that allegations against the petitioner and other accused persons being Directors of accused No.1 company are that they are engaged in the day to day affairs and management of the accused company and are jointly and severally liable for the offence complained of. It is only accused No.4 Mrs. Rashima, who has been specifically named in this paragraph having entered into agreement with the complainant on 7.11.2006.10. From perusal of the entire complaint it is obvious that nowhere the complainant has specifically assigned any role to the petitioner to indicate that petitioner was engaged in the day to day affairs and management of the company and therefore was jointly and severally liable for the offence under Section 138 of the N.I.Act. Prima facie there is nothing on record to suggest that petitioner was actively involved in execution of the agreement dated 7.11.2006 or otherwise was actively involved in the company in company's day to day business.11. For purposes of Section 141 of the N.I.Act, it was necessary for the complainant to have specifically averred in the complaint that at the time when offence was committed, the person/accused was incharge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. Without this averment being made in the complaint, the requirement of Section 141 of the N.I.Act cannot be said to be satisfied.12. True that a Managing Director or a Joint Managing Director are incharge of the company and, therefore, are responsible to the company in the conduct of its day to day business. A person holding such position in a company becomes liable under Section 141 of the N.I.Act. Similarly, a signatory of a dishonoured cheuqe, may be a Director or a responsible officer of the company is responsible for the incriminating act within the meaning of Section 141 sub-Section 2 of the N.I. Act. Petition allowed",

The petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court under Section 227 of the Constitution of India read with Section 482 of Cr.P.C., 1973 in the matter of the order dated 14.10.2019 passed by the Court of the third Addl. Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Margao.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n2. Heard Shri S.S. Kakodkar learned Advocate for the petitioner who contended that the complaint was lodged by him against the respondent for dishonour of the cheque in an amount of Rs. 9,00,000/- under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (Act for short hereinafter) A total number of five cheques were issued by the respondent in discharge of his liability which were however returned dishonoured and the process was started by filing a complaint under Section 138 of the Act. Process was issued and thereupon an order was made under Section 143 A of the Act directing the respondent to deposit an amount of Rs. 1,80,000/-. Since the amount was not forthcoming, an order was passed under Section 421 Cr.P.C. for recovery which was pending since then. The petitioner as the complainant had filed his affidavit in evidence and as on 16.03.2019 part of the examination was over and part of the cross examination was conducted on 11.04.2019. The cross examination was closed on 16.08.2019 and thereafter the case was adjourned for recording the statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. An application was moved under Section 311 Cr.P.C on 29.08.2019 by the respondent/accused seeking for the recall of the complainant for cross examination and setting aside the order dated 16.08.2019 closing the cross examination of the complainant. It was also not available to invoke such a power to fill up the lacuna and moreover the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class overlooked the reasons in the order dated 16.08.2019. There were also no findings recorded by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class that the recall of the witness was necessary for a just decision of the case. The reply filed by the petitioner was also not considered by the learned Trial Court which was besides the fact that it lacked inherent jurisdiction to recall its own order. The impugned order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class was against the statute and against its jurisdiction. The roznama produced by the respondent was from 11.06.2019 and not prior thereto which would show the number of occasions where he had sought for adjournments. He placed reliance in Rajaram Prasad Yadav {(2013) 14 SCC 461} and pressed for quashing of the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nShri Ravi Gawas, learned Advocate for the respondent submitted that the respondent/accused had moved the application which he had rightly done invoking the jurisdiction of the court recalling the witness under Section 311 Cr.P.C. He submitted that the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class was well within its powers to allow the application. He placed reliance in Natasha Singh Vs. CBI (State), {2013 Cr.L.J.3346} and in State Bank of India Vs. Km. Chandra Govindji, {(2000) 7 Supreme 707} and submitted that the impugned order did not call for any interference in the exercise of the writ jurisdiction of this Court.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe learned Magistrate however, consequent to the impugned order dated 14.10.2019 allowed the application for recall under Section 311 Cr.P.C. without any basis whatsoever when no power of recall was available to the Magistrate in terms of Section 311 Cr.P.C. on the closure of the evidence.\n",
    "Case_Result": "5. i have considered the submissions of Shri S.S. Kakodkar, learned Advocate for the petitioner and Shri R. Gawas on behalf of the respondent, considered the judgments relied upon and more particularly the predicates of Section 311 Cr.P.C. to decide the petition accordingly.7. First and foremost, a bare reading of Section 311 Cr.P.C. would reveal in no uncertain terms that it was not available to the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class to recall the order of closure of evidence by invoking Section 311 Cr.P.C. when it amply demonstrates in clear terms what is the latitude and extent of the said provision. Secondly it is abundantly clear that the recourse to such an application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. is not to fill up the lanuna but to examine and or re-examine a witness which estimation of the Court is essential to the just decision of the case. Thirdly, the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class totally overlooked the reasons in its earlier order dated 16.08.2019 wherein there was a clear record that the advocate for the respondent had been seeking time on the ground of his own sickness on several occasions and that the Court did not doubt the genuineness of the ground stated in the present application. Nonetheless, the court observed that inspite of giving various opportunities no cross examination came to be conducted as well and there being no merit in the application where the complainant was a senior citizen the Court did not find any reason for granting time, rejected the application for seeking time and closed the cross examination of the complainant. These aspects were not at all looked into by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class while passing the order as it did which is assailed in the present petition. The learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class also overlooked the predicates of Section 311 Cr.P.C. which empowered the Court to summon a material witness or examine a person or recall and re-examine a person who was already examined if it appeared to be essential to the just decision of the Court. There was no finding by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class that the recall and re-examination of the complainant was necessary for the just decision of the case which is besides the fact that there was no inherent power in the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class to recall its earlier order dated 16.08.2019. Moreover, there was no power in the Court while invoking Section 311 Cr.P.C. to recall its earlier order of closure of the cross examination under the misappreciation of the law that the power to recall the witness included also the power to recall its own order. This is besides the fact that it has been otherwise shown that the respondent has been evading the process of the Court in depositing the amount as ordered by it in terms of Section 143 A of the Act and for which necessary recovery proceedings under Section 421 Cr.P.C. are pending.In Rajaram Yadav (supra) a two Judge Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court discussed the nature and the scope of the powers under Section 311 Cr.P.C. and the principles to be followed by the Court in exercise of such powers but the paramount consideration should always be for the just decision of the case. t spelt out the principles which will have to be borne in mind by the Courts while dealing with the application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. and being enumerative as below.\n\n(i) Whether the Court is right in thinking that the new evidence is needed by it? Whether the evidence sought to be led in under Section 311 is noted by the Court for a just decision of a case?\n\n(ii) The exercise of the widest discretionary power under Section 311 Cr.P.C. should ensure that the judgment should not be rendered on inchoate, inconclusive and speculative presentation of facts, as thereby the ends of justice would be defeated.(iii) If evidence of any witness appears to the Court to be essential to the just decision of the case, it is the power of the Court to summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person.\n\n(iv) The exercise of power under Section 311 Cr.P.C. should be resorted to only with the object of finding out the truth or obtaining proper proof for such facts, which will lead to a just and correct decision of the case.\n\n(v) The exercise of the said power cannot be dubbed as filling in a lacuna in a prosecution case, unless the facts and circumstances of the case make it apparent that the exercise of power by the Court would result in causing serious prejudice to the accused, resulting in miscarriage of justice.vi) The wide discretionary power should be exercised judiciously and not arbitrarily.\n\n(vii) The Court must satisfy itself that it was in every respect essential to examine such a witness or to recall him for further examination in order to arrive at a just decision of the case.\n\n(viii) The object of Section 311 Cr.P.C. simultaneously imposes a duty on the Court to determine the truth and to render a just decision.\n\n(ix) The Court arrives at the conclusion that additional evidence is necessary, not because it would be impossible to pronounce the judgment without it, but because there would be a failure of justice without such evidence being considered.(x) Exigency of the situation, fair play and good sense should be the safeguard, while exercising the discretion. The Court should bear in mind that no party in a trial can be foreclosed from correcting errors and that if proper evidence was not adduced or a relevant material was not brought on record due to any inadvertence, the Court should be magnanimous in permitting such mistakes to be rectified.\n\n(xi) The Court should be conscious of the position that after all the trial is basically for the prisoners and the Court should afford an opportunity to them in the fairest manner possible. In that parity of reasoning, it would be safe to err in favour of the accused getting an opportunity rather than protecting the prosecution against possible prejudice at the cost of the accused. The Court should bear in mind that improper or capricious exercise of such a discretionary power, may lead to undesirable results.(xii) The additional evidence must not be received as a disguise or to change the nature of the case against any of the party.\n\n(xiii) The power must be exercised keeping in mind that the evidence that is likely to be tendered, would be germane to the issue involved and also ensure that an opportunity of rebuttal is given to the other party.\n\n(xiv) The power under Section 311 Cr.P.C. must therefore, be invoked by the Court only in order to meet the ends of justice for strong and valid reasons and the same must be exercised with care, caution and circumspection. The Court should bear in mind that fair trial entails the interest of the accused, the victim and the society and, therefore, the grant of fair and proper opportunities to the persons concerned, must be ensured being a constitutional goal, as well as a human right.. In Natasha Singh, the Hon'ble Apex Court reiterated the proposition that the power under Section 311 Cr.P.C. has to be exercised to render a just decision in the case. It does not at all buttress the case of the respondent that the power to recall a witness under Section 311 Cr.P.C. also encapsules within it the power to recall its own order and in the absence of any inherent power vested in the Judicial Magistrate, First Class. The judgment in State Bank of India is also not of any significance to the case of the applicant which observed that in ascertaining whether a party had a reasonable opportunity to forward his case or not one should not ordinarily go beyond the date on which the adjournment is sought for.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9a0c\n**Facts**: Though this petition is listed for admission, with consent of both parties, the matter is taken up for final disposal. Parties are referred to as per their status before the trial Court.  This revision petition has been preferred by accused aggrieved by judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 22.2.2019, passed by I Addl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Dharwad, in C. C.No.22/2018, convicting petitioner for the offence punishable under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('the Act' for short) and sentencing him to pay a fine of Rs. 4,52,000/-, in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months. Out of the fine amount, Rs. 4,51,000/- was ordered to be paid to complainant and Rs. 1,000/- was ordered to be paid to State.  Brief facts leading to filing of this revision petition are that, it is the case of complainant that himself and accused are well known to each other and due to their acquaintance and intimacy, accused received loan of Rs. 4,50,000/- from complainant and issued a cheque for Rs. 4,50,000/- towards repayment of loan vide cheque bearing No.319509 dated 11.8.2017.  On presentation of said cheque, the same came to be dishonoured for the reason 'funds insufficient' on 1.11.2017. Thereafter complainant got issued legal notice to accused on 13.11.2017. Despite service of notice to accused, no reply was sent and the amount so demanded was not repaid. Hence complainant filed a complaint under section 200 of Cr.P. C. for the offence punishable under section 138 of the Act. 6. After filing of complaint, cognizance was taken by the trial Court and on receipt of summons, accused appeared before the Court and pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried and accordingly he was tried. Thereafter complainant's sworn statement was recorded and it was treated as his evidence and he got marked Exs.P.1 to P.5 and closed his side.  Thereafter, statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P.C. was recorded. Accused denied all incriminating evidence against him, but he did not choose to cross examine complainant neither let-in evidence on his behalf Aggrieved by the said judgment, accused challenged the same before the District and Sessions Court in Crl. A. No.25/2019. On examining the material evidence placed before the Court and after re-appreciating the evidence on record, the appellate Court came to conclusion that accused is guilty of offence punishable under section 138 of the Act. Aggrieved by the judgment of conviction by trial Court and confirmation by appellate Court, accused is before this Court challenging the legality, correctness and validity of judgments of both the Courts.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  On challenge, the said judgment of trial Court has been confirmed by the Prl. District and Sessions Court, Dharwad, by judgment dated 1.7.2020 in Crl.A. No.25/2019.  On the basis of material evidence and documents produced by complainant, the trial Court came to a conclusion that complainant has proved necessary ingredients of section 138 of the Act and convicted accused for the offence punishable under section 138 of the Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 4,52,000/-. Appellate Court held that as per law Court is empowered to impose fine of double the amount of cheque. It has confirmed the judgment of trial Court and did not interfere with the same.  Thereafter, on 22.2.2019 judgment was pronounced by trial Court convicting accused for the offence punishable under section 138 of N.I. Act. Aggrieved by this judgment accused preferred an appeal.  On considering contentions of accused and relying on the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank Association (supra), appellate Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order passed by trial Court.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: . Learned counsel for petitioner contends that order of conviction passed by trial Court and confirmation of the same by appellate Court is not in accordance with law and opposed to principles of natural justice.  The same deserves to be set aside and an opportunity has to be provided to accused to defend his case effectively. It is further contended by learned counsel for petitioner that since no opportunity was provided to accused to cross examine PW.1/complainant, he was unable to confront the witness by producing material evidence in support of his case to disprove the case of complainant. 9. It is his contention that complainant has misused the cheque to make unlawful gain and the same was not issued for realization of any legally recoverable debt. He further contends that both the Courts have gravely erred in coming to a conclusion that case of complainant is proved beyond reasonable doubt despite not providing any opportunity to accused to rebut the presumption cast against him. Learned counsel further contends that the judgment of both Courts suffers from serious infirmities and on account of non providing sufficient opportunities to accused, the same deserves to be reversed. On these aspects learned counsel seeks to allow this revision petition and set aside the orders passed by both the Courts and to acquit petitioner.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Per contra, learned counsel for respondent contends that order passed by trial Court convicting accused and confirmed by appellate Court is in accordance with law and the materials placed on record. The same does not call for any interference. He contends that complainant has followed necessary procedure for adducing evidence and sufficient time was provided to accused to cross examine PW.1, but the same has not been utilized and rightly trial Court has convicted accused for the aforesaid offence. . Learned counsel further contends that intent of legislature is to dispose of the case pertaining to Negotiable Instruments Act within a period of six months in accordance with law. Trial Court accorded sufficient opportunity to accused to examine witnesses, but despite providing sufficient opportunity, the same was not utilized and hence convicted accused for the aforesaid offence which has been confirmed by appellate Court. Learned counsel for respondent contends that there is no illegality or perversity in the orders passed by trial Court and appellate Court. The same is in accordance with law and the precedent laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court for disposal of cases punishable under section 138 of the Act.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Heard Shri T.R.Patil, learned counsel for petitioner and Shri Praveen P. Tarikar, learned counsel for respondent. .. Having heard learned counsel for petitioner and respondent, a short point that arises for consideration is whether there is any illegality or perversity committed by the Court below in passing the impugned order. . During the course of arguments before this Court, learned counsel for petitioner has produced order sheet of trial Court to show that no opportunity was provided to him. On perusal of order sheet, it is seen that on 21.1.2019 accused appeared before trial Court, filed an application for grant of bail under section 436 of Cr.P. C.  The same was allowed and on the same day plea of accused was recorded, wherein accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Trial Court relying on the judgment of Hon' ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association and others vs. Union of India and others, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 590, treated the sworn statement of complainant as evidence, closed the side of complainant and recorded statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C. and posted the matter on 24.1.2019 for evidence of accused.  On 24.1.2019, both parties tried to settle the matter but same was unsuccessful and accordingly the matter was posted for accused evidence on 8.2.2019, on which date accused remained absent. Since no evidence was adduced by accused, the same was taken as nil and thereafter matter was posted for arguments on 16.2.2019.  On 16.2.2019 accused remained absent, no representation was made, arguments of accused were taken as nil and the matter was posted for judgment on 22.2.2019.  . During the course of arguments before this Court, learned counsel for petitioner has pleaded that he has a very good case on merit and if an opportunity is provided, he will be able to establish and rebut the presumption cast on him by disproving the case of complainant. Learned counsel has restricted his argument to remit the case back to trial Court for adjudication of the matter by providing an opportunity to adduce defence evidence.  It is seen in the orders passed on 21.1.2019 that trial Court has relied on a judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association (supra) and has rightly treated the sworn statement as evidence and thereafter recorded statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C. and posted the matter for defence evidence Thereafter matter was adjourned for two dates providing opportunity to accused to adduce evidence. Since no evidence was let-in by accused, the matter was posted for judgment, pursuant to which judgment was pronounced.  Considering the intent of legislature and the judgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association (supra), wherein guidelines have been laid down with regard to disposal of matters pertaining to Negotiable Instruments Act. It is seen that there is no illegality committed, per-se, in treating sworn statement as evidence and recording statement of accused under section 313 of Cr. P.C. on the same day and posting the matter for defence evidence.  As this is a summary trial, parties can adduce evidence by way of affidavit and there is nothing wrong in treating the sworn statement as evidence and recording statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C., on the same day. In the aforesaid judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court, it is held that, Courts must ensure examination-in-chief and cross-examination and re-examination of complainant to be conducted within three months and thereafter accused must examine witnesses and be available for cross-examination as and when directed by trial Court and there is no dispute that speedy and expeditious procedure should be adopted by trial Court dealing with the matters pertaining to section 138 of the N.I.Act.  In the present case on hand, during the course of arguments learned counsel for petitioner has submitted that an opportunity may be given to him to cross examine complainant and to lead his evidence for which conditions may be imposed by this Court and he is agreeable to deposit entire cheque amount within one month from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.  It is seen from records that the trial Court has followed the ratio and the principles laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank Association stated supra. But, what is to be seen here is whether in order to provide substantial justice to parties, an opportunity could be provided to accused by imposing certain conditions which should not be detrimental to the interest of the complainant. Learned counsel for the complainant consents to the matter being remanded to trial Court with a condition that accused deposits entire cheque amount and a specific time limit is provided for adducing evidence by accused and for conclusion of the case.  In such circumstances, in the interest of principle of natural justice and with an intention to provide an opportunity for accused to put forth his case by cross examining the complainant and by adducing his own evidence where no harm or grave injustice would be caused to complainant, the matter could be remanded back to trial Court. This Court is not subscribing to the lackadaisical attitude of accused in not availing opportunity provided by trial Court. Nevertheless, in the interest of principle of natural justice and to provide substantial justice to parties and with consent of counsel for the petitioner and counsel for respondent this matter could be remanded to trial Court for recording of evidence of accused and for cross examination of PW.1 complainant.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case revolves around the interpretation and application of Section 143 A of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, in conjunction with Section 311 Cr.P.C., specifically in the context of a dishonoured cheque complaint under Section 138 of the Act. The lower court's decision to allow the application for recall under Section 311 Cr.P.C., despite no such power being available on the closure of evidence, is being challenged.\n\nUpon analysis, the lower court's judgment appears to be flawed as it overlooks the explicit limitations of Section 311 Cr.P.C. in the context of a closed evidence case. The section only allows the Magistrate to recall a witness if the evidence recorded by the Magistrate is incomplete for reasons not attributable to the complainant or the accused. In the given case, the evidence is complete, and the incompleteness is due to the respondent's actions, making Section 311 Cr.P.C inapplicable.\n\nFurthermore, the respondent's arguments, relying on Rajaram Prasad Yadav {(2013) 14 SCC 461} and Natasha Singh Vs. CBI (State), {2013 Cr.L.J.3346}, do not hold water in this case, as they pertain to situations where the evidence is incomplete due to unforeseen circumstances or natural calamities.\n\nIn conclusion, the lower court's judgment should be set aside, as it is contrary to the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act and Cr.P.C. The appeal is allowed, and the impugned order dated 14.10.2019 passed by the Court of the third Addl. Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Margao is quashed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n. Present appeal has been filed under Section 378(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the original complainant challenging the acquittal of respondent - accused by learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Court No.3, Shrirampur in Summary Criminal Case No.452 of 2013 on 17-09-2016, whereby the respondent came to be acquitted of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the 'N.I. Act'). By order dated 29-06-2017, this Court had granted leave to appeal. Heard learned Advocate Mr. G. D. Jain for appellant and learned Advocate Mr. P. S. Dighe for respondent.  It has been vehemently submitted on behalf of the appellant that the complainant had come with the case that on the request of the accused, she had extended hand loan of Rs. 80,000/- and in discharge of that legal debt or liability, the accused had issued cheque bearing No.741625 on 28-03-2013 drawn on her account maintained with Bank of Maharashtra branch at Shrirampur. It was assured that on the presentation of the said cheque, it would be honoured.  Therefore, on the same day, the said cheque was presented by the complainant with her bank, namely, Nagar Urban Co-operative Bank, Branch at Shrirampur. However, the said cheque came to be dishonoured on 30-03-2013 on the ground \"funds insufficient\". Thereafter, the complainant had issued notice on 04-04-2013 through Advocate and demanded the amount under the cheque. In spite of receipt of the said statutory notice, accused did not give the amount, but gave a false reply and, therefore, the complaint was filed before the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Shrirampur. The complainant has examined herself and produced certain documents. The accused has also examined herself as well as a witness in defence.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned Advocate for the appellant would submit that the learned Magistrate has not appreciated the evidence properly, so also has not considered the legal aspects involved in proper perspective. When the cheque was admittedly given by the accused, there was a presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. The learned Magistrate, thereafter, ought not to have gone into the aspect regarding the source of income while lending the amount. Further, when the cheque was admittedly issued by the accused, then learned Magistrate ought not to have invoked his powers under Section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act and take it upon himself to have comparison with the alleged admitted signature.  Further error has been committed that the said amount has not been shown in the income tax returns and, therefore, it has been taken as unaccounted cash. He failed to consider the legal position in Bipin Mathurdas Thakkar Vs. Samir alias Sameer Dessai and another (2015 (1) BOM. C.R. (Cri) 601), wherein the ratio in Sanjay Mishra Vs. Kanishka Kapoor, (2009 (3) Bom.C.R. (Cri) 157) was distinguished and held that it is not based on sound law. In Bipin Thakkar's case (Supra), it has been held that \"every amount which is not shown in the income tax returns or the cash that has been given as hand loan will not amount to violation of the Income Tax Act and cannot be termed as unaccounted amount.\" Learned Judicial Magistrate First Class totally erred in holding that the presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act has been rebutted by the accused. The accused had come with the case that the complainant is indulged in a business of chit fund (Bhishi) and the accused was one of the member of the same. She had issued the cheque in favour of the complainant by way of security for the repayment of amount of the said chit fund. Accused has stated that the complainant has misused the said cheque and, therefore, in order to prove her defence, she had examined AW 1 Pratibha Patil, who claimed that she is also the member of chit fund. She has tried to say that lot of times she had gone to the house of the complainant in connection with the said chit fund, however, in her cross-examination, she has clearly stated that she has no documentary evidence to prove that she was the member of the chit fund run by complainant. In her testimony, the accused has stated that she was owing Rs. 40,000/- to the complainant towards the sarees purchased by her from the complainant. It is her say that complainant had not given her amount of one Bhishi and it is her say that if any person failed to contribute to the Bhishi, then complainant used to recover it from the cheques, which she had taken as security. However, in her cross-examination, it can be seen that whatever she had stated in the examination-in-chief was never put by her in her reply to the statutory notice. That means, the stand taken by the accused was not firm and even by preponderance of probabilities, it could not have been concluded by the learned Magistrate that the accused has rebutted presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. Learned Advocate for the complainant - appellant, therefore, requested to allow the appeal and convict the accused by holding that the complainant has proved that the accused has committed offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act beyond reasonable doubt.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nPer contra, the learned Advocate for the respondent supported the reasons given by the learned Judge while acquitting the accused. He submitted that first of all the burden which was on the shoulders of the complainant to prove that she had extended the hand loan to the accused itself is false. Though it has come on record that the complainant is running a business in sarees, yet, she could not have given so much of cash in contravention of Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act. He submitted that the learned trial Judge has rightly relied on the decision of this Court in Sanjay Mishra Vs. Kanishka Kapoor @ Nikki and another (2009 (4) Mh.L.J. 155), wherein it has been held that, \"when the applicant had not disclosed that he has advanced amount to the respondent to the Income Tax Department, then that amount would be an unaccounted amount and, therefore, it cannot be stated that there is a liability to pay such amount.  The liability to pay unaccounted cash amount cannot be a legally enforceable debt within the meaning of explanation to Section 138 of the N.I. Act.\" It has been further submitted that the complainant should show or in other words should discharge the initial burden to prove that the disputed cheque has been issued towards legally enforceable debt or liability. Reliance has been placed on the decision in K Subramani Vs. K. Damodara Naidu, [(2015) 1 SCC 99), wherein it has been held that \"when legally enforceable debt is not proved by the complainant by adducing proof regarding source of income from which alleged loan was given to the accused, then it will have to be held that the presumption in favour of holder of cheque has been rebutted.\"  Further, reliance has been placed on the decision in Krishna Janardhan Bhat Vs. Dattatraya G. Hegde, (2008(4) Mh.L.J. 354), wherein it has been held that \"existence of legally recoverable debt is not a matter of presumption. It is raised in favour of a holder of the cheque that same has been issued for discharge of any debt or other liability.\"  Learned Advocate for the respondent has relied on the decision in Krishna Bhat (supra). However, we should take into consideration the legal position laid down in Rangappa vs. Sri Mohan, [2010 (4) Bom. C. R. 652 (SC): (2010) 11 SCC 441], which is three Judge Bench decision as well as M/S. Shree Daneshwari Traders (supra).\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nAfter hearing both sides, the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class has acquitted the accused.\n",
    "Case_Result": "When in this case the accused herself has entered into the witness box and had also examined witness to support her contention that the complainant was running a chit fund and she had taken certain cheques from the members of the chit fund, so also from the accused, then it was as a security and not towards the alleged legally enforceable debt or liability for extending hand loan of Rs. 80,000/-.The learned Judicial Magistrate First Class was right in making comparison of the signature on the disputed cheque with the admitted signature of the accused under Section 18 of the Indian Evidence Act. The acquittal of the respondent - accused was legal and correct, which requires no interference at the hands of this Court.At the outset, it will have to be seen as to whether the complainant has discharged the initial burden to prove that she had advanced hand loan to accused. Complainant has deposed as per her complaint. In her cross-examination taken on behalf of accused, she was firm in saying that she had advanced the said amount on the request of accused. It has come on record that complainant runs a saree shop. She has produced Shop Act licence to support her said contention. In fact, if we peruse the testimony of accused along with this evidence, then we can get that accused is not disputing that complainant runs a saree shop. That means the complainant has source of income and she was in a position to extend hand loan. Another important point is that accused is not disputing issuance of cheque Exhibit-37. If we peruse the evidence in rebuttal, adduced by accused, then it can be seen that she has put forward two fold defence. One is that the said cheque was given by her as security for chit fund transaction. She says that it was blank cheque. This defence would infer that she is admitting her signature on the cheque Exhibit-37. As regards the rest of the contents on cheque Exhibit-37 is concerned, she does not say in specific words that those contents are not in her handwriting. When she has specifically admitted her signature on the cheque Exhibit-37, then learned Magistrate went wrong in unnecessarily exercising his powers under Section 73 of Indian Evidence Act to compare the signature of the accused on Exhibit-37 with her admitted signature. No steps were taken by accused to send the disputed cheque for the opinion of handwriting expert. Learned Magistrate ought not to have shown such anxiety. Unnecessary or hyper activism on the part of learned Magistrate was uncalled for. When accused admits his/her signature on the disputed cheque, then the legal position on this point is also clear that the complainant would get an authority under Section 20 of N.I. Act to complete the incomplete cheque i.e. to write rest of the contents. Thus, when in this case, as per the first defence, accused is admitting that she had given the cheque Exhibit-37, thereby admitting her signature on the cheque, then she had impliedly given authority to the complainant to complete the cheque and present it for encashment. The second defence appears to be halfhearted. Accused says that she was the member of chit fund run by complainant and she had not given her contribution in chit fund/bhishi once and that amount was due. So also amount of Rs. 40,000/- was due from her to the complainant towards purchase of sarees. She has not given specification of the same. When she had purchased those sarees and since when the said amount on both count was due from her, accused says that the cheque has then been misused, which was given for security. Accused has examined AW 1 Pratibha, who claims that she is also member of the said chit fund and one blank cheque was given to complainant by accused on her behalf. She deposes that it was the practice of complainant to take blank cheques as security.However, if we see her cross-examination, then it is clear that she had no documentary evidence to support her statements in examination-in-chief. Accused also states that she had given two cheques to complainant. One was in respect of her contribution and another was for AW1 Pratibha. They both have not what was the duration of that fund and when it was suppose to end. Why accused should give a blank cheque for AW 1 Pratibha is also not known. They do not claim to be friends of each other. If that so called chit fund was illegal, then AW 1 and accused were the participants of such illegal transaction and would support each other in such situation. AW 1 Pratibha says that she had paid all the installments. If that is so, then why that cheque was not taken back is a question, which has not been answered by both of them. AW 1 Pratibha says that accused had not paid all the installments and amount which was due from her to complainant towards purchase of sarees. Even then that transaction could have been covered in one cheque. Why accused should allow complainant to retain both the cheques? If we peruse the notice reply Exhibit-47 given by accused, then it can be seen that there is no whisper about amount due towards purchase of sarees. Thus, it can be seen that the defence has been taken as per the convenience, without any base. Learned Trial Judge ought not to have relied on such kind of evidence which is not supported by any document. Notice reply Exhibit-47 also states that the said cheques were given prior to three years and she had stopped paying amount of chit fund about one year prior to that date. She had requested the complainant to return the cheques. If we see the contents, then it is clear that the relationship between accused and complainant was no longer cordial. In such situation, whether accused would have allowed complainant to retain two cheques? The cheque has been returned with remark 'Funds Insufficient' and not as 'stopped by drawer'. Accused had not taken any legal action to prevent alleged misuse of her cheque, which should have been her natural conduct. Hence, the defence taken by her is unbelievable.At the cost of repetition it can be said that accused is admitting issuance of disputed cheque Exhibit-37 and, therefore, reliance can be placed on the decision in M/S. Shree Daneshwari Traders vs. Sanjay Jain [CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS.61-62 OF 2011 decided on 21 August, 2019] wherein it has been held that, \"Under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, once the cheque is issued by the drawer, a presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in favour of the holder would be attracted. Section 139 creates a statutory presumption that a cheque received in the nature referred to under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability. The initial burden lies upon the complainant to prove the circumstances under which the cheque was issued in his favour and that the same was issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt\".Even otherwise also complainant has discharged the initial burden in this case by showing that she had the source of income. It is not the case of accused that complainant had no capacity to extend hand loan.. Now it has been harped upon by the accused that the said transaction has not been accounted for. In other words, complainant has not shown the said transaction in her Income-Tax returns.  Thus, when in a subsequent pronouncements this Court has clarified the legal position that too, after taking note of subsequent pronouncement by Hon'ble Supreme Court, then the later decision would prevail. It has been then observed in Bipin Thakkars' case that, \"It is true that merely because amount advanced is not shown in Income-Tax return, in every case, one cannot jump to the conclusion that the presumption under Section 139 of said Act stands rebutted\".In the light of the observations of the Apex Court, it cannot but be said that Section 269-SS of the Income Tax Act only provided for the mode of acceptance of payment or repayment in certain cases so as to counteract evasion of tax. Section 269-SS does not declare all transactions of loan, by cash in excess of Rs. 20,000/- as invalid, illegal or null and void, while as observed by the Apex Court, the main object of introducing the provision was to curb and unearth black money. To construe Section 269-SS of the Income Tax Act as a competent enactment declaring as illegal and unenforceable all transactions of loan, by cash, beyond Rs. 20,000/-, in my opinion, cannot be countenanced.In that if a person takes or accepts any loan or deposit in contravention of Section 269-SS is liable to pay, by way of penalty, a sum equal to the amount of the loan or deposit so taken or accepted, as may be imposed by the Joint Commissioner.The contravention of Section 269-SS of the Income Tax Act though visited with a stiff penalty on the person taking the loan or deposit, nevertheless, the rigor of Section 271-D of the Income Tax Act is whittled down by Section 273-B of the Income Tax Act, on proof of bonafides. It cannot, therefore, be said that the transaction of the nature brought before this court could be declared illegal, void, and unenforceable.Though the facts and issue involved in above case was different, but the purpose and scope of those sections under Income-Tax Act as explained by Hon'ble Supreme Court would support the decision in Krishna Morajkar (supra).Therefore, in this case also, accused cannot take benefit of such infraction by complainant to show the transaction in Income-Tax returns. Complainant in this case had the capacity to advance the said amount to accused. Thus, from the complaint and the deposition of the complainant/appellant the factum of giving of loan stands established. Complainant had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the disputed cheque Exhibit-37 was issued by the accused towards the \"legally enforceable debt or liability\".Presumption under Section 139 of N.I. Act was in favour of complainant. Though accused has adduced evidence in rebuttal, however, she has failed to discharge the said presumption.. Complainant had issued statutory notice within statutory period. It was replied by accused but not complied with within the statutory period and, therefore, this Court holds the accused guilty for committing offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act. The view taken by the learned Magistrate thereby acquitting the accused is erroneous and not based on sound legal principles. Hence, interference is required at the hands of this Court. Though the legal principle is that merely because two views are possible, the appellate Court should not take contrary view; but as aforesaid the learned Magistrate had not scanned the evidence properly with sound legal principles and, therefore, interference is required. In other words, this Court is well aware that accused was acquitted by the learned Trial Judge; and ordinarily the appellate Court would cautious while setting aside the said acquittal. Therefore, after taking note of the said ratio laid down in those catena of judgments, this Court has every power to re-appreciate, review and reconsider the evidence. After re-appreciating the evidence as above, the conclusion has been drawn that the judgment of acquittal rendered by the learned Trial Court is perverse. Now, when this Court has respondent/accused guilty of committing offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act, the further act would ensue regarding imposition of quantum of punishment.It is clear from the aims and object for the enactment of Negotiable Instruments Act, that the penal provision was introduced to enhance the acceptability of cheque in settlement of liabilities by making the drawer liable for penalties in case of bouncing of cheques due to insufficiency of funds in the accounts or for the reason that it exceeds the arrangements made by the drawer. Honest drawers' interest who issue cheques is safeguarded in the Act itself.Taking into consideration the above legal position, awarding jail sentence to the respondent/accused may not be in the interest of justice. Here, the appellant would also be interested in getting her amount back. Therefore, payment of compensation under Section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the complainant would be in the interest of justice. The punishment that can be awarded for an offence under Section 138 of N.I. Act is \"imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or both\" (stress supplied by me). The next step would be what could be the amount of fine. Here the cheque Exhibit-37 was drawn for Rs. 80,000/-. The complaint was filed in the year 2013 after the statutory notice. The amount became due to complainant from the date of notice. Accused has utilized the said amount till today. Therefore, some amount needs to be given to her above the cheque amount towards interest. The rate of interest in Banks has gone down now a days, therefore, the said rate cannot be equal to the rate granted in R. Vijayans' case (Supra). Order accordingly",

Bharath Kumar, for respondent are present. . With the consent of the learned counsel appearing for the parties, matter is taken up for final disposal. The petition is presented under Section 397 read with Section 401 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 against the Judgment dated 02.02.2015 passed by the Presiding Officer, Fast Track Court-XV, Bangalore, in Criminal Appeal No.294/2012 wherein the appeal came to be dismissed, thereby the Judgment passed by the trial Court came to be confirmed. In order to avoid confusion and overlapping, the parties are referred to in accordance with the rankings held by them in the trial Court. . The substance of the complaint is that the accused approached the complainant for financial assistance in the form of hand loan during the month of November - 2007 for Rs. 5,75,000/- for his urgent business purpose and the complainant advanced the same to the accused on 21.11.2007. The amount was lent in the form of cash. Accused agreed to repay the amount within two years, but he committed default, however, he issued a Cheque bearing No.763105 dated 03.04.2010 for a sum of Rs. 5,75,000/- drawn on ABN AMRO Bank, Prestige Towers, Residency Road, Bangalore. On presentation of the said Cheque for encashment by the complainant in his collecting banker - Bank of India, the said Cheque was dishonored and returned on 05.04.2010 with an endorsement as \"Account Closed\".  The complainant issued a legal notice on 27.04.2010. In spite of legal notice got issued, neither the amount was repaid nor the terms of the notice were complied. Accordingly, a criminal case came to be presented against the accused on 21.05.2010. . After taking cognizance of the offence, on summons accused appeared and pleaded not guilty and came to be tried the complainant adduced the evidence as PW1 and got marked the documents Exs.P1 to P7. On behalf of accused, the accused was examined as DW1 and an Electricity Bill was marked as Ex.D1. 9. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, accused preferred an appeal in Crl.A. No.294/2014 before the appellate Court that came to be dismissed and the judgment passed by the trial Court came to be confirmed. Aggrieved by it, the present revision is preferred by the accused.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 8. The learned trial Judge after hearing, allowed the complaint and passed order as under:\\n\\n'Acting U/s.255(2) Cr.P.C., the accused is convicted for the offence punishable U/s.138 of N.I. Act.\\n\\nThe accused shall pay a fine of Rs. 5,80,000/-. In default of payment of said fine amount, the accused shall undergo simple imprisonment for Six Months.\\n\\nOut of the said amount, Rs. 5,75,000/- shall be paid to the complainant as compensation, as provided U/s.357 of Cr.PC., and Rs. 5,000/- shall be remitted to the State as fine.'\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Learned counsel Sri Ismail Musba for the accused/petitioner would submit that the complainant is not entitled for the relief prayed for by him nor the accused to undergo liability.  He would further submit that the de novo trial should have been the substance of the case and it is no where applicable for a subsequent Magistrate to rely on the evidence on record. In this regard, he relied on Section 262 of Cr.P.C., and the decisions of Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:  Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner-accused submitted that the case falls on another material lapse, whereas the accused is not examined under Section 313 of Cr.P.C.,\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Learned counsel for the complainant refuting the stand taken by the petitioner, would submit that a legally enforceable debt was existed. Accused issued a Cheque that came to be dishonored. In the circumstances, there is presence of all the ingredients for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act (for short 'N.I. Act') and the legal objections raised by the counsel for the petitioner is not tenable.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  In the context and circumstances of the case, basically there is a complaint for the offence under Section 138 of N.I. Act, which came to be filed against the petitioner. The Cheque bearing No.763105 dated 03.04.2010 for Rs. 5,75,000/- issued by the petitioner was presented to the Bank by the complainant for payment and it came to be dishonored and the legal notice was issued by the complainant to the petitioner. As the accused neither replied nor repaid the Cheque amount within stipulated time, a criminal case was instituted. Evidence was adduced by the complainant and the accused as stated above.  Ultimately the accused came to be convicted by the trial Judge, which came to confirmed by the appellate Court by dismissing the appeal filed by the accused/petitioner. The contention of the petitioner/accused earlier has been that he has obtained a LIC policy and he had issued a Cheque. However, no details of policy amount, premium amount and even duration are mentioned. As such it appears that such a defence is taken for the sake of defence without there being any substance in it.  Before this Court, the learned counsel for the accused/petitioner submits that the evidence was recorded by the Magistrate in the trial Court and the judgment was pronounced and the appreciation was by the Successor Magistrate. As such the enquiry is vitiated. He relied upon Sections 362 and 326 of Cr.P.C. He would further stress that under Section 461 of Cr.P.C., the proceedings are vitiated as there is material irregularity. He also relied upon the citations referred supra and submitted the case falls on material lapse that the accused was not examined under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. I find the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner/accused has no legal force in it.  Further insofar as the contention of the petitioner/accused that the Magistrate has not examined the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C., is concerned, the examination of the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. is an important stage in criminal proceedings and non-examination definitely would imply either there are no incriminating scircumstances against the accused or it is left as lapse.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case revolves around the interpretation and application of Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, specifically in relation to the presumption arising from the issuance of a dishonoured cheque and the burden of proof on the complainant. The lower court acquitted the respondent based on the arguments that the complainant failed to prove the legally enforceable debt or liability and that the amount in question was an unaccounted cash amount. \n\nWhile the lower court's decision is based on the legal principles set forth in Sanjay Mishra vs. Kanishka Kapoor @ Nikki and K Subramani Vs. K. Damodara Naidu, it failed to consider the subsequent decision in Rangappa vs. Sri Mohan, 2010 (4) Bom. C. R. 652 (SC) which overruled the previous decisions. The Rangappa case clarified that a legally enforceable debt need not be proved by adducing evidence of the source of income from which the alleged loan was given. In this case, the complainant produced herself as a witness and produced certain documents in support of her claim. The respondent did not dispute the fact that the cheque was issued, and the presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act arose. \n\nThe respondent's argument that the amount in question was an unaccounted cash amount and not a legally enforceable debt is not supported by the evidence presented. The complainant's case is that the respondent took a loan from her to run her business, which is a legitimate business activity. The respondent failed to provide any evidence to disprove the complainant's claim. Therefore, the presumption under Section 138 of the N.I. Act stands unrebuked. \n\nConsidering the legal principles and evidence presented in the case, the initial ruling by the lower court is incorrect. The appeal should be allowed, and the respondent should be convicted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nFour cheques were issued after execution of Agreement to Sale, dated 04/10/2005 [Exh.57]. They were issued by the accused/respondent in favour of the appellant/complainant. The parties will be referred to as per their original status. The complainant filed one case bearing S.C.C. No.16740/2006 for non- payment towards three cheques. S.C.C. No.77/2006 was filed in respect of non-payment of one cheque. The grievance of the accused is \"the complainant has not cooperated in obtaining N.O.C. from the Town Planning Department. Even accused sought the complainant's cooperation vide letter, dated 24/06/2006 [Exh.60]. Whereas, complainant contend that entire responsibility is of accused. The complainant has deposited three cheques for realization prior to receipt of the said letter. Whereas, admittedly, the fourth cheque was deposited after receipt of the said letter. All the four cheques were dishonoured for the reason \"stopped payment by the drawer\". Vide letter dated 07/02/2006, the accused informed to his banker to stop the payment. For the first three cheques, the complainant issued a notice, dated 25/07/2006 [Exh.45].  The accused denied the liability and informed the complainant vide reply, dated 03/08/2006 [Exh.47]. As there was a failure to make the payment, the complainant filed S.C.C. No.16740/2006 for three cheques. The forth cheque was deposited and the outcome was the same i.e. it was dishonoured. There was a demand to pay as per the notice dated 21/09/2006 [Exh.28]. The accused denied the liability vide reply dated 05/10/2006 [Exh.31], as there was a failure to pay, S.C.C. No.77/2006 was filed.  The complainant examined himself. The accused examined representative from Sub- Registrar Office. This was in case of S.C.C. No.16740/2006. Whereas, the complainant filed a separate affidavit of S.C.C. No.77/2006. The accused has chosen not to cross-examine separately in this case, but adopted the cross-examination taken in the first case. No witnesses were examined in this case It is the turn of the accused to take the matter to the District Court. She filed two separate appeals i.e. Criminal Appeal No.161/2009 (for three cheques) and Criminal Appeal No.162/2009. She succeeded in the appeals.   Learned Advocate Shri Patil argued for the complainant, whereas learned Advocate Shri Bhambhurkar argued for the accused. They also relied upon some of the judgments. With their assistance, I have perused the record. The case mainly rests on the documentary evidence. The accused while cross-examining the complainant had shown him various documents. They were admitted by the complainant and accordingly they were exhibited in the evidence. Some of the documents (photocopies) filed before the trial Court were not exhibited. In spite of that, the first Appellate Court has considered them. On this specific point, even I have heard both the learned Advocates on 24/01/2020. They were admitted this position. In view of that, I am unable to consider that document and the relevant observations by the first appellate Court also cannot be considered. I will deal with them in subsequent part of my order.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe learned Advocate for the complainant emphasized on the following points : (a) Fulfillment of the obligations by the complainant when he executed Agreement to Sale [Exh.57] and Agreement of Development and Sale - Tri-Party Agreement [Exh.58] in favour of the accused. (b) Cancellation of Power of Attorney given to him by the owner on 24/01/2006 [Exh.56] and corresponding execution of fresh Power of Attorney by the owner in favour of the accused [Exh.59]. (c) Thereafter, nothing remains to be done from the side of complainant. (d) The grievance for non-cooperation in obtaining Town Planning sanction is without any basis. (e) Complainant's responsibility is only to advise the accused in obtaining Town Planning sanction, whereas all the expenses are to be borne by the accused (a term on page No.3 on the agreement dated 04/10/2005)\nArgument by the Respondent:\n As against this, the learned Advocate for the accused has made following submissions : (a) Non-disclosure by complainant about the previous transaction of sale by the owner in favour of Maa Vaishnavi Gruh Nirman Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit. (b) Cancellation of Power of Attorney executed in her favour by the complainant. (c) Not transferring the title as agreed as per Deed of Assignment. (d) Not-cooperating in obtaining Town Planning sanction\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nAfter trial, the learned Magistrate, Nagpur was pleased to convict the accused for the offences punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act in both these cases. The appellate Court was pleased to set aside the judgment, vide order dated 30/07/2011. It is the correctness of judgment in these two appeals, which is challenged before this Court. The first appellate Court has passed his judgment mainly on the following grounds: (a) The complainant has not transferred the property in favour of the accused and as there is no transfer of title, the liability will not become a liability as contemplated in the Act. (b) There is no case of advancing a friendly loan and as such the liability cannot become a debt. (c) The complainant has not explained for what purpose the four cheques were issued. (d) The complainant has not cooperated in obtaining Town Planning sanction. (e) As per the Deed of Assignment, the complainant has agreed to assign the rights in favour of the accused, but it has not been done (this finding is not supported by proved Deed of Assignment before the trial Court). (f) The original owner has cancelled the Power of Attorney granted in favour of the accused. That is to say the trial Court observed thus - \"when a transaction has been reduced in writing, either by requirement of law, or agreement of the parties, the writing becomes the exclusive memorial thereof, and no extrinsic evidence is admissible either to prove independently the transaction, or to contradict, very add to, or subtract from the terms of the documents through the contents of such document may be proved either by primary or secondary evidence. All parol testimony of conversations held between parties, or declarations made by either of them where before or after or at the time of, the completion of a contract, will be rejected, because such evidence would tend to substitute a new and different contract for the one really agreed upon. Extrinsic evidence as to what transpired subsequent to a written contract is not admissible for ascertaining its terms.\"  At the same time, the appellate Court went on to observe about Deed of Assignment, dated 24/01/2006. In paragraph 13 of the impugned judgment, the appellate Court observed thus : \"From the evidence came on record, it appears that on 24/01/2006, agreement for assignment executed between them about said field Rs.12,10,000/- paid by the appellant to the respondent and Rs.13,40,000/- to be paid on or before 24/08/2006 transaction will be completed on or before 24/08/2006 by appellant and respondent was to be executed sale deed in favour of the appellant. The amount paid for agreed consideration is towards consent money relating to said property. The appellate Court in paragraph 21 of the judgment observed :- \"It appears that subsequent development were happened between them in respect of the said field. But, it was not brought in the light by the respondent but same pointed out by the appellant. The respondent suppressed the subsequent development.\" Furthermore, in paragraph 26, the appellate Court observed :- \"It appears that appellant got a title and possession of the said field from the said Society and not from respondent therefore possibility to execute sale deed between the appellant and respondent is end. The appellant paid consideration and purchased the said field. Therefore, no outstanding consideration in respect of the said field therefore the cheques issued cannot be considered as a remaining consideration but they were issued for security. Therefore, they cannot considered for remaining consideration in respect of the said field.\"  SSUANCE OF THE CHEQUES 36] The trial Court held that it was not towards future liability. In para No. 12 it has been observed : \"It is the contention of the accused that she had issued blank signed cheques as security for future transaction. It is requisite to note that the complainant has duly performed his part of the contract mentioned in para 4 on page no.3 in agreement to sale at Exh.57. The accused had entered into the agreement of development and to sale on 24.01.2006 at Exh.58 with the original owner and complainant also party to said agreement as consenter. Upon perusal of the said Development and agreement of sale at Exh.58 it is seen that there is no mention in respect of post dated cheques, issued as consideration to the complainant which were referred to in the agreement to sale between the complainant and accused at Exh.57 last line of para 2 namely.\"  t has been further observed in para No. 14 by the trial Court as \"There is no mention, in the development and agreement to sale at Exh.58 about the cheques at Exh.38 to Exh.40. The accused has failed to specify for which future transaction the said cheques were given blank as security. So also in the notice dated 07/02/2006 at Exh.51, letter dated 24/06/2006 at Exh.60 and the reply to the notice dated 03/08/2006 at Exh.47 she has failed to mention that the cheques were given blank as security for future transaction.\" Whereas, the appellate Court observed in paragraph 16 that - \"It appears from, complaint that appellant issued a cheques as mentioned in above para but in the complaint and evidence of respondent there is no mention that what purpose appellant issued the said cheques to respondent whether they were for remaining consideration or part consideration in that respect pleading is not specific that they were for remaining consideration\". I do not agree to this factual findings recorded by the appellate Court, because in the affidavit, the complainant has deposed - \"Thus, accused entered into agreement to purchase said land from the deponent for the valuable consideration of Rs.25,50,000/- (Rupees Twenty Five Lacs and Fifty Thousand Only) and agreement to sale between deponent and accused reduced in writing on 04/10/2005 and the accused has paid the part payment of Rs.12,10,000/- and as per term and condition of apeal.126.12.jud 25/36 the said agreement accused would be liable to pay balance consideration amount of Rs.13,40,000/- within nine months from the date of agreement. That towards the part payment accused issued cheques in favour of complainant for different amount and of different dates\".  The appellate Court further observed - \"The cheques were used before completing of transaction or executing sale- deed, in any agreement there are no numbers of post dated cheques given to consider that they were for remaining consideration. Therefore, it cannot be said that the cheques were issued for consideration but can be said that they were issued for security as well as before execution of sale deed cannot claim of bounced cheques amount as a consideration\". It has been further observed - \"However, she informed about the \"stop payment\" to the respondent. Therefore, the said cheques issued for future liability as a security because previous cheques returned after paying the amount in cash. Therefore, subsequently cheques also issued for security for future liability.\" The appellate Court in paragraph 32 rightly observed \"In this case, there is no debt due against the accused as a friendly loan or other amount which come in the term of debt, therefore, the case is not come in term of debt\". While dealing with the issue whether the amount will fall under the category 'other liability' the appellate Court observed - \"Therefore, the sale transaction between the parties came to end. Shakuntala sold the said field to another person than appellant therefore the transaction between appellant and respondent is end and no chances to complete sale transaction in future on the base of agreement between them. Therefore, bounced cheques cannot come in the term of other liability.\"\n",
    "Case_Result": "As said above, the case mainly rests on documentary evidence. According to the complainant, even though dispute pertains to property, the liability is created as per the written agreement and the drawer of the cheque is liable to be punished if the cheques are issued in pursuance of the agreement.When cheques are dishonoured due to stop payment instructions, still there is a liability fastened as per the provisions of Section 138 of the N.I. Act. In support of the said contention, the complainant relied upon the judgment in case of M/s. MMTC Limited (page 20, paragraph 23).  It is true that the observations in case of Venkatesh Bhat (supra) can be distinguished as facts are different. The acquittal by the Magistrate Court was not interfered with by the High Court of Karnataka. The main reason was legality of the agreement and factum of issuance of cheque voluntarily was under cloud. There was a grievance of obtaining signatures on the agreement by using threat. This is not the case before us. The accused has never pleaded that she signed on all the agreements and issued cheques in voluntarily. Though many of the judgments (except one) relied upon by the complainant, were delivered at a pre-trial stage. Certainly I will look into the observations made therein. The principles laid down above will be certainly useful while appreciating the evidence adduced before the trial Court.Basically in this case, three persons are involved. One is the original owner Shakuntala Bhamode, second is the complainant Vijay Mohare (who has agreed to purchase the land from the owner) and third is the accused, who has agreed to purchase the land (initially from the complainant and later on from the owner). Admittedly, no sale-deed is executed by the complainant in favour of the accused or sale-deed is executed by the owner through the complainant The sale-deed was executed in between Maa Vaishnavi Gruh Nirman Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit. and the accused later on on 8th June, 2007. Said Maa Vaishnavi Gruh Nirman Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit. purchased the land in question from the original owner vide sale- deed, dated 06/11/2006. Both these sale-deeds were not proved through parties till the first appellate Court has referred to them to certain extent.Initially, the original owner executed the following documents with the complainant: Sr.No. Date and Exhibit Nos. Particulars 1 04-03-2004 (Exh.52) Nissar Patra 2 05-04-2004 (Exh.53) Agreement to Sale. 3 05-04-2004 (Exh.55) General Power of Attorney 4 05-04-2004 (Exh.54) Kabja PatraThe owner agreed to sell the land to the complainant for Rs.6.00 lakhs. On the basis of these documents, the complainant executed two sets of documents with the accused. They are as follows : (i) First Set of Documents executed on 04/10/2005 Copy of Agreement to Sale at Exh.57 (ii) Second set of documents executed on 24/01/2006 (a) Original owner cancelling the power of attorney given to the complainant Exh.56(b) Deed of Agreement of Development-cum-Sale (Tri- party Agreement) and original owner, complainant and the accused are the parties [Exh.58](c) General Power of Attorney by the owner in favour of the accused [Exh.59] (d) Deed of Assignment dated 24/01/2006 in between the complainant and the accused (not exhibited). For appreciating the issue raised by both the sides, it will be material to consider the contents of the proved documents. CONTENTS OF AGREEMENT TO SALE, DATED 04/10/2005 (a) Consideration was Rs.25.00 lakhs. (b) Three cheques amounting to Rs.12.50 lakhs were issued (it is not the subject matter of two cases). (c) Remaining Rs.12.50 lakhs was to be paid within nine months. (d) If the cheques were not enchased, the agreement will be deemed to be cancelled (first appellate Court has given importance to this clause). (e) Postdated cheques for remaining amount of Rs.12.50 lakhs were agreed to be delivered at the time of executing the Power of Attorney and Agreement to Sale and Development. (f) Responsibility to measure the land of complainant and responsibility to get sanction of Town Planning is on the accused. The complainant has agreed to guide her. (g) After receiving Rs.12.50 lakhs, the complainant has agreed to get cancelled Power of Attorney in his favour executed by the owner and agreed to get executed Power of Attorney in his favour from the owner (this term is written by hand). (h) At the same time, the complainant has agreed to get executed an agreement for sale and development in between the owner and the accused for Rs.6.00 lakhs. So also, the complainant has agreed to execute mutual settlement agreement for remaining Rs.6.50 lakhs (this is also hand written). AMOUNT OF CHEQUES 2There is no dispute in between the parties about realization of the first three cheques issued for Rs.12.50 lakhs. Admittedly, the four cheques in question were not issued at the time of execution of these agreements. But, they were agreed to be issued at the time of execution of further agreement. It did happen that those four cheques were issued subsequently. The amount of those four cheques is Rs.13.90 lakhs. Even though it is higher than the remaining amount of consideration of Rs.12.50 lakhs. I do not find any controversy raised on behalf of the accused while defending the cases. The learned Counsel for the complainant tried to explain during oral agreement why there is an increase of Rs.90,000/-.According to him, this Rs.90,000/- includes remaining amount of cheque dishonoured from initially issued three cheques and it also includes an amount of compensation agreed to be paid by the accused due to dishonour of the earlier cheques. As there is no dispute about the amount of Rs.13.90 lakhs, there is no occasion for me to go into that issue. DOCUMENTS EXECUTED ON 24/01/2006 As agreed in the agreement dated 04/10/2005, the complainant has fulfilled some of his promises in the following way : (a) Got cancelled the Power of Attorney from the original owner executed in his favour by a deed [Exh.56]. (b) Instrumental in executing a Tri-party Agreement and Deed of Agreement of Development and Sale [Exh.58]. (c) Got instrumental in executing a power of attorney by the original owner in favour of the accused [Exh.59]. ISSUANCE OF CHEQUEOn this background, accused issued following cheques in favour of the complainant. The details of cheques, cases and appeals are as follows : S.N. Cheque Nos. Date Amount (in Rs.) Case No. First Appeal Present Appeal 1 206202 10-02-2006 1,40,000/- SCC No. 16740/2006 Cri.Appeal No.161/09 Criminal Appeal No.126/12 2 206203 24-04-2006 5,00,000/- SCC No. 16740/2006 Cri.Appeal No.161/09 Criminal Appeal No.126/12 3 206204 24-06-2006 3,00,000/- SCC No. 16740/2006 Cri.Appeal No.161/09 Criminal Appeal No.126/12 4 206205 24-08-2006 4,00,000/- SCC No. 77/2006 Cri.Appeal No.162/09 Criminal Appeal No.127/12  As said above, the first three cheques were deposited earlier to receipt of letter dated 24/06/2006 [Exh.60] protesting about non-cooperation by the complainant in obtaining Town Planning sanction. There is a reason to believe that cheques were deposited earlier to receipt of that letter. But, there is a reason to believe that notice dated 25/07/2006 at Exh.45 was issued after receipt of this letter.Whereas, admittedly notice dated, 05/10/2006 [Exh.28] in respect of dishonour of single cheque was issued after receipt of protest letter, dated 24/06/2006 [Exh.60]. The material issue is, whether the findings of the first appellate Court \"about presumption rebutted by the accused\" is correct or not and whether it is supported by the evidence or not. And, whether the first appellate Court has committed any mistake in appreciating the evidence. SCOPE OF APPEALIt is true that the trial Court convicted the accused, whereas the first appellate Court reversed that decision. Against the decision of acquittal in a complainant case, the appeal lies to this court under the provisions of sub-section (4) to Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Be that the order of Magistrate Court or of Additional Session Judge. It is also true that there is a maxim followed \"judgment of acquittal reinforces the presumption of innocence\". This is not applicable in full force when there is a special defence taken by the accused or when case rests on documentary evidence. Present appeal falls under second category. Hence, this Court can certainly re-appreciate the evidence and ascertain the correctness of the finding with a wide approach. CONSIDERATION The defence taken by the accused is already reiterated in earlier part of the judgment. The complainant is the sole witness. Accused examined a representative from Sub-Registrar Office. The original owner cancelled the Power of Attorney granted in favour of the accused unilaterally. This compelled the accused to file civil suit against the original owner. The accused was cautious enough to give lis pendens notice to the Office of Sub-Registrar, Saoner. To prove this fact, defence witness was examined. This happened in S.C.C. No.16740/2006. Whereas, in S.C.C. No.77/2006, accused has adopted earlier cross-examination and not examined defence witnesses independently. CERTAIN INCORRECT FINDINGS With the assistance of both the learned Advocates, I have read the findings given by the trial Court as well as by the appellate Court. It is no doubt true that the case is mainly based on documentary evidence. The trial Court, while holding accused guilty, has considered contents of some of the documents and has given them predominance over oral evidence. These observations were made by the trial Court while making comments on commitment of complaint to get Town Planning sanction. On this issue, I do not find any observations by the appellate Court. The trial Court committed one mistake. It was observed in paragraph 11 that \"In the present case, it has not come on record that the complainant was aware of the stop payment directions prior to the presentation of the cheques.\". However, the trial Court has forgotten one fact that the protest letter [Exh.60] (though not received prior to deposit of three cheques) was received prior to deposit of forth cheque.It is a matter of record that the Deed of Assignment is not proved before the trial Court. Specifically on this issue, I have heard the arguments of both the learned Advocates on 24/01/2020. Fairly they have admitted that the Deed of Assignment is not proved during evidence. Furthermore, the appellate Court made certain comments on subsequent development. There are two sale-deeds referred during oral arguments before me. They are as follows : 1) Sale-Deed dated 06/11/2006 in between the original owner and Maa Vaishnavi Gruh Nirman Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit. 2) Sale-Deed dated 12/06/2007 in between Maa Vaishnavi Gruh Nirman Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit and the accused. Accused wants to make a point that complainant has not transferred land in favour of the accused, but accused herself got it transferred from Maa Vaishnavi Gruh Nirman Sahakari Sanstha Maryadit. In such a manner, the accused has not fulfilled his promises. But, the appellate Court lost sight of the fact that the subsequent sale-deeds were not tendered in evidence. So also, it is not admitted fact. What I gather is, the appellate Court was influenced by the oral arguments canvassed before him and while doing that, the evidence before the trial Court was not perused. Even, the oral arguments before me also tempted me to decide the appeal on factors which are not part of record. But, I have not succumbed to that and decided these appeals on the basis of strict record. With this view in mind, I have read the record.On reading them, I find that some of the observations of the trial Court are right. But, on certain aspects, I do not agree with the trial Court. So the conclusion about guilt drawn by the trial Court is not acceptable to me. I will give reasons for that. Whereas, I also do not agree with some of the observations of the appellate Court. Still, I agree to the conclusion about acquittal drawn by the appellate Court. I am not intending to interfere in the impugned judgment. I will give reason for that. While concluding that the amount will not fall under 'other liability', the appellate Court weighed the circumstances in favour of the accused. One is the property not transferred by the complainant in favour of the accused. Second is, society transferring the title in favour of the accused. I do not agree to this conclusion drawn by considering these two circumstances. Because, we cannot consider it as a lapse on the part of the complainant and there is no documentary evidence suggesting that responsibility on the complainant. The second circumstance also cannot be considered for the same reason. The sale-deed is not on record. Whereas I agree to the observations made by the trial Court about fulfillment of the promises by the complainant. Trial Court observed \"Thus the complainant has complied with his part of the agreement to sale entered with the accused at Exh.57 at para 4 page No.3\". While making this observations, trial Court has considered certain factors. One is Deed of Cancellation of Power of Attorney in between owner and the accused [Exh.56]. Second is execution of General Power of Attorney by the owner in favour of the accused [Exh.59]. On this background, trial Court rightly concluded about fulfillment of promises by the complainant. This has not been looked in to by the appellate Court. On this aspect, the appellate Court considered this factor while answering the issue of liability against the complainant. Power of Attorney is cancelled in two modes. One is, by the original owner given in favour of the complainant. Fact of cancellation is correct but its correlation to hold non-proof of liability is not correct. Because this cancellation is mutual in between owner and the complainant. Second is cancellation by owner granted in favour of the accused. It is considered by the appellate Court and not rightly. Because there is no evidence on record to that effect. Whereas, the findings of trial Court are correct. Accused examined representative from the Sub-Registrar Office. Through her notice of lis pendens is proved. Trial Court rightly observed that accused has not entered into witness box. Hence contents of sale- deed dated 06/11/2006 at Exh.77 cannot be read (para 13). These are correct observations. I am also not inclined to consider it as a factor against the complainant. This issue was harped upon by the accused before this Court. I do not find any observations of the appellate Court. Trial Court has opined about this issue in paragraph 8. Trial Court has also reproduced the contents of the Agreement to Sale at Exh.57 (para 8). I am also reproducing it for ready reference as - Trial Court has differentiated in between responsibility of the complainant and the accused. It is true that the responsibility of the complainant is only to give guidance whereas that of accused is to incur all expenses. It is true that accused vide letter dated 24/06/2006 [Exh.60] has protested about non- cooperation of the complainant. She has laid emphasis on the importance of sanction in development of the property. The bifurcation of responsibilities done by the trial Court is correct. The job of the complainant is only to give guidance. So, whether the complainant is to be blamed if he has not given guidance? Whether his failure is sufficient to relieve the accused from his responsibility to honour the commitment of cheques? Trial Court has answered in the negative. Whereas the appellate Court has not given any opinion.Trial Court has given its finding on the basis of documents. Trial Court has also said that prior to deposit of cheques (that is first three), the complainant was not aware of stop payment instructions. It is a matter of record that letter stopping payment given to drawee bank is not exhibited. Cheque return memo only refers about it. The said letter is not sent to the complainant. What is sent, is protest letter about non- cooperation.It is true that the trial Court has minimized the responsibility of the complainant only in giving advise. But trial Court has not said anything about what advise given by the complainant. For that purpose, we can go through the contemporaneous record. It includes notice dated 25/07/2006 [Exh.45] and the affidavit of evidence. But surprisingly in both of them, the complainant has not said anything. The complainant has even not referred to the letter dated 24/06/2006 [Exh.60]. So when the complainant has not said anything about 'any advise given' will it be proper to give him benefit of fulfilling that promise. The answer is certainly 'no'. Whether the complainant has given the advise or not is a question of evidence. Even the complainant does not say that he has replied to that letter. The complainant had only chosen not to make any comment on that letter. This inaction of the complainant certainly goes against him. Appellate Court has not paid attention to this aspect (in stead it commented on certain issues which is not a part of record).It is true that it has been interpreted in the case of M/s. Womb Laboratories (supra) that cheques issued as security are also covered by the provisions of N.I. Act. Accused has agreed to pay remaining amount of Rs.12,50,000/- (later on increased to Rs.13,90,000/-) within 9 months. (as per agreement dated 04/10/2005) [Exh.57]. There is a clause in that agreement. It says of cancellation of the agreement if cheque not encashed. The appellate Court has given benefit of this clause to the accused. It is not correct. Because the accused himself is the drawer of the cheques and he cannot take the benefit of her own wrong of dishonouring the cheque and pleading for recession of the agreement.. There may be various kinds of agreements consisting of promises and sets of promises. The agreement at Exh.57 consists of promise given by the accused to pay Rs.12,50,000/- within 9 months. There was also a promise on behalf of complainant to guide the accused in obtaining town planning sanction. The complainant has fulfilled the promise of (a) cancelling his power of attorney; (b) fresh power of attorney in favour of the accused and (c) executing agreement for sale and development. It is very well true that fulfillment of promise by the complainant is correlated to fulfillment of corresponding promise by the accused.  Basically, the accused has made grievance of non- fulfillment of two promises by the complainant. One is not transferring the title. As said above deed of assignment (which contains this promise) is not exhibited. This restrains me from making any observation. Appellate Court has not put that restraint on him. Appeal dismissed",

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe core legal issue in this case revolves around the interpretation of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act in relation to the bounced cheques issued by the respondent (accused) in payment for a property purchase agreement. The lower court ruled that the respondent was convicted for the offences punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act in both the cases. The respondent is challenging this decision in the appeal.\n\nAssessing the lower court's judgment, it appears that the lower court correctly established that there was no transfer of title as agreed upon in the Deed of Assignment. Therefore, the liability would not become a liability as contemplated in the Act. Furthermore, the lower court rightly concluded that there was no case of advancing a friendly loan and as such, the liability cannot become a debt. The respondent's argument about the cancellation of the Power of Attorney and non-cooperation in obtaining Town Planning sanction were not supported by the evidence presented.\n\nHowever, the lower court erred in dismissing the evidence of the Deed of Assignment, Exh.58, and the Deed of Agreement to Sale, Exh.57. These documents clearly showed that the respondent had entered into an agreement to purchase the land from the complainant for a valuable consideration. The respondent had also paid part of the consideration amount as agreed upon in the agreement. The lower court's dismissal of these documents was not in accordance with the law.\n\nIn light of this, the appeal should be allowed. The respondent's conviction for the offences punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act should be set aside, as the respondent had entered into a valid agreement to purchase the land from the complainant. The respondent had paid part of the consideration amount as agreed upon in the agreement. Therefore, the respondent had a valid claim for the balance amount, which was due as per the agreement. The bounced cheques issued by the respondent were in payment for this outstanding balance, making them valid instruments under the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe present appeal has been preferred by Anuj Khanna (hereinafter referred to as 'Appellant'). He was an Ex-Director of Cosmic Export Solutions (India) Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as 'Corporate Debtor). The Appeal is preferred under section 61 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (hereinafter referred to as 'I&B Code') challenging the impugned order dated 13th February, 2020 passed by National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai Bench (hereinafter referred as 'Adjudicating Authority') in Company Petition No. C.P. No. 2431/I&BP/2019. The brief facts of the case are that the Corporate Debtor had engaged the Respondent No. 1/Operational Creditor for its custom clearance services. The Corporate Debtor availed the services of the Operational Creditor from 2015 till 2019. The Operational Creditor filed a petition before the Adjudicating Authority dated 24th June, 2019, seeking to set in motion the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) alleging that the Corporate Debtor committed a default in making payment of Rs. 18,09,541/- including interest at the rate of 24% p.a., by invoking the provisions of section 8 and 9 of I&B Code. The below paragraphs reproduced below has been taken from the legal notice dated 28th March, 2019 which states as follows: \"Your attention is invited to the fact that on you no. 4 who is the owner of M/s Wihswanaveen Traders, business firm, request, our clients made the payment to you in your respective personal accounts, detail as under:-\\n\\n(1) Mr. Shailendra Yadav (Rs. 8,81,000/-)\\n\\n(2) Mr. Manoj Prajapati (Rs. 1,69,000/-)\\n\\n(3) Mr. Raghav Malhotra (Rs. 3,27,000/-)\\n\\n(4) Mr. Nitin Dhawan (Rs. 40,000/-)\\n\\nAggregating to Rs. 14,17,000/- (Rupees Fourteen Lakhs Seventeen Thousand Only).\\n\\n\"You are further being informed that your act of not showing in your books of the above money towards M/s Wishwanaveen traders also amount to criminal act such as misrepresentation, fraud, misconduct, criminal breach of trust under the provisions of Indian penal Code and our Clients are very much determined to take this matter to Megistrate Court for your such acts, which our Clients will assumed of doing so, if there is no reply from your end within 7 days from the date of this notice, and the punishment under the above provisions does call for more than 2 years imprisonment.\"\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe learned counsel for the Appellant stated that the Corporate Debtor had regularly paid the Operational Creditor all the amounts that were due to be paid to the Operational Creditor for its services during the aforesaid period. Pertinently, at the request of the Operational Creditor certain payment were also made to the employees of the Operational Creditor, namely Mr Shailendra Yadav (8,81,000/-), Mr. Manoj Prajapati (Rs. 1,69,000/-), Mr. Raghav Malhotra (Rs. 3,27,000/-) and Mr. Nitin Dhawan (Rs. 40,000/-). The learned counsel for the Appellant further stated that on discovering anomalies between the demands made by the Operational Creditor and the accounts maintained by the Corporate Debtor, the Corporate Debtor requested the Operational Creditor for the ledger books and bank statements with respect to the monetary transactions between the parties, particularly made to the employees of the Operational Creditor. The Operational Creditor failed to provide relevant ledger books and bank statements to the Corporate Debtor with respect to monetary transactions between the parties. However, in an attempt to reconcile the accounts and resolve the disputes, the Corporate Debtor held a meeting with the proprietor of the Operational Creditor (namely Nitin Dhawan) on 2nd March, 2019 whereby the Operational Creditor was made clear that the payments to the tune of Rs. 14,17,000/- were made to the employees of the Operational Creditor. In the said meeting, the said proprietor of the Operational Creditor had also agreed to provide the entire ledger books and bank statements with respect to the monetary transactions between the parties. Since, the Operational Creditor again failed to provide the ledger account and bank statements, the Corporate Debtor decided to suspend the services of the Operational Creditor with immediate effect. 5. It is also stated by the learned counsel for Appellant that the Corporate Debtor addressed an email dated 5th March, 2019 thereby informing the Operational Creditor regarding the suspension of its services by the Corporate Debtor with immediate effect for the following reasons:\n\ni. Non-professional attitude.\n\nii. Mala fide intentions in pursuing the business.\n\niii. Failure to send ledger books and bank statements to the Corporate Debtor 6. It is also stated on behalf of the Appellant that by way of the said email dated 5th March, 2019, the Corporate Debtor had informed the Operational Creditor that Operational Creditor had received cheque payments amounting to Rs. 14,17,000/- from the Corporate Debtor for which receipts had not been received by the Corporate Debtor. On 6th March, 2019 the Corporate Debtor addressed a Legal Notice to the Operational Creditor thereby seeking the ledger books and bank statements with respect to the monetary transactions between the parties.  It is submitted by the learned counsel for the Appellant that during the course of the business, the Corporate Debtor had issued certain blank un-dated cheques to the Operational Creditor as security, a practice that is prevalent in business to secure debts. The Operational Creditor, acting with mala fide intention presented the cheques after filling in amounts not legally recoverable by it. The said cheques were dishonoured for 'insufficient funds' in the Corporate Debtor's bank account on 22nd February, 2019. The Corporate Debtor was not expecting the cheques to be deposited and therefore the arrangement to keep sufficient balance in the account was not made by it. Since, the alleged principal amount of Rs. 14,59,308/- had already been paid to the Operational Creditor, the deposit of cheques amounting to Rs. 4,01,049/- by the Operational Creditor was mala fide and erroneous.  It is further submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the Operational Creditor did not send any notice under section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 after the cheques were dishonoured but waited to represent the said cheques for the second time again on 20th March, 2019. Consequently, the cheques were returned by the concerned bank with remark 'Payment Stopped by The Drawer'. t is also submitted on behalf of the Appellant that the Corporate Debtor addressed a legal notice dated 28th March, 2019 to the Operational Creditor again requesting for the ledger books and bank statement with respect to the monetary transactions between the parties. Pertinently, the Corporate Debtor, by way of the said notice had informed the Operational Creditor that an amount of 14,17,000/- was paid to the employees of the Operational Creditor for which receipts were not issued by the Operational Creditor. The content of legal notice dated 28th March, 2019 have neither been replied nor refuted by the Operational Creditor.  It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the Appellant that on 17th April, 2019, the Operational Creditor addressed a Legal Notice to the Corporate Debtor under section 138 & 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 thereby claiming an amount of Rs. 4,01,049/-. On 22nd April, 2019, the Operational Creditor issued a demand notice to the Corporate Debtor thereby raising a demand of Rs. 18,09,541.92/- which purportedly consisted of principal default amount of Rs. 14,59,308/- and interest of Rs. 3,50,233.02/-. On 2nd May, 2019 the Corporate Debtor replied to Legal Notice dated 17th April, 2019 thereby clearly stating that the Corporate Debtor had issued the cheques as security and hence the Operational Creditor ought not to have presented it to the bank. Further, by way of the said Reply the Corporate Debtor called upon the Operational Creditor to return the said cheque. On 16th May, 2019, the Corporate Debtor replied to the Demand notice dated 22nd April, 2019 sent by the Operational Creditor thereby again informing the Operational Creditor that an amount of Rs, 14,17,000/- was paid to the employees of the Operational Creditor and the receipt against such payments have not been issued by the Operational Creditor. Learned Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that on 19th June, 2019 thereby acknowledging the receipt of the amount of Rs. 14,17,000/- from the Corporate Debtor and stating for the first time that the said amount was paid by the Corporate Debtor to the Operational Creditor's employees towards the out of pocket expenses.  12. It is contended on behalf of the Appellant that the Operational Creditor had not adduced in support of its contention that the payment of Rs, 14,17,000/- was made towards the out of pocket expenses. In fact, the out of pocket expenses actually incurred by the Operational Creditor are mentioned in the invoices under the heading of 'Non-receipt Charges' and hence there could not have been any other amount towards out of pocket expenses that is payable by the Appellant to the Operational Creditor apart from what is mentioned in the invoices. Notably, the repeated requests may by the Appellant to the Operational Creditor, for the ledger books, fell to deaf ears.  Thus, the repayment of the principal amount can be clearly inferred from the Operational Creditor's own admission and thus the claim of principal amount of Rs. 14,59,308/- is erroneous and no interest is liable to be paid there upon  It is further contended by the learned counsel for the Appellant that the Adjudicating Authority has clearly ignored the fact of existence of a dispute between the parties prior to the demand notice dated 22nd April, 2019 issued by the Operational Creditor under section 8 of I&B Code. The communication exchanged between the parties prior to the demand notice are as follows: E-mail dated 5th March, 2019 addressed by the Appellant to the Operational Creditor indicating suspension of work and payment of an amount of Rs. 14,17,000/-.\n\nii. Legal Notice dated 6th March, 2019 addressed by lawyer of the Appellant to the Operational Creditor requesting reconciliation of accounts.\n\niii. Legal Notice dated 28th March, 2019 addressed by the lawyer of the Appellant to the Respondent No. 1 indicating inter alia wrongful presentation of cheques by Respondent No. 1 since dues already paid and work suspended.\n\niv. Legal Notice dated 28th March addressed by lawyer of the Appellant to the employees of the Operational Creditors requesting treatment of amount of Rs. 14,17,000/- deposited in their accounts.\n\nv. Legal Notice dated 17th April, 2019 addressed by the Operational Creditor u/s 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 to the Appellant. . It is further contended by the learned counsel of the Appellant that the said communications would make it abundantly clear that the disputes pertaining to the alleged default in payment of Rs. 14,59,308/- existed prior to the issuance of demand notice. The aforementioned documents in-fact form a part of the application filled by the Operational Creditor before the Adjudicating Authority. . It is also contended by the learned counsel of the Appellant that the Adjudicating Authority have erred in initiating the CIRP of the Corporate Debtor without considering the fact that the unpaid Operational Debt has been admittedly paid. Also, claim of the Operational Creditor to the extent of Rs. 8,68,478/- raised in the Company Petition before the Adjudicating Authority is ex-facie barred by limitation since the Operational Creditor has admitted that the dates of default of the said amount are prior to three years preceding the date of institution of Company Petition i.e. on 24th June, 2019. t is also contended that the Adjudicating Authority has failed to consider that the out of pocket expenses actually incurred by the Operational Creditor is mentioned in the invoice itself under the heading non-receipt charges, hence there could not be any other amount towards out of pocket expenses that is payable by the Corporate Debtor. The Adjudicating Authority failed to appreciate that the onus of proving that the amount of Rs. 14,17,000/- paid by the Corporate Debtor to the employees of the Operational Creditor was towards out of pocket expenses was totally on the Operational Creditor.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nPer contra, learned counsel for Operational Creditor submitted at the outset that the answering respondent had been providing custom clearing services to the Corporate Debtor since 2015. The Operational Creditor issued bills as well as tax invoices with respect to the services provided to the Corporate Debtor.  The Operational Creditor has been maintaining the running ledger account in due course of its business transactions executed with the Corporate Debtor, whereby the Operational Creditor had mentioned and recorded all the financial transactions and the Books of Accounts of the Operational Creditor maintained in the course of business. As of 29th January, 2019, the total outstanding amount due and payable by the Corporate Debtor to the Operational Creditor for the services of the Operational Creditor was Rs. 18,09,541/-, Principal Amount Rs. 14,59,308/- and Rs. 3,50,233.92/- as interest. It was further submitted by the learned counsel for Operational Creditor that in order to partly liquidate the due amount payable to the Operational Creditor, the Corporate Debt issued cheques in favour of Operational Creditor with the assurance that as and when cheques will be presented by the Operational Creditor, the same shall be honoured. However, when Operational Creditor presented the said cheques in order to be encashed, the same got dishonoured on 22nd February, 2019 with the remark \"FUNDS INSUFFICIENT.\"  Thereafter, the son of the proprietor of Operational Creditor had a meeting with the Corporate Debtor on 02nd March, 2019 who assured the Operational Creditor that the cheques should be deposited again on 20th March, 2019. It is also submitted that thereafter, the cheques were again deposited on 20th March, 2019, however, much to their shock, the same were dishonoured with remarks \"PAYMENT STOPPED BY DRAWER\". As the undisputed dues of the Operational Creditor were not cleared by the Corporate Debtor, the Operational Creditor issued a demand notice dated 22nd April, 2019 to the Corporate Debtor, calling upon to clear the dues of the Operational Creditor with interest. 20. It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the Operational Creditor that thereafter, the Operational Creditor filed a petition for insolvency before the Adjudicating Authority wherein the Corporate Debtor did not dispute the invoices and the due amount, but alleged that it had made a payment of Rs. 14,17,000/- to the employees of the Operational Creditor and therefore, the Operational Creditor ought to have given credit to the Corporate Debtor for the same towards the outstanding invoices.  It was also alleged that the Operational Creditor ought to have given credit to the Corporate Debtor for the same towards outstanding invoices. It was further alleged that in their reply that the invoice dated 22nd August, 2015 as well as 19th September, 2016 were not raised on the Corporate Debtor but on a third party under the name of one New Decent Footwear Industries which were not payable by the Corporate Debtor. It was contended by the learned counsel that all such pleas taken by the Corporate Debtor were false, devoid of any merit and an afterthought. 21. It was contended by the Learned Counsel that the answering respondent in their Rejoinder to the reply of the Corporate Debtor submitted that the invoices raised by the Operational Creditor inter alia had the following terms at the foot of the invoices: viz: \"all cheques/demand draft in payment of the bill should be drawn in favour of \"M/S Wishwa Naveen Traders\" on Mumbai Branch only.\"  Therefore, it is submitted that there was no question of the Corporate Debtor making payments to the employees of Operational Creditor and claiming credits for the same. In addition, in the alleged email dated 05th March, 2019, it has not been mentioned anywhere by the Corporate Debtor that the said amount of Rs. 14,17,000/- has been paid to the employees of Operational Creditor. 2. It was further contended on behalf of the Operational Creditor that in the reply sent by the Corporate Debtor dated 02nd May, 2019 to the notice dated 17th April, 2019, the Corporate Debtor had stated that the sum of Rs. 14,17,000/- was paid to the employees of the Operational Creditor in their personal capacity and on the request of the Operational Creditor. However, it is submitted by the learned counsel that neither the Corporate Debtor could show any such request from the Operational Creditor to this effect nor could they show any proof of payment. 3. It was further submitted that it is important to note that the Corporate Debtor had acknowledged that the said alleged payments to the employees were given in their personal capacity and not on account of Operational Creditor. Thus, the alleged defence and the so-called dispute was a spurious defence which is mere bluster. 24. It was further submitted that each of the invoices raised by the Operational Creditor on the Corporate Debtor inter alia had the following terms at the foot of the invoice viz: \"Interest at 24% will be charged for delayed payments'. Therefore, it was submitted that the Corporate Debtor is liable to pay the interest of 24% to the Operational Creditor on the amount of default. 25. It was further contended by the learned counsel for Operational Creditor that there were no instructions from Operational Creditor to make payments towards invoices to a third party or even to the employees of Operational Creditor. The Corporate Debtor failed to produce any written instructions from Operational Creditor to make payments towards the outstanding invoices to the employees. In the email dated 5th March, 2019, the Corporate Debtor acknowledged that they do not have receipts for the said alleged payments which they previously claimed to have been made to the said employees. The Corporate Debtor has not produced any instructions in writing, wherein the Operational Creditor is said to have mentioned that the payments need to be made to the employees. 26. It was further contended by the learned counsel for Operational Creditor that the answering respondent has delivered the Ledger Account from time to time and the Ledge Account is duly acknowledged by one Mr. Arun Khanna, one of the directors of the Corporate Debtor in August, 2018, which again amounts to an admission on the part of the Corporate Debtor towards the liability in respect of the outstanding payable by them to Operational Creditor.  The contents of the confirmation of accounts have not been disputed by the Corporate Debtor. In any event, the Corporate Debtor had not disputed the invoices, thus, based on the invoices itself, it is evident that the Corporate Debtor is in default to make payment to the Operational Creditor. It was thus denied that the Operational Creditor has not provided the ledger to reconcile the accounts as the ledger confirmation provided by the Operational Creditor has the acknowledgement and signatures of the Corporate Debtor.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe Adjudicating Authority through impugned order, initiated the CIRP of the Corporate Debtor by admitting the Operational Debt. Hence the present Appeal is being preferred by the Appellant. The admission of the Operationmal Creditor with regard to payment of unpaid Operational debt is recorded in the impugned order as follows:\n\n\"7. The Corporate Debtor contended that they have made payment to the extent of Rs. 14,17,000/- to four persons who are employees of the Petitioner, and the Petitioner failed to account for the same whereas the Petitioner refutes the same, saying that those payments were towards the out of pocket expenses incurred during the process of customs clearing of Corporate Debtor's goods.\" . The Adjudicating Authority having relied on this paragraph of the aforementioned Judgement and had made the following observation in para 12 of the impugned order which is reproduced as below: - 12. On hearing the arguments of either side and on the going through the pleading that the dispute raised by the Corporate Debtor are not the real disputes and in fact spurious and they doesn't fall under the ambit of section 5(6) of the code, which provides as below:\n\n\"Disputes includes a suit or arbitration proceedings relating to-\n\n(a) The existence of the amount of debt, (b) the quality of goods or service, or (c) the breach of a representation or warranty.\n",
    "Case_Result": ". Having heard to the parties and after perusal of the records the Adjudicating Authority has given the findings that there is a debt and default on the part of the Corporate Debtor. We have gone through the records and observed that there were communications made by the Corporate Debtor to the Operational Creditor requesting for the account ledgers and also asserts that the Operational Creditor have received an amount of Rs. 14,17,000/- through cheque payments, for agency charges for which no receipt has been received by the Corporate Debtor.The Corporate Debtor through its email dated 5th March, 2019 also raised a dispute that in spite of hundreds of reminders were sent to the Operational Creditor, the Corporate Debtor have not received any details in last three years in relation to sending account ledger. The Corporate Debtor not just raised such dispute but also suspended the services of the Operational Creditor stating the grounds of non-professional attitude and malafide intentions in pursuing the business.30. Apart from the aforementioned email the Appellant have also sent two legal notices to the Operational Creditor dated 6th march, 2019 and 28th march, 2019. The paragraphs reproduced below has been taken from the legal notice dated 6th March, 2019 which stated as follows:This Notice is being issued for the reasons as under:\n\nOur Clients have informed us that the relationship between you and our client is of more than 7 years and during all the years our client have been availing services from you and payment was made to you at all the times on regular intervals including payment being made in the personal accounts of your key employees i.e. Mr. Shailendra Yadav (Rs. 8,81,000/-), Mr. Manoj Prajapati (Rs. 1,69,000/-), Mr Raghav (Rs. 3,27,000/-) and yourself (Rs. 40,000/-) aggregating to Rs. 14,17,000/- (Rupees Fourteen Lakhs Seventeen Thousand Only). Please note the laws of India.Our Client have informed us to state that the reason payments of Rs. 14,17,000/- (Rupees Fourteen Lakhs Seventeen Thousand Only) was made to your key employees i.e. Mr. Shailendra Yadav, Mr. Manoj Prajapati and yourself was on your request and there is no other need to make the payment to your key employees i.e. Mr. Shailendra Yadav, Mr. Manoj Prajapati and yourself and hence, we hope that you might have treated that payment as payment against your invoices and business entity and accordingly have been treated in your Ledger as per Accounting principles applicable all over.Under the circumstances, we as instructed by our Clients, hereby call upon you to share the Ledger and also the treatment made to the payment of Rs. 14,17,000/- (Rupees Fourteen Lakhs Seventeen Thousand Only) in your books which was made to your key employees i.e. Mr. Shailendra Yadav, Mr. Manoj Prajapati and yourself within 3 days so that there are no accounting errors at the time of filling Annual Return.31. Once again, on 28th March, 2019 another legal notice was sent to the Operational Debtor, indicating inter alia wrongful presentation of cheques by Operational Creditor since dues were already paid and work was suspended. The said legal notice also asserts to the employees of the Operational Creditors requesting treatment of amount of Rs. 14,17,000/- deposited in their accounts. 32. The Operational Creditor also sent a legal notice dated 17th April, 2019 under section 138 & 141 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881, after the Cheques issued by the Corporate Debtor being returned dishonoured. We Observed that the cheques were first returned dishonoured on 22nd February, 2019 due to \"Insufficient Funds\" and thereafter when the Operational Creditor presented the cheques again for clearance on 20th March, 2019, cheques again returned dishonoured with remark 'Payment Stopped by The Drawer'. This considered course of action taken by the Corporate Debtor is indicative of existence of disputes over payments between the parties. All these email Communications and the legal notices sent by the parties to each other had occurred prior to the issuance of demand notice under section 8 by the Operational Creditor. These sequence of events showed that there was a dispute in existence prior to the issuance of demand notice by the Operational Creditor.The Adjudicating Authority have put its reliance of the aforementioned Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court and concluded that the disputes raised by the Corporate Debtor are not the real dispute and also does not falls within the ambit of Section 5(6) of I&B Code. However, the Adjudicating Authority have not reasonably explained the rationality for not considering this as a real dispute. Also, Section 5(6) of the I&B Code is an inclusive provision and does not confine the Adjudicating Authority from considering the existence of a dispute from a broader angle The intent of Legislature is very vital for interpreting any law, which can be well deduced from the words of Section 8(2)(a) of I&B Code 'existence of a dispute if any'. It can be easily inferred that dispute shall not be limited to instances specified in the definition as provided under Section 5(6), as it has far arms, apart from pending Suit or Arbitration as provided Under Section 5(6) of IBC. The IBC is not a substitute for a recovery forum.. Section 9 of the IBC makes it very clear for the Adjudicating Authority to admit the application \"if no notice of dispute is received by the Operational Creditor and there is no record of the dispute in the information utility.\" Whereas, on the other hand, Section 9 also states that the Adjudicating Authority to reject the application so filed \"if the Operational Creditor has received a notice of a dispute from the Corporate Debtor\".We also want to clarify that the Operational Creditor cannot take recourse that the payment if any made to the employees were in their personal capacity and not on account of Operational Creditor. As it is a well settled principle under Law of Agency that \"where an employee does some wrongful act, within the course of his employment, then for that act the employer's liability shall arise. The employee would be liable for the wrongful act he has done, whereas the employer would be liable vicariously for the act due to the principal-agent relationship between the two. In that situation, the aggrieved person is at the choice whether to sue principal or agent or both. Therefore, fraud committed by any of the employees of the Operational Creditor cannot be said to be done in their personal capacity.From the bare perusal of the impugned order, in Para 7 it is clear that the Operational Creditor has admitted before the Adjudicating Authority that the Corporate Debtor have made the payment of Rs. 14,17,000/- (Rupees Fourteen Lakhs Seventeen Thousand Only), saying that those payments were towards the out of pocket expenses incurred during the process of custom clearing of Corporate Debtor's goods. The onus to prove whether the payment was for out of pocket expenses or for the main services lies on the Operational Creditor. However, the Operational Creditor have considerably failed to prove whether such payment was received for the out of pocket expenses or not as there were no written agreement stating such expenses to be paid by the Corporate Debtor.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 634ea1de0eb98db8410fb144\n**Facts**: 1. Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No.5093 of 2008, has been filed by the Central Bank of India against the judgment and order dated 22.8.2007 passed by the Delhi High Court in Crl. M.C. No.5167 of 2003 allowing the said petition under Section 482 Cr.P.C. filed by the Respondents and discharging them and quashing the complaint filed by the Petitioner Bank and the process issued thereupon. By the said judgment, three other petitions, being Crl. M.C. No.5161 of 2003, Crl. M.C. No.5162 of 2003 and Crl. M.C. No.2166 of 2003, were also disposed of in favour of the Respondent Nos.1 and 2, M/s Asian Global Ltd. and its Director, Mr. Rajiv Jain. Several other petitions filed by Sarla Jain, a Director of the Respondent No.1 Company, also challenging the complaint filed by the Petitioner Bank and praying for discharge therefrom and quashing thereof, were allowed by the aforesaid judgment. Consequently, the Bank has also filed SLP (Crl.) Nos.5094, 5095 and 5096 of 2008, which are also being heard along with SLP(Crl.)No.5093 of 2008. 2. The facts as disclosed indicate that in 1993 the Respondent No.1 had availed of various credit facilities from the Petitioner Bank, including packing credit facility and overdraft facility. For whatever reason, the account of the Respondent No.1 is alleged to have become irregular compelling the Bank to call upon the Respondent No.1 Company to regularize its packing credit account. It appears that corporate guarantee for due repayment of the outstanding dues of the Respondent No.1 Company was given by the Respondent No.3 Company which was allegedly a sister concern of the Respondent No.1 and the Respondent No.2 while being a Director of Respondent No. 1 Company was a Joint Managing Director of the Respondent No.3 Company.  In order to discharge its liability to the Petitioner Bank, the Respondent No.3 Company issued Cheque No.255242 dated 16.5.1996, along with three other cheques, each for a sum of Rs.5 lakhs in favour of the Respondent No.1 Company which was deposited by the Respondent No.1 Company with the Petitioner Bank towards the outstanding dues of the Respondent No. 1 Company. On being presented for encashment on 16.5.1996, the said cheques were returned to the Petitioner Bank with the remarks \"funds insufficient\".  On the request made by the Respondents, the cheque was again presented for payment on 31.7.1996, but was again returned by the New Delhi Gulmohar Park Branch of the Petitioner Bank with the remark \"since account closed\". It is only thereafter that the Petitioner Bank filed a complaint against the Respondents under Sections 138 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, read with Sections 120- B and 420 I.P.C., upon which cognizance was taken by the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House, New Delhi, on 27.1.2001. Aggrieved by the order issuing summons, the Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 and other accused persons, being the Directors of the Respondent Nos.1 to 3 Companies, moved an application under Section 245(2) Cr.P.C. praying for recall of the order issuing summons and consequent discharge from the criminal proceedings initiated on the complaint filed by the Petitioner Bank on the ground that there was no privity of contract between the Petitioner Bank and the Respondent No.3, Asian Consolidated Industries Ltd. (ACIL). On the other hand, the Petitioner Bank took the stand that being a \"holder in due course\", the Bank was entitled to maintain its complaint. It is against the said order of the High Court that the present Special Leave Petitions have been filed by the Central Bank of India.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  By its order dated 28.7.2003 the Trial Court rejected the application filed by the Respondents for discharge upon holding that under Section 118(E) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, hereinafter referred to as \"the 1881 Act\", a \"holder\" of a cheque is presumed to be a \"holder in due course\" unless and until the contrary is proved by the accuse Being aggrieved by the said order dated 28.7.2003, the Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 moved the Delhi High Court under Section 482 Cr. P.C. in Crl. M.C. No. 5167 of 2003. As indicated hereinbefore, separate petitions were filed, being Crl. M.C. No.5161 of 2003, Crl. M.C. No.5162 of 2003 and Crl. M.C. No.2166 of 2003, which were heard and disposed of in favour of the Respondent Nos.1 and 2 by the learned single Judge of the Delhi High Court by discharging the respondents and quashing the complaint and the orders issuing summons.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  On behalf of the Petitioner Bank it was submitted that the High Court had misconstrued the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 141 of the 1881 Act, which merely provide that if a person committing an offence under Section 138 is a Company, every person, who at the time when the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible to the Company for the conduct of the business of the Company, as well as the Company, shall be deemed guilty of the offence. It was urged that the High Court had wrongly interpreted the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 141 of the aforesaid Act in their application to the statements made in paragraphs 12 and 21 of the complaint in arriving at a finding that the complaint had merely presumed that the Directors would be guilty because of holding a particular office since law would assume so. It was submitted that while correctly holding that to fasten liability on a Director it has to be proved that such Director was responsible to the Company and was in charge of its affairs and that such fact would have to be pleaded and proved, the High Court had erred in holding that the pleadings in paragraphs 12 and 21 of the complaint fell short of sufficient averments required to be made in a complaint under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the 1881 Act. It was submitted that the decision of this Court in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Neeta Bhalla and Anr. [(2005) 8 SCC 89] : (AIR 2005 SC 3512 : 2005 AIR SCW 4740), did not affect the Bank's case, since it had been stated in the complaint in clear and unambiguous terms that the respondents as Directors of the Company were liable for its acts and that such an allegation could be proved by leading evidence, which stage was yet to arrive when the High Court quashed the complaint and discharged the accused. It was submitted that the impugned order of the High Court was liable to be set aside and the matter was liable to be remanded to the Trial Court for being proceeded with from the stage when the complaint was quashed.  Apart from the above submissions, a further submission was made on behalf of the Bank to the effect that since the cheques which were issued in favour of the Bank had been handed over by the Respondent No.1 for collection and had been dishonoured, the Bank had become the holder of the cheques in due course and were, therefore, entitled to proceed against the Respondent No.1.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  The submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner Bank were strongly opposed on behalf of the respondents and it was submitted that having regard to the decision of this Court in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s case (AIR 2005 SC 3512 : 2005 AIR SCW 4740) (supra) which was later followed in N.K. Wahi v. Shekhar Singh and Ors. [(2007) 9 SCC 481] : (AIR 2007 SC 1454 : 2007 AIR SCW 1880), there was no scope to urge that the ingredients of a complaint against the respondents had been satisfied by the averments made in paragraphs 12 and 21 of the complaint. As far as the second limb of the submissions made on behalf of the Bank was concerned, it was submitted that the same was an argument of desperation as the cheques in question had been drawn by the Respondent No.3 on its own Bank which had dishonoured the cheques. Except for presenting the cheques to the Bank for collection, the Respondent No.1 had no other role to play in the dishonour thereof.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: We have carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties and we are unable to persuade ourselves to differ with the judgment and order of the High Court. The judgment in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s case (AIR 2005 SC 3512 : 2005 AIR SCW 4740) (supra), which was relied upon by the High Court, while interpreting the provisions of sub- section (1) of Section 141 of the 1881 Act, made it very clear that unless a specific averment was made in the complaint that at the time when the offence was committed, the person accused was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company, the requirements of Section 141 would not be satisfied. It was further held that while a Managing Director or a Joint Director of the Company would be admittedly in charge of the Company and responsible to the Company for the conduct of its business, the same yardstick would not apply to a Director. The position of a signatory to a cheque would be different in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 141 of the 1881 Act. That, of course, is not the fact in this case. 14. The law as laid down in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s case (AIR 2005 SC 3512 : 2005 AIR SCW 4740) (supra) has been consistently followed and as late as in 2007, this Court in the case of N.K. Wahi's case (AIR 2007 SC 1454 : 2007 AIR SCW 1880) (supra), while considering the question of vicarious liability of a Director of a Company, reiterated the sentiments expressed in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.'s case (supra) that merely being a Director would not make a person liable for an offence that may have been committed by the Company.  For launching a prosecution against the Directors of a Company under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the 1881 Act, there had to be a specific allegation in the complaint in regard to the part played by them in the transaction in question. It was also laid down that the allegations had to be clear and unambiguous showing that the Directors were in charge of and responsible for the business of the Company. This was done to discourage frivolous litigation and to prevent abuse of the process of Court and from embarking on a fishing expedition to try and unearth material against the Director concerned. 15. In this case, save and except for the statement that the Respondents, Mr. Rajiv Jain and Sarla Jain and some of the other accused, were Directors of the accused Companies and were responsible and liable for the acts of the said Companies, no specific allegation has been made against any of them. The question of proving a fact which had not been mentioned in the complaint did not, therefore, arise in the facts of this case. This has prompted the High Court to observe that the Bank had relied on the mistaken presumption that as Directors, Rajiv Jain, Sarla Jain and the other Directors were vicariously liable for the acts of the Company.  Admittedly, except for the aforesaid statement, no other material has been disclosed in the complaint to make out a case against the respondents that they had been in charge of the affairs of the Company and were responsible for its action.  The High Court, therefore, rightly held that in the absence of any specific charge against the Respondents, the complaint was liable to be quashed and the respondents were liable to be discharged.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "Certainly, here's a summary:\n    The appellant, a corporate debtor, challenged the order of the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai (Adjudicating Authority) initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against it.\nThe Adjudicating Authority after considering the facts and circumstances of the case in entirety and having regard to the provisions of section 9 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (I&B Code) came to the conclusion that the appellant has committed default in payment of the operational debt.\nHence, the appeal filed by the appellant.\nDismissing the appeal, the Court, HELD: 1. The appellant has failed to discharge the onus cast upon it u/s 12 of the I&B Code. The Adjudicating Authority has rightly held that the unpaid operational debt has not been admittedly paid. Also, claim of the Operational Creditor to the extent of Rs. 8,68,478/- raised in the Company Petition before the Adjudicating Authority is ex-facie barred by limitation since the Operational Creditor has admitted that the dates of default of the said amount are prior to three years preceding the date of institution of Company Petition i.e. on 24th June, 2019. The Adjudicating Authority has rightly held that the out of pocket expenses actually incurred by the Operational Creditor is mentioned in the invoices under the heading non-receipt charges, hence there could not be any other amount towards out of pocket expenses that is payable by the Corporate Debtor. The onus of proving that the amount of Rs. 14,17,000/- paid by the Corporate Debtor to the employees of the Operational Creditor was towards out of pocket expenses was totally on the Operational CREDITOR. The Adjudicating Authority has rightly held that the OperATIONAL CREDITOR has failed to adduce any evidence to prove that the amount of Rs. 14,17,000/- paid by the Corporate DEBTOR to the employees of the OperATIONAL CREDITOR was towards out of pocket expenses. [27E F] 2. The Adjudicating Authority has considered the facts and circumstances of the case in entirety and has rightly come to the conclusion that the Corporate DEBTOR has committed default in payment of the operational debt.

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nPrayer in this petition is for grant of anticipatory bail to the petitioners in FIR No.151 dated 18.06.2020 registered under Sections 420, 465, 467, 468, 471, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short 'IPC') at Police Station City Batala, District Batala.  The complainant has filed his counter-affidavit along with the documents and advance copy to learned senior counsel for the petitioners.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has argued that in fact, the petitioners and the complainant, previously were having business dealings and on an earlier occasion, the petitioner lodged an FIR No.168 dated 29.08.2017 under Sections 420, 406, 34 IPC, Police Station Civil Lines, Batala, was registered against Jaswinder Kaur and Surinder Pal Singh, therefore, there was no occasion for the petitioners to deal on their behalf. I It is further submitted that even subsequently, another FIR No.127 dated 21.08.2019 under Sections 420, 406, 34 IPC, Police Station City Batala, District Batala, was also registered against the aforesaid two persons i.e. Jaswinder Kaur and Surinder Pal Singh.  Learned senior counsel has also submitted that even the complainant has filed complaints under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter to be referred as 'the N.I. Act'), against Jaswinder Kaur and Surinder Pal Singh, which are pending before the Court at Batala and therefore, the petitioners never dealt on their behalf with the complainant.  It is further argued that in fact, the dispute between the complainant and his mother arose with the petitioners, on account of a registered General Power of Attorney (GPA) dated 22.06.2017, in furtherance of which the petitioner No.1 has entered into an agreement to sell on 04.12.2019 with one Damandeep Singh and Barinder Pal Singh on behalf of the complainant. It is also submitted that even on that account, Damandeep Singh and Barinder Pal Singh have filed a civil suit for permanent injunction against the complainant, his mother and petitioner No.1 on 03.05.2020 and the same is pending before the Civil Judge (Jr. Division), Batala. It is further argued that in fact, it is the complainant, who owe an amount of Rs. 26 lacs to petitioner No.1 and in this regard, on dishonouring of a cheque issued by the complainant and his mother, the petitioner No.1 has filed a complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act on 13.05.2020, which is also pending before the Court at Batala. . Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has also submitted that in fact, the present FIR was registered regarding the purchase of some jewelleries on behalf of the aforesaid two persons and later on, by way of two Rapat/DDR Nos.49 and 50 dated 19.06.2020, the police has amended the FIR without there being any such provision to transpose new facts in the FIR as the FIR denotes the First Information Report recorded by the police and the police, during the investigation of the allegation in the FIR, can add any offence, relating to that particular incident but cannot add new incidents by recording DDRs as is done in the present case. . Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further argued that the police, well within its powers, could have registered another FIR with regard to the offences having different date and incidents but no such amendment in the FIR is permissible in law. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has also submitted that it is own case of the complainant, as per the DDRs that when the agreement to sell was executed by the complainant in favour of petitioner No.1, a GPA was also registered. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has referred to the contents of the agreement dated 22.06.2017, which was entered into between the complainant - Sumit Kumar, his mother Usha Rani with Bhawna Khosla through her brother-in-law i.e. petitioner No.1 Sohit Khosla and signed by petitioner No.2 - Surinder Khosla as a witness. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has referred to a Clause of the agreement wherein it is recorded as under:-\\n\\n\"In respect of the 2/3rd share in the aforesaid shop, we have executed a General Power of Attorney in favour of Sohit Khosla and agreement has been executed in the name of Bhavna Khosla as the amount has been paid by Bhavna Khosla. The aforementioned General Power of Attorney shall not be cancelled without taking Bhavna Khosla and Sohit Khosla into confidence. This agreement is therefore written on this date 22.06.2017.\" . Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has, thus, argued that it was agreed between the parties that the GPA is part and parcel of the agreement to sell and cannot be cancelled without the consent of Bhawna Khosla and petitioner No.1 - Sohit Khosla. 2. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further referred to the enquiry conducted by the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Batala, that the petitioners, in order to grab the property of Sumit Kumar, have entered into an agreement dated 04.12.2019 with Damandeep Singh and Barinder Pal Singh and they have received an amount of Rs. 10 lacs as earnest money and thus, have committed the fraud. 13. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has also argued that the complainant has made improvements in their versions while recording the two DDRs, which are not pleaded either in the civil suit for permanent injunction or in the complaints under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. It is further submitted that the matter is already pending before the various Courts and is of civil nature and just to put pressure on the petitioners, the present FIR has been registered to give it a colour of criminal litigation. 14. Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has further submitted that he has the instructions to say that the petitioners are ready to deposit the amount of Rs. 10 lacs with the trial Court/Illaqa Magistrate, subject to final outcome of the case, to be kept in an FDR.  In reply, learned senior counsel for the petitioners has again reiterated the argument that in none of the civil suit filed and relied upon by the complainant, the factum of cheating as alleged in the present FIR is mentioned and further argued that it is own case of the complainant that there are business transactions qua which both the parties are demanding money against each other.  Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has stated that the dispute regarding agreement to sell and receiving of Rs. 10 lacs is admitted by the petitioners and petitioner No.1 is ready to deposit the said amount in the trial Court/Illaqa Magistrate, subject to final outcome of the case, to show his bona fide. It is also stated that with regard to the other claims inter se complainant and the accused, are primarily of civil nature as it is admitted case of the complainant that they had business transactions with the petitioners and have already filed suit for recovery.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n15. In reply, counsel for the State assisted by counsel for the complainant has opposed the prayer for bail on the ground that the complainant has given the first application dated 21.02.2020 regarding the cheating of Rs. 51.76 lacs and on account of gold transactions on behalf of the aforesaid two persons i.e. Jaswinder Kaur and Surinder Pal Singh. It is further submitted that the second complaint was given on 25.05.2020, regarding fabrication of some false GST bills, by showing sale of fake goods on credit basis. It is also submitted that the petitioners in February, 2020, tried to involve the complainant in a false case under Section 307 IPC and his complaint was found to be false by the police on seeing the recordings of the CCTV camera. It is further argued that another application was given on 05.06.2020, for which the FIR was registered on account of fabricating an agreement in favour of Damandeep Singh and Barinder Pal Singh, who are business partners of the petitioners. Counsel for the complainant has further argued that the complainant and his father had agreed to sell the property to Bhawna Khosla as per the agreement dated 22.06.2017 and has also given a power of attorney in favour of Sohit Khosla. It is stated that the amount of Rs. 1 crore paid by the petitioners was credited in the account of Usha Rani, mother of the complainant, however, later on in December, 2017, the agreement to sell was cancelled and Bhawna Khosla received Rs. 50 lacs through HDFC bank and another amount of Rs. 50 lacs from Usha Rani on 20.12.2017 through HDFC bank. It is also stated that once the agreement was cancelled, there was no occasion for petitioner No.1 to act upon, on behalf of the petitioner as per G.P.A. while entering into agreement to sell in favour of Damandeep Singh and Barinder Pal Singh. Counsel for the complainant has further argued that in fact, the fraud has been played with the complainant as the petitioner No.1 tried to sell the property on the basis of the GPA, which was later on cancelled, on throw away prices and received Rs. 10 lacs as earnest money. It is further submitted that the agreement to sell dated 04.12.2019 in favour of Damandeep Singh and Barinder Pal Singh is an anti-dated and fabricated agreement. It is also submitted that in fact, petitioner No.2 - Surinder Khosla has appeared as a witness in FIR No.5 dated 10.01.2020 under Section 302 IPC at Police Station Chatiwind, Amritsar, wherein the son and wife of Barinder Pal Singh, are accused.  Counsel for the complainant has also submitted that in fact, a suit for recovery and mandatory injunction was also filed by M/s. Kartike Gold Enterprises in which the complainant is a partner before the Commercial Court at Gurdaspur on 13.02.2020 against petitioner No.2 and his firm M/s. Shree Ganesh Enterprises regarding a cheque of Rs. 26 lacs and another suit for recovery is filed on the basis of the sale of gold and the payments due against petitioner No.1.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n On 29.06.2020, the following order was passed:-\\n\\n\"Heard through video conferencing.\\n\\nIt has been contended by learned counsel for the petitioners that there is a total mismatch as regards the contents of the FIR and the investigation which has been carried out on the basis of the FIR. It has further been contended that though the FIR talks about the purchase of jewellery by the petitioners on behalf of a third person and giving a cheque to the complainant on behalf of that third person, the investigation talks of a wholly different issue that is regarding the issuance of power of attorney in favour of the petitioners by the complainant.\\n\\nNotice of motion.\\n\\nOn the asking of the court, Ms. Bhavna Gupta, DAG, Punjab has joined the session through video conferencing and accepts notice on behalf of the State. Mr. Gaurav Chopra, Advocate, has also put in appearance and accepted notice on behalf of the complainant. He has submitted that on 19.06.2020 there was an amendment in the FIR by way of two Rapat Nos.49 and 50 and these Rapats were physically handed over to the Reader of the Court while the matter was being heard through video conferencing. However, in the order dated 20.06.2020 the same has inadvertently not been noticed due to the fact that the documents which were given to the Reader of the Court were not brought to the notice of the Court at the time of deciding the application. Same contentions have been reiterated by the learned counsel for the State.\\n\\nAdjourned to 02.07.2020.\\n\\nReply, if any, be filed on or before the next date of hearing.\"\n",
    "Case_Result": "16. It is not disputed by the complainant that the contents of the application dated 21.02.2020 as per the enquiry, were recorded in the present FIR and the police, thereafter, rectified the contents of F.I.R by recording two DDR Nos.49 and 50 dated 19.06.2020.21. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, I find merit in the present petition.22. Admittedly, the FIR was registered with allegation of cheating with the complainant regarding the sale of gold by the complainant and his mother Usha Rani with the firm M/s. Kartike Gold Enterprises owned by petitioner No.1. Later on, by registering two DDR Nos.49 and 50 dated 19.06.2020, certain new facts on the basis of the complaints given by the petitioners were added in the present FIR, a procedure which is unknown to the criminal law. It is also a matter of record that various litigations are pending between the parties before the Civil Court as well as before the Criminal Court where the complaints under the N.I. Act are pending. In two civil suits filed by the complainant, which were filed after giving the complaints to the police forming basis of the FIR/two DDRs, no such allegation of fraud regarding agreement to sell is mentioned and it appears that the FIR has been registered just to put pressure on the petitioners. Order accordingly",

State of Maharashtra Cr. Appeal No. 2287 of 2009, 2014 (3) Law Herald 2697 (SC) in as much as the impugned cheque was drawn on the Bank of India, Basant Lok, New Delhi located outside the jurisdiction of South East District, Delhi and as the proceedings of the present complaint have not yet reached the stage of Section 145(2) of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as the recording of evidence had not commenced, it was observed that the learned Trial Court lacks territorial jurisdiction over the present matter and thus the complaint was ordered to be returned to the complainant along with the affidavit by way of evidence and other original documents observing to the effect that the learned Trial Court did not have territorial jurisdiction over the matter, the petitioner seeks restoration of the same to its original stage and that the delay, if any, for filing the application for restoration / revival before the learned MM concerned be condoned.  The notice was issued to the respondents with respondent no. 1 arrayed on record being the State. The proceedings against the respondent no. 5 Mr. Ram Laljharia, Director of the respondent no. 1 company i.e. M/s. Yograj Infrastructure Ltd. have already been dismissed as withdrawn on 29.11.2017 in view of the submissions made on behalf of the petitioner. The written submissions on behalf of the petitioner and on behalf of the respondents no. 2 to 5 had already been submitted before withdrawal of the case against the respondent no.5, are on record. Oral arguments were addressed on behalf of either side.\\n\\n5. The averments put forth through the complaint in question instituted on 29.09.2012 by the petitioner herein were to the effect that the petitioner is a limited company, which was engaged in the business of manufacturing, sale of machines pertaining to construction and earthmoving under the brand name of LiuGong and which company also provides product support services qua the said machines; that the accused persons arrayed therein as the respondents no. 2 to 4 (and arrayed to the present petition initially as the respondents no. 2 to 5) are stated to have placed orders for supply of machines with the complainant company i.e. the petitioner for supply of the same at the desired destination as per requirement from time to time and towards payments of outstanding dues stated against the material supplied to them and cheque bearing no. 015292 dated 30.01.2012 and cheque bearing no. 015293 dated 20.02.2012, i.e. two cheques both amounting to Rs. 25,00,000/- each drawn on the Bank of Baroda, Basant Lok, New Delhi in favour of the complainant's company signed by the accused no. 2 i.e. the respondent no. 3 herein on behalf of the accused no. 1 i.e. the respondent no. 2 herein were issued to the petitioner. The cheques as per the complaint were stated to have been signed by accused no.2 with the consent, connivance and knowledge of all other accused directors of the respondent no. 2 herein to the complainant in favour of the complainant company which when deposited by the complainant in its bank account maintained with the HDFC Bank Ltd., Kalkaji, New Delhi for encashment were returned unpaid by the banker for insufficient funds vide Instrument Advices 28.07.2012 and 16.08.2012 with the remarks \"INSUFFICIENT FUNDS\". The cheques instrument advices along with cheques in original were received by the complainant on 30.07.2012 and 21.08.2012 and had been filed with the complaint. After issuance of the notice dated 23.08.2012 to the accused calling upon the accused for payment of dishonoured cheques, when the payment was not made within 15 days of the receipt of the notice, the complaint was filed under Section 138 read with Section 141 and 142 of the The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on 27.09.2012. Vide The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015 dated 15.06.2015, which came into force at once, Section 142(2) was inserted to The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and Section 142A was also inserted. On 22.09.2015, The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015 was promulgated and vide order dated 15.06.2015, the amendments to Section 142 of The Negotiable Instruments Act and the insertion of Section 142A to The Negotiable Instruments Act was made, which read as under : Thus in terms of the amendment to The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, jurisdiction in relation to an offence punishable under Section 138 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 lay only with the branch of the bank where the payee of the holder in due course maintained his / its account which in the instant case was the HDFC Bank Ltd., Kalkaji, New Delhi i.e. the bank of the petitioner herein i.e. the complainant of the CC no. 157/1/12 and thus the jurisdiction lay with the Court having jurisdiction over the area of Kalkaji i.e. South Eash District, New Delhi on the date when the application seeking revival / restoration of the complaint, was taken up on 08.10.2015.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: Vide the order dated 14.05.2015 in view of the verdict of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod (Supra), it was observed by the learned Trial court that the impugned cheque was drawn upon and dishonoured by the Bank of India, Basant Lok, New Delhi located outside the jurisdiction of the South East District, Delhi and that the proceedings of that complaint had not till then reached the stage of Section 145(2) of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and that the recording of the evidence had not commenced and it was held that due to lack of territorial jurisdiction over the matter, the complaint was thus ordered to be returned to the complainant along with the affidavit by way of evidence and other original documents and the complainant was directed to file the certified photocopies of the complaint and aforesaid documents with the Ahlmad of the Court before receiving the originals thereof. Further it was directed vide order dated 14.05.2017 that the complainant was at liberty to file the complaint afresh before the Court of competent jurisdiction as per the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod (Supra).\n**Argument by Petitioner**: The petitioner has submitted further that the complainant i.e. the petitioner herein was thus to file the complaint before the concerned Court within a period of 30 days after the order dated 14.05.2015 of the learned MM concerned but the District Courts were closed on 09.06.2015 for the summer vacation and in the meanwhile the Government of India through the President of India, promulgated  and it was thus submitted on behalf of the petitioner that in terms of Section 142A(1) of the The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or any judgment, decree order or directions of any Court, all cases arising out of the Section 138 which were pending in any Court whether filed before it or transferred to it before the commencement of The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015 were to be transferred to the Court having jurisdiction under Sub-Section (2) of Section 142 as if that sub-section had been in force at all material times. It has been submitted on behalf of the petitioner to the effect that the Government of India through the President of India re-promulgated the Ordinance on 22.09.2015 which was deemed to come into force on 15.06.2015 and thus in view of the said Ordinance which was made effective on 15.06.2015 by virtue of the deeming provisions of the Ordinance, the petitioner herein moved an application before the learned MM, Saket Courts, New Delhi for revival / restoration of the complaint under Section 138 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on 29.09.2015, which was dismissed on 08.10.2015 observing to the effect that the complaint had been returned on 14.05.2015 and having been sent to the Record Room, the Court of the learned MM did not have power to revive and restore the complaint. Admittedly the cheques in question are issued by the accused drawn on the Bank of Baroda, Basant Lok, New Delhi and thus did not fall within the jurisdiction of the South East District, Saket on the date when the complaint was returned on 14.05.2015. Thus as on the date 14.05.2015, the order of return of the complaint, the Court of learned MM, South East District, Delhi did not have jurisdiction over the cause of action which in terms of the verdict of the Hon'ble Apex Court was within the jurisdiction of the Court where the cheques had been dishonoured, and the cheqeus in the instant case were dishonoured by the Bank of Baroda, Basant Lok, New Delhi though mentioned to have been dishonoured by the Bank of India, Basant Lok, New Delhi. The submissions of the petitioner are to the effect that he could not avail his remedies till 14.06.2015 in as much as the Courts were closed from 09.06.2015 for the summer vacation and the certified photocopies of the complaint and aforesaid documents have not been received till 29.09.2015. It has thus been submitted on behalf of the petitioner that in view of the amendments made in The Negotiable Instruments Act, which are retrospectively made applicable in terms of Section 142A(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the petition be restored to its original number and original stage.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  On behalf of the respondents no. 2 to 4, the petition has been vehemently opposed submitting to the effect that the amendments made in The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 do not have retrospective application and that the petitioner did not choose to comply with the order dated 14.05.2015 within the stipulated period of one month of filing of the complaint afresh in the Court having jurisdiction over Basant Lok, New Delhi and thereafter filed the application seeking restoration /revival of the petition in view of the amendments to under Section 142 and to Section 142A of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which it was contended were not retrospectively applicable. Inter alia it was submitted on behalf of the respondents no. 2 to 4 that the delay in re-filing the complaint on 08.10.2015 had not been explained in as much as the complaint had not been filed afresh till 29.09.2015 and it was further submitted on behalf of the respondents that the complaint in any event had not been re-filed within a period of 30 days and thus there was no infirmity in the impugned order. It has also been submitted on behalf of the respondents that there is no explanation put forth by the petitioner for the delay in submission of the application seeking revival of the petition. Through the written submissions that have been submitted on behalf of the respondents inter alia it was submitted that the ordinance dated 15.06.2015 does not have retrospective effect and does not effect the position of law as detailed vide order dated 14.05.2015.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  At the outset, it is essential to observe that the amendments made in The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 vide the ordinance dated 15.06.2015 are retrospectively applicable as in terms of The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015 dated 15.06.2015 which was re-promulgated on 22.09.2015 and brought into The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015 with retrospective application and Section 142A brought into play by the said amendment dated 15.06.2015 subsequently laid down that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or judgment, decree, order or direction of any Court, all cases transferred to the Court having jurisdiction vide sub-section (2) of Section 142 of the amendment Act as amended vide The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Ordinance, 2015 would be deemed to have been transferred under the Act as if that sub-section had been in force all material times.  and thus the ratio of the verdict of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Bridgstone Industry Pvt. Ltd (Supra) makes it thus abundantly clear that in the instant case the jurisdiction lay only with the branch of the bank where the payee or holder in due course maintained his / its account, and the Court there alone would have jurisdiction, qua the complaint for an offence punishable under Section 138 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 which can be inquired into or tried and thus in the instant case as the bank of payee i.e. the complainant is the HDFC Bank Ltd., situated at Kalkaji, New Delhi, the Court having jurisdiction to try the offences punishable under Section 138 of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is situated in the area of the South East District, Delhi. The submissions made thus on behalf of the respondents no. 2 to 4 qua the aspect of non-retrospective applicability of the amended provision of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 cannot be accepted in view of the verdict of this Court in Pankaj Garg (Supra) and in view of the verdict of the Hon'ble Apex Court in case titled as Bridgstone India Pvt. Ltd. (Supra). Thus in view of the retrospective applicability of the provisions of Section 142(2) of The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in view of the The Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2015, the delay in filing the application for restoration / revival before the MM concerned in the South East District, Delhi is condoned to avoid failure of justice. The verdict of this Court in the case titled as Pankaj Garg Vs. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) & Anr. dated 13.10.2015 in Crl. M.C. 4239/2015 is to the similar effect and it is also significant that in this case the condonation of delay by the revisional Court for taking up the matter by the Court which has jurisdiction to continue with the proceedings in terms of the amended Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, was condoned. Reliance was also placed on behalf of the petitioner on the verdict of the Hon'ble Divison Bench of the Kerala High Court in case titled as Binoy K. Mathew Vs. Godley Dev Joh, 2015(4) Civil Court Cases 016 (Kerala (DB) whereby also it was directed that the complaints were allowed to be presented in the respective Courts where they were originally filed in view of the amendment.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe core issue in this case revolves around the lower court's decision to deny anticipatory bail to the petitioners in FIR No. 151/2020 registered under Sections 420, 465, 467, 468, 471, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short 'IPC') at Police Station City Batala, District Batala. The petitioners argue that they have no occasion to deal with the complainant and that the disputes between them are primarily of civil nature. On the other hand, the complainant alleges that the petitioners have committed fraud and cheating by selling his property on the basis of a General Power of Attorney (GPA) that was later cancelled.\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the arguments presented by both parties, it is apparent that the lower court's decision to dismiss the petitioners' anticipatory bail request is not supported by the evidence and applicable laws. The Indian Negotiable Instruments Act does not have any provision to transpose new facts in the FIR as amended by the police. The police, well within its powers, could have registered another FIR with regard to the offences having different date and incidents but no such amendment in the FIR is permissible in law.\n\nFurthermore, the complainant's own case, as per the DDRs, makes improvements in their versions while recording the two DDRs, which are not pleaded either in the civil suit for permanent injunction or in the complaints under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. The matter is already pending before the various courts and is of civil nature. Just to put pressure on the petitioners, the present FIR has been registered to give it a colour of criminal litigation.\n\nConsidering these facts, it is clear that the lower court's judgment is not well-reasoned and in direct contradiction to the applicable laws. Therefore, the appeal should be allowed, and the petitioners granted anticipatory bail."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThis application has been filed seeking leave to file appeal against the judgment of acquittal dated 24.12.2014 passed by the lower appellate Court, vide which, while acquitting the respondents-accused, the judgment of conviction and order of sentence of even date i.e. 20.03.2013 passed by the trial Court, were set aside.  Brief facts of the case are that the applicant-complainant had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'N.I. Act') against the respondents-accused with the allegations that a cheque dated 30.03.2001 amounting to Rs. 11.00 lacs, on presentation before the bank, was dishonoured. It is further stated in the complaint that the complainant has supplied HR Coils to accused No.1-Company through various invoices Ex.C1 to Ex.C13 and in partial discharge of the liability, accused No.2 issued a cheque in question Ex.C3 under his signatures on behalf of accused No.1-Company.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n6. Learned counsel for the applicant has argued that the lower appellate Court has, in fact, reversed the findings recorded by the trial Court without assigning good reasons. It is further argued that accused No.2, being Director of accused No.1-Company, is vicariously liable, when accused No.1-Company is held liable for the offence. It is also argued that the lower appellate Court has wrongly held that the memo Ex.C5, vide which the cheque was returned, is not admissible, as no permission to lead secondary evidence was obtained and even record of the complainant Ex.C4 to Ex.C17, being photocopies, is not admissible.  It is next argued that the lower appellate Court has wrongly observed that address given in the legal notice was not correct and was incomplete, whereas there is a presumption attached to the notice issued through registered A.D. Post.  Learned counsel for the applicant has further argued that the lower appellate Court has observed that the complaint was not filed by the authorized person, whereas CW1 Ashok Kumar was duly authorized by the applicant-Corporation to appear on its behalf and therefore, findings recorded by the lower appellate are incorrect. The lower appellate Court has further wrongly held that the cheque, in fact, was given as security and was not meant to discharge any liability.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n8. In reply, learned senior counsel for the respondents has argued that the complaint itself is not maintainable, as accused No.1-Company was impleaded through the Managing Director and nobody was named as Managing Director and therefore, no person on behalf of accused No.1-Company could be convicted, as nobody is named as Managing Director. It is further argued that there is no evidence on record to show that accused No.2-Director was responsible for day to day business of accused No.1-Company.  In support of his arguments, learned senior counsel has relied upon a judgment in Aneeta Hada Vs. M/s Godfather Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd., 2012 (2) RCR (Criminal) 854 to submit that it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that where the complainant failed to prove that accused, who has been arrayed as Director of the Company, is not responsible for day to day functioning of the Company and he cannot be held guilty. 9. Learned senior counsel for the respondents has further argued that the documents Ex.C4 to Ex.C17 are photocopies and therefore, they are not admissible in evidence, as originals thereof were not produced on record. It is further argued that even the notice Ex.C6 itself is defective, as it is not mentioned that accused No.1-Company is served through an individual as it is only mentioned 'through its Managing Director'. It is also submitted that even the address given in the notice is incomplete and there is no presumption that the notice was ever served. In this regard, learned senior counsel has relied upon M/s Kumar Exports Vs. M/s Sharma Carpets, 2009 (1) RCR (Criminal) 478, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that where the complainant has not produced the books of account or stock register maintained by him in the course of his regular business, complaint is liable to fail and the accused was acquitted.   Learned senior counsel for the respondents has next argued that the complainant has failed to prove on record the authorization in his favour by the Board of Directors of the applicant-Corporation and no such documents has been exhibited on record to show that CW1 Ashok Kumar, who appeared on behalf of the complainant, was authorized person.  Learned senior counsel for the respondents has also argued that in the cross-examination of CW1 Ashok Kumar, it has come that there is no resolution in favour of Sanjeev Bawa, who filed the complaint and he could not produce on record any resolution passed by the Board of Directors in favour of Sanjeev Bawa to authorize Ashok Kumar to depose in the case. . Learned senior counsel has lastly relied upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in A.C. Narayanan Vs. State of Maharashtra and another, 2015 (1) Crimes 116 to submit that where a complaint is filed by Power of Attorney of a Company, but the evidence is given by an employee of the Company, without being empowered to file the complaint, the order of acquittal passed by the Court below, is liable to be upheld. . It is further submitted that without following the procedure as per Section 65 of Evidence Act, the photocopies of the documents, without production of originals thereof, mere exhibition of the documents, will not dispense with the mode of proof.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe trial Court, vide its judgment of conviction dated 20.03.2013, held the respondents guilty of offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act and vide order of sentence of even date i.e. 20.03.2013, sentenced accused No.2 to undergo R.I. for a period of two years and to pay a compensation to the tune of Rs. 22.00 lacs to the complainant. Thereafter, the respondents filed an appeal before the lower appellate Court and while reversing the judgment of conviction passed by the trial Court, the lower appellate Court allowed the appeal. The operative part of the judgment passed by the lower appellate Court reads as under: - \"First of all argument has been advanced from both the sides and findings have also been returned by learned trial Court on the ground of non joinder of Managing Director of company. The trial Court has given the finding that Managing Director was not arrayed and summoned as an accused in his individual capacity but only to represent the accused No.1 and same has been represented by accused No.2 Gurinder Singh. The trial Court has further given finding on this point that \"accused No.2 has neither disputed the fact that cheque in question was issued under his signatures nor has disputed the fact that he was no more a director of the company, thus, to my mind he has also been representing the accused No.1 company. After considering this finding, this Court is of view that it is also supposition and such finding by trial Court is not based on any material on record. Nowhere it is established from the evidence as led by complainant that appellant is in any way acting as Managing Director of the company-respondent No.1 before trial Court. In this regard the authority is relied upon by learned counsel for appellant cited as 2012 (2) RCR (Criminal) 854 titled Aneeta Hada vs. M/s Godfather Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd. wherein it is held by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that prosecution of director of company without arraying the company as accused and in such situation the proceedings have been quashed by holding that Directors could not be executed without company being arrayed as an accused. In the case in hand although company-respondent No.1 has been impleaded as accused but during the proceedings of this case company has never been summoned through MD nor service has been effected through MD. The Court itself has conceded one Gurvinder Singh, Director to represent the company. Once the accused No.1 has never been served nor any notice of accusation has been given by the Court to the said company nor such notice of accusation has been given to appellant to represent the company then it is strange enough that how trial Court has returned the findings itself by holding that accused No.2 hereby appellant represent company accused No.1. These findings are against the spirit of settled principles of law by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India authority. So, such findings are not sustainable. The director of company is only vicariously liable when company is held criminally liable. On the next point of cheque returning memo Exhibit C5, it has been vigorously argued by counsel for appellant that photo copy cannot be admitted in evidence by Court being not even secondary evidence and mere exhibition does not dispense with its proof. Exhibit C5 is photo copy. The trial Court has returned the findings that at the time of its exhibition accused has not objected and if such objection would have been there the complainant would have got the opportunity to remove the same by producing the original or by examining the bank official. This is not duty of accused to point out what document has to be proved by complainant. It is rather duty of Court to see if such evidence as produced on record and photo copy of document is exhibited without producing original of the same, that whether it is admissible or not. In the evidence CW.1 Ashok Kumar who has produced all these documents including photo copy of memo Exhibit C5. Perusal of trial Court file shows that there are two memos of the bank regarding dishonouring of cheque one is dated 7.4.2001 and it is produced in original, Exhibit C5 is photo copy and there are many cuttings on it. Witness of complainant has admitted in cross-examination that original of Exhibit C5 is not on record in both the complaints. He has also admitted that as per Exhibit C5 the reason of dishonouring is that \"signatures are incomplete as second signatory was required to sign\". This document is very crucial document. The serious doubt has been there put by accused side that this cheque was not dishonoured due to \"funds insufficient\" but it was due to reason that \"drawer's signatures incomplete as second signatures was required\". So, ignoring this fact by learned trial Court is not logical and learned trial Court has simply rejected this contention by returning the finding that it hardly matters as both the reasons are within the powers of accused. In considered view of this Court, the learned trial Court has given wrong interpretation of law and such finding has been returned by the Court without any material on record in this context. In the criminal jurisprudence it is always that the prosecution or complainant side which has to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. No such evidence has been brought on record by complainant regarding the fact that any such memo in original is existing on the record nor any permission has been taken to prove it by way of secondary evidence. Photo copy of this memo is not secondary evidence. Moreover, when serious doubt is there on the basis of cuttings on it that whether dishonour was due to insufficient funds or due to incomplete signatures. In this regard law has been relied upon by learned counsel for appellant in case Smt. J. Yashoda vs. Smt. K. Shobha Rani 2007(2) RCR (Civil) 840 Supreme Court wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has settled the law that photo copies of original cannot be received as secondary evidence in terms of Section 63 of Evidence Act. It is also settled that so long as higher or superior evidence is in possession of a party that party shall not give any inferior proof in relation to it. The law settled by Hon'ble Supreme Court is fully applicable to present case. Further law has been cited by learned counsel for appellant titled Vinod Tanna vs. Zaheer Siddiqui 2002(1) RCR (Criminal) 622 Supreme Court wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid down the law that if cheque is dishonoured as signatures on the cheque were incomplete then no offence is made out under Section 138. So, in considered view of this Court, the trial Court has not properly interpreted this law although cited the same. So, such findings are not sustainable and is reversed. The next point of contention is regarding mistake in the name of accused No.2. The cheque in question is proved on record as Exhibit C3 allegedly signed by Gurinder Singh appellant. No such record has been produced on record by complainant that any Gurvinder Singh is Director. Legal notice Exhibit C6 is proved on record which is sent to Gurvinder Singh through registered AD post as well as UPC. No evidence has been brought on record by complainant that Gurvinder Singh and Gurinder Singh are one and the same persons. While returning findings the learned trial Court has pre-judged this point as at the very start of returning findings Court has returned the finding that this objection is also not sustainable as Courts are for the purpose of doing effective justice considering the merits of case and not to cause its miscarriage by going into technicalities. There is no such pleadings nor evidence but Court has given findings on its own to the respect that it is only human error and it is mere clerical/typographical mistake in writing name as Gurvinder Singh instead of Gurinder Singh. Again there is no pleading by the complainant nor evidence that such mistake was not done intentionally. The Court again at its own has returned the findings that there was no such intentional act in committing such mistake. Rather Court has given the findings that it was accused who has to give evidence to make it clear. Again these findings are against criminal jurisprudence as it is not accused who has to make clear case of the prosecution and negative evidence has not to be led by accused. The Court at its own has gone through report of service constable on the warrants issued for 22.11.2002 where he has reported that wife of Gurvinder Singh was present and she intimated that her husband has gone to Ludhiana. The Court has taken judicial notice of such report of Constable which is absolutely not per se admissible nor such report has been authenticated by independent witness. Even such evidence has not been led by complainant. The Court has returned such findings on the basis of such report by Constable which is not permissible under the law. The learned trial Court has further returned the findings on the point that when accused admits his signatures on the cheque and he has failed to convince the Court that he has been prejudiced due to wrong mentioning of his name and objection has been turned down by the trial Court. In considered view of this Court, again it is mere supposition by the trial Court and this authority by Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana cited as V.K. Gupta vs. Manjit Kaur 2008(3) RCR (Criminal) 430 P&H is wrongly made applicable to the facts of this case. This judgment is also relied upon by counsel for appellant. In this authority the Hon'ble High Court has given the finding that trial Court has no power to allow correction in the complaint. As per the facts of this case before Hon'ble High Court, complainant erroneously mentioned the date of presentation of cheque and date of dishonour of the same and the Hon'ble High Court has given the finding that in such situation complainant has to suffer for defects and Magistrate has no power to return the complaint for removing the defects. So, in considered view of this Court, the learned trial Court has wrongly interpreted the law settled by Hon'ble High Court. As such, finding on this point by learned trial Court is also not sustainable. Another point has been argued regarding service of legal notice and admissibility of postal receipts. The trial Court has returned the finding that accused has not disputed the fact that complete address reflected in the legal notice was not correct or same was incomplete. The trial Court has given findings that on postal receipt only house number of accused has not been mentioned, it cannot be said that same is fatal to case of complainant. There is no case of complainant that postal department mentions address in this way but Court has drawn such inference on the basis of postal receipt. The learned trial Court has further given the finding that even in case registered cover has been sent to incomplete address, the accused would have been served through the notice sent by ordinary post. It is again strange to this Court that as per law under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act a legal notice has to be served mandatorily through registered AD post. The trial Court has given contradictory findings as on the one hand it has stated that due to incomplete address registered cover has not been served and it is not presumed under law that ordinary post is surely delivered to the addressee. The learned trial Court has gone to this extent of returning the finding that even in case the Court comes to the conclusion that no notice has been received by accused, in that case also no benefit can be given to him in view of settled law by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as C.C. Alavi Haji vs. Palapetty Muhammad unreported judgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is again wrong application of the law as it is legal and valuable right of accused as enshrined in legislation to receive legal notice upon dishonouring of cheque and giving chance to the accused to make payment. In the given facts and circumstances of the case it is very much needed that complainant has to prove on record that accused has been well served regarding dishonouring of cheque and liability was pointed out in the cheque. The learned trial Court in this regard has further returned the finding to the respect that \"the purpose of service of legal notice is to intimate the bonafide drawer that his cheque has been dishonoured and he can avoid prosecution by making payment but in case drawer wants to dispute his liability, then hardly makes any difference that whether he had received the legal notice or not\". Again there is no such pleading by complainant nor any evidence and this Court has drawn the conclusion that it is against the basic provisions of law and also settled law. In considered view of this Court, such findings are also not sustainable. Next point of contention as raised by counsel for appellant is that Senior Officer R.K. Goyal is not competent to file the complaint nor unauthorized person can depose as a witness when complainant company is a registered company under the Companies Act. The law has been settled that company do the work as per resolutions and any person acting on behalf of company shall be duly authorized. No such resolution has been proved on record that complaint has been filed by authorized person or Ashok Kumar who appeared as CW.1 on behalf of company is also authorized to depose. In the evidence when CW.1 Ashok Kumar has been confronted with this situation he could not explain regarding any authority to him to depose or regarding any authority to earlier Law Officer R.K. Goyal to file complaint. He has admitted in cross-examination that Board of Directors of complainant corporation has not given him any authority by way of resolution to depose in this case rather he has further stated that the person who has given him authority has been authorized by the Board of Directors. He has further admitted that there is no mention of resolution passed by Board of Directors in favour of Sanjeev Bawa to authorize him to depose in this case. He has also admitted that he cannot not show any resolution passed by Board of Directors in favour of M.D. or Sanjeev Bawa to authorize Ashok Kumar Prashar to depose in this case. He has admitted that this complaint has been filed through R.K. Goyal and after his retirement Mohinder Pal was substituted. He has admitted that he himself is retired employee. It is not explained by complainant that why R.K. Goyal who was also retired has not been produced. After this cross-examination and just to fill up lacuna Mohinder Pal, Section Officer (Legal) has been examined as CW.2 but he could not tell anything about the case. He has rather demolished the case when stated that after retirement of R.K. Goyal on 30.9.2009, no resolution is on record upto 10.1.2013 to represent this case. So, the learned trial Court has returned the findings which has no legal base nor any evidence is on record. The complaint has not been filed by authorized person nor witness CW.1 is duly authorized to depose on behalf of complainant company. Next plea as raised by learned counsel for appellant is that this cheque was given as security cheque and purpose was not to repay any legal debt. In this regard the evidence of complainant is very much relevant. In cross-examination CW.1 Ashok Kumar could not produce any of the record vide which accused No.1 Navrattan Steel Company purchased any steel from complainant company. He is confronted regarding producing the purchase orders and he has stated that same are not traceable in record. He could not tell how many purchase orders were there by accused company. He has also admitted that amount of payment is to be determined from the purchase orders. He has admitted that no purchase order was taken from Navrattan Steel. He has admitted that complainant company supply the material on demand of concerned person and request can be oral or may be in writing. He could not show any document pertaining to demand raised by accused No.1 company. Even he could not show that this material was received under signatures of competent person of Navrattan Steels. He has produced copy of invoice but again admitted that on carbon copy of this invoice which he has provided in the Court on that day there is overwriting and tampering. So, it is also not explained if there was any legal debt against which this cheque in question was issued. He himself has rather admitted that whosoever comes for purchase of steel, that party is to furnish security against that booking. The security is in the shape of cheque/bank draft for some percentage of total material. So, the witness of complainant itself demolished the case of complainant before the learned trial Court. As the complainant has failed to produce on record any cogent evidence that there was no supply of steel and there was any amount due for such supply against which this cheque in question was issued. The learned trial Court has made presumptions which is against the law. The present appellant is not responsible and he had no legal liability which he has to fulfill and against which he has given any such cheque. It is not accused who has to got produce documents from complainant company against his own interests. It is rather complainant company who has to explain and produce all the documents fixing legal liability of accused-appellant. So, in considered view of this Court, learned trial Court has given findings which are against the law and such findings as returned in the judgment under appeal are not sustainable. I reverse the same. There is no criminal legal liability of accused-appellant and he has been wrongly held guilty. I hereby set aside the judgment of conviction and order of sentence. This appeal is hereby allowed and consequently, appellant is hereby acquitted. Appellant is directed to furnish bonds in the sum of 10,000/- with one? surety in the like amount, in terms of Section 437-A of Cr.P.C. Record of learned trial Court be sent back along with copy of judgment. Appeal file be consigned to the record room.\"\n",

After considering this finding, this Court is of view that it is also supposition and such finding by trial Court is not based on any material on record. Nowhere it is established from the evidence as led by complainant that appellant is in any way acting as Managing Director of the company-respondent No.1 before trial Court. In this regard the authority is relied upon by learned counsel for appellant cited as 2012 (2) RCR (Criminal) 854 titled Aneeta Hada vs. M/s Godfather Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd. wherein it is held by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that prosecution of director of company without arraying the company as accused and in such situation the proceedings have been quashed by holding that Directors could not be executed without company being arrayed as an accused. In the case in hand although company-respondent No.1 has been impleaded as accused but during the proceedings of this case company has never been summoned through MD nor service has been effected through MD. The Court itself has conceded one Gurvinder Singh, Director to represent the company. Once the accused No.1 has never been served nor any notice of accusation has been given by the Court to the said company nor such notice of accusation has been given to appellant to represent the company then it is strange enough that how trial Court has returned the findings itself by holding that accused No.2 hereby appellant represent company accused No.1. These findings are against the spirit of settled principles of law by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India authority. So, such findings are not sustainable. The director of company is only vicariously liable when company is held criminally liable. On the next point of cheque returning memo Exhibit C5, it has been vigorously argued by counsel for appellant that photo copy cannot be admitted in evidence by Court being not even secondary evidence and mere exhibition does not dispense with its proof. Exhibit C5 is photo copy. The trial Court has returned the findings that at the time of its exhibition accused has not objected and if such objection would have been there the complainant would have got the opportunity to remove the same by producing the original or by examining the bank official. This is not duty of accused to point out what document has to be proved by complainant. It is rather duty of Court to see if such evidence as produced on record and photo copy of document is exhibited without producing original of the same, that whether it is admissible or not. In the evidence CW.1 Ashok Kumar who has produced all these documents including photo copy of memo Exhibit C5. Perusal of trial Court file shows that there are two memos of the bank regarding dishonouring of cheque one is dated 7.4.2001 and it is produced in original, Exhibit C5 is photo copy and there are many cuttings on it. Witness of complainant has admitted in cross-examination that original of Exhibit C5 is not on record in both the complaints. He has also admitted that as per Exhibit C5 the reason of dishonouring is that \\\"signatures are incomplete as second signatory was required to sign\\\". This document is very crucial document. The serious doubt has been there put by accused side that this cheque was not dishonoured due to \\\"funds insufficient\\\" but it was due to reason that \\\"drawer's signatures incomplete as second signatures was required\\\". So, ignoring this fact by learned trial Court is not logical and learned trial Court has simply rejected this contention by returning the finding that it hardly matters as both the reasons are within the powers of accused. In considered view of this Court, the learned trial Court has given wrong interpretation of law and such finding has been returned by the Court without any material on record in this context. In the criminal jurisprudence it is always that the prosecution or complainant side which has to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. No such evidence has been brought on record by complainant regarding the fact that any such memo in original is existing on the record nor any permission has been taken to prove it by way of secondary evidence. Photo copy of this memo is not secondary evidence. Moreover, when serious doubt is there on the basis of cuttings on it that whether dishonour was due to insufficient funds or due to incomplete signatures. In this regard law has been relied upon by learned counsel for appellant in case Smt. J. Yashoda vs. Smt. K. Shobha Rani 2007(2) RCR (Civil) 840 Supreme Court wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has settled the law that photo copies of original cannot be received as secondary evidence in terms of Section 63 of Evidence Act. It is also settled that so long as higher or superior evidence is in possession of a party that party shall not give any inferior proof in relation to it. The law settled by Hon'ble Supreme Court is fully applicable to present case. Further law has been cited by learned counsel for appellant titled Vinod Tanna vs. Zaheer Siddiqui 2002(1) RCR (Criminal) 622 Supreme Court wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid down the law that if cheque is dishonoured as signatures on the cheque were incomplete then no offence is made out under Section 138. So, in considered view of this Court, the trial Court has not properly interpreted this law although cited the same. So, such findings are not sustainable and is reversed. The next point of contention is regarding mistake in the name of accused No.2. The cheque in question is proved on record as Exhibit C3 allegedly signed by Gurinder Singh appellant. No such record has been produced on record by complainant that any Gurvinder Singh is Director. Legal notice Exhibit C6 is proved on record which is sent to Gurvinder Singh through registered AD post as well as UPC. No evidence has been brought on record by complainant that Gurvinder Singh and Gurinder Singh are one and the same persons. While returning findings the learned trial Court has pre-judged this point as at the very start of returning findings Court has returned the finding that this objection is also not sustainable as Courts are for the purpose of doing effective justice considering the merits of case and not to cause its miscarriage by going into technicalities. There is no such pleadings nor evidence but Court has given findings on its own to the respect that it is only human error and it is mere clerical/typographical mistake in writing name as Gurvinder Singh instead of Gurinder Singh. Again there is no pleading by the complainant nor evidence that such mistake was not done intentionally. The Court again at its own has returned the findings that there was no such intentional act in committing such mistake. Rather Court has given the findings that it was accused who has to give evidence to make it clear. Again these findings are against criminal jurisprudence as it is not accused who has to make clear case of the prosecution and negative evidence has not to be led by accused. The Court at its own has gone through report of service constable on the warrants issued for 22.11.2002 where he has reported that wife of Gurvinder Singh was present and she intimated that her husband has gone to Ludhiana. The Court has taken judicial notice of such report of Constable which is absolutely not per se admissible nor such report has been authenticated by independent witness. Even such evidence has not been led by complainant. The Court has returned such findings on the basis of such report by Constable which is not permissible under the law. The learned trial Court has further returned the findings on the point that when accused admits his signatures on the cheque and he has failed to convince the Court that he has been prejudiced due to wrong mentioning of his name and objection has been turned down by the trial Court. In considered view of this Court, again it is mere supposition by the trial Court and this authority by Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana cited as V.K. Gupta vs. Manjit Kaur 2008(3) RCR (Criminal) 430 P&H is wrongly made applicable to the facts of this case. This judgment is also relied upon by counsel for appellant. In this authority the Hon'ble High Court has given the finding that trial Court has no power to allow correction in the complaint. As per the facts of this case before Hon'ble High Court, complainant erroneously mentioned the date of presentation of cheque and date of dishonour of the same and the Hon'ble High Court has given the finding that in such situation complainant has to suffer for defects and Magistrate has no power to return the complaint for removing the defects. So, in considered view of this Court, the learned trial Court has wrongly interpreted the law settled by Hon'ble High Court. As such, finding on this point by learned trial Court is also not sustainable. Another point has been argued regarding service of legal notice and admissibility of postal receipts. The trial Court has returned the finding that accused has not disputed the fact that complete address reflected in the legal notice was not correct or same was incomplete. The trial Court has given findings that on postal receipt only house number of accused has not been mentioned, it cannot be said that same is fatal to case of complainant. There is no case of complainant that postal department mentions address in this way but Court has drawn such inference on the basis of postal receipt. The learned trial Court has further given the finding that even in case registered cover has been sent to incomplete address, the accused would have been served through the notice sent by ordinary post. It is again strange to this Court that as per law under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act a legal notice has to be served mandatorily through registered AD post. The trial Court has given contradictory findings as on the one hand it has stated that due to incomplete address registered cover has not been served and it is not presumed under law that ordinary post is surely delivered to the addressee. The learned trial Court has gone to this extent of returning the finding that even in case the Court comes to the conclusion that no notice has been received by accused, in that case also no benefit can be given to him in view of settled law by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sunil vs. Delhi Administration 1981(2) SCR 793. In this regard the trial Court has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Hoshiar Singh vs. State of Punjab 1979(3) SCR 876. In this regard the trial Court has further given the finding that even this legal notice was not served on accused in terms of Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. So, such findings are not sustainable. Learned counsel for appellant has further relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sushila Aggarwal vs. CBI 2004(4) SCC 164 wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has given the finding that under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, presumption of delivery arises only when notice is sent by registered post with acknowledgement due and not when notice is sent by registered post without acknowledgment due. In this regard it is settled law by Hon'ble Supreme Court that if incomplete address is mentioned in legal notice and such notice is sent by registered post without acknowledgment due then no presumption arises that such notice is duly received by accused. In the considered view of this Court the trial Court has given wrong interpretation of law. So, such findings by learned trial Court are not sustainable. Lastly argument has been advanced regarding power of attorney and authority of Vinod Tanna vs. Zaheer Siddiqui 2002(1) RCR (Criminal) 622 Supreme Court wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has given the finding that cheque is dishonoured as signatures are incomplete as second signatures was required. In the considered view of this Court the trial Court has given wrong interpretation of law. So, such findings are not sustainable. In the light of above discussion the impugned judgments of learned trial Court as well as learned appellate court are liable to be set aside and the present appeal is allowed. Accordingly, the present appeal is allowed. The judgments of learned trial Court as well as learned appellate court are set aside. The complaint filed by the complainant is accepted and the accused Nos. 1 and 2 are found guilty of offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act and they are directed to jointly and severally pay a compensation of Rs. 22.00 lacs to the complainant within a period of two months from today. In case the accused fail to pay the said amount of compensation within the said period of two months then they shall be further directed to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year. In case the accused deposits the said amount of compensation within the said period of two months from today then the sentence of simple imprisonment for a period of one year shall stand cancelled. Sd/- JUDGE 21.01.2016 - \"  From the above order of the Court, the following prima facie emerges:  (i) The allegations levelled against the respondents are that the respondent No. 1 company was supposed to pay a certain amount of money to the complainant but as the company was short of funds, it issued a cheque which was dishonoured by the bank.

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. This judgment shall dispose of two appeals bearing RSA No.2424 and 4747 of 2019, arising from a common judgment passed by the learned trial Court as well as First Appellate Court while deciding a suit filed by the respondent for possession of the suit property and for recovery of rent. The undisputed facts of the case are that on 07.02.2014, three documents were executed between the parties:-\\n\\n(1) A registered sale deed dated 07.02.2014 transferring the suit property in favour of the plaintiff by defendant-appellant.\\n\\n(2) A Memorandum of Understanding executed between the parties providing for an agreement to buy back at predetermined price on or before 06.02.2017.\\n\\n(3) A lease deed executed on 07.02.2014 leasing out the suit property by the plaintiff in favour of the defendant @ Rs. 11,22,000/- per month. It is not disputed by learned counsel for the parties that the registered sale deed is an absolute sale of the property and title passed from the defendant to the plaintiff on execution of the sale deed dated 07.02.2014. It may be significant to note that the sale deed neither incorporates any condition nor any clause providing for agreement to buy back the property at a predetermined price. A Memorandum of Understanding has been executed between the parties to this lis. The relevant Clauses 1, 3, 4 and 6 of the Memorandum of Understanding are extracted as under:- \"1. In pursuance of this MOU and in consideration of a sum of Rs. 2,82,00,000/- (Rupees two crores and eighty two lakhs only) to be paid by BUYER to Mr. Sunil Kumar Dahiya, Mr. Sunil Kumar Dahiya shall execute a sale deed in favour of the BUYER in respect of the property and shall also deliver the original documents of the property to the BUYER.\\n\\n3. BUYER agree not to create any encumbrances and shall not sell, gift, exchange, mortgage or alienate in any other manner nor shall assign its/their interest in the PROPERTY of whatsoever nature, nor shall create any charge or encumbrance on the PROPERTY during the subsistence of this MOU.\\n\\n4. Mr. Sunil Kumar Dahiya shall on 6th February, 2017, buy-back the PROPERTY from the BUYER at a value of Rs. 4,20,00,000/- (Rupees four crores and twenty lakhs only). Buyer confirm that the PROPERTY shall be free from any encumbrances at the time of buy-back, in pursuance of this MOU, the parties have also entered into an agreement to sell and purchase in respect of the PROPERTY for the transfer of PROPERTY back to Mr. Sunil Kumar Dahiya. It is agreed that Mr. Sunil Kumar Dahiya shall make payment of the said Rs. 4,20,00,000/- (Rupees four crores and twenty lakhs only) on 6th February 2017 itself and the BUYER shall not dispute the buy-back or sale of the PROPERTY back to Mr. Sunil Kumar Dahiya.\\n\\n6. In case of any 5 consecutively cheque's dishonoring by Mr. Sunil Kumar Dahiya, then this MOU, the lease deed and the agreement to sell and purchase between Seller and Buyer (to be executed tomorrow) shall stand null and void, and the buyer can sell the property to recover its invested amount.\" . It is also undisputed that there was no agreement to sell executed between the parties as provided under Clause 4. It is the positive case of the plaintiff that since the plaintiff did not agree, therefore, no agreement to sell was executed.  Next document is lease deed dated 07.02.2014. It is provided in the unregistered and unstamped lease deed, that the plaintiff has given on lease the suit property to the defendant on a monthly rent of Rs. 11,22,000/-. The monthly payment has been secured through post dated cheques issued by the defendant in favour of the plaintiff. 7. At the outset, it is important to notice that the counsel appearing for the defendant has not contended that there was any relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties. Rather, on the other hand, learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that suit is not maintainable as there was no relationship of landlord and tenant. 8. At this stage, it must be noticed that the defendant although appeared in the suit and filed various applications, however, thereafter, did not choose to contest. He did not file written statement or produced any evidence in the suit.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel appearing for the appellant has submitted that on co-joint reading of the three documents, referred to above, it is apparent that there was a loan transaction between the parties and therefore, the Courts have erred in decreeing the suit. On collective reading of the documents executed between the parties, it is apparent that it was a case of conditional mortgage and therefore, the Courts have erred. He further submitted that the possession of the suit property never changed hands and therefore, sale was also not complete.  He further submitted that the lease deed being unstamped and unregistered was not admissible in evidence and therefore, the Courts erred in relying thereupon. He further submitted that as per Clause 6 of the Memorandum of Understanding, dishonour of five consecutive cheques has not been proved and therefore, also the suit filed by the plaintiff is premature. He further submitted that the defendant-appellant has been acquitted in all eight cases filed by the plaintiff under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the defendant. 1. Next argument of learned counsel for the appellant is with respect to non-transfer of possession and, therefore, the sale between the parties is not complete.  Next argument of learned counsel is with reference to the lease deed which was executed between the parties being unstamped and unregistered and, therefore, not admissible in evidence. Next argument of learned counsel for the appellant is based upon Clause 6 of the Memorandum of Understanding. It may be noted here that the plaintiff has positively pleaded in the plaint that consecutive cheques have been dishonoured.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n15. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the respondent-plaintiff has supported the judgments passed by the Courts below and has prayed for dismissal of the appeals.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nLearned trial Court, on appreciation of evidence, decreed the suit for possession filed by the plaintiff, however, declined to grant relief of recovery of arrears of rent on the ground that the rate of rent is exorbitant and therefore, not recoverable. . Two first appeals were filed, one by the defendant and second by the plaintiff. Learned First Appellate Court, on re-appreciation of evidence, has dismissed the appeal filed by the defendant whereas partly accepted the appeal filed by the plaintiff, thereby, ordering recovery of rent at the rate of Rs. 1,00,000/- per month.  It is appropriate to notice that the defendant-appellant filed the petition for grant of Special Leave to Appeal (C) No(s).15417 of 2019, which has been dismissed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court with the following order:-\\n\\n\"We do not find any good ground to entertain this Special Leave Petition against the impugned order.\\n\\nThe Special Leave Petition is, accordingly, dismissed.\\n\\nThe High Court is requested to dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as possible.\\n\\nPending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed of.\"\n",
    "Case_Result": "That's how these two appeals have been filed by the defendant against the concurrent judgments passed by the Courts below.3. This Court has heard learned counsel for the parties at length and with their able assistance gone through the judgments passed by the Courts below and the requisitioned record.16. On critical analysis of the judgments passed by the Courts below and the record coupled with the submissions of learned counsel for the parties, this Court now proceeds to examine the case.. As regards first argument of learned counsel for the appellant, it may be noted that from the co-joint reading of all the three documents, it cannot be stated that the entire transaction between the parties was only a loan transaction. Majority of the transaction entered into between the parties depict that the parties had entered into sale and purchase of the immovable property with an option to the vendor to buy back the property at a predetermined price within a predetermined period. The sale in favour of the plaintiff is absolute and it is not based upon any restriction. The title in the suit property passed on to the plaintiff, upon the execution of the sale deed. No doubt, in the Memorandum of Understanding, there are certain restrictions on the vendee with respect to creation of encumbrance, sale, gift, exchange, mortgage or alienate or assign the interest in the property sold, however, these are part of a separate agreement. Still further, no doubt, on careful reading of Clause 6, it appears that the vendee was given right to dispose of the property and recover invested amount, however, that itself shall not be sufficient to record a finding that it was only a loan transaction. As noticed above, the nature of transactions between the parties clearly depict a combination of transfer of the property with right to buy back at a predetermined price alongwith simultaneous lease of the suit property in favour of the vendor. In view thereof, this Court does not find that the transaction between the parties was only a loan transaction.Next argument of learned counsel is with reference to conditional mortgage as provided in Section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (hereinafter to be referred as \"the 1882 Act\"). Section 58 of the 1882 Act is extracted as under:-19. Clause (c) of Section 58 of the 1882 Act, makes it amply clear that no such transaction shall be deemed to be a mortgage unless a condition is embodied in the document which effects or purports to effect the sale deed. In other words, unless the condition of mortgage is incorporated in the document of transfer/sale, it cannot be treated as mortgage by conditional sale as is sought to be projected by learned counsel for the appellant. Although, it is not argued by learned counsel for the appellant, however, this transaction would not even fall within the scope of English Mortgage as provided in Clause (e) of Section 58 of the 1882 Act, because the mortgagor has not bound himself to repay the mortgage money on a certain date.Before a document can said to be an English Mortgage, it is necessary that the mortgagor binds himself to repay the mortgage money on a certain date. In this regard, reference can be made to the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Raj Kishore (Dead) by LRs Vs. Prem Singh and others, (2011) 1 SCC 657.20. In view of the aforesaid authoritative pronouncement, there can hardly be any doubt that the transaction between the parties does not fall within the meaning of mortgage by conditional sale. Appeals Dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9ad1\n**Facts**: These three Criminal Petition Nos.3944, 3945 and 3946 of 2016 are directed against the impugned order dated 18.01.2016 in Crl.A.No.992/2015, Crl.A.No.993/2015 and Crl.A.No.994/2015 respectively passed by learned LVI Addl. City Civil & Sessions Judge, Bengaluru City. Since common questions of law and facts are involved in the matters, all these petitions are disposed of by this common order.  The essential facts necessary for disposal of these petitions are as follows:-\\n\\n(i) Petitioner (herein referred to as 'accused'), as power-of-attorney of M/s.Anushka Investments, a partnership firm, haivng its office at J.C. Road, Bangalore and also representing himself as the Managing Partner of M/s.Gold Enterprises and Property Developers, executed an agreement of sale dated 2.1.2018 in favour of respondent herein/complainant. As per the said agreement, the petitioner agreed to sell 6.76% of undivided share, right, title and interest in the land bearing Municipal corporation No.17/1, situated in Millers Road, Bangalore - 560046 for a sale consideration of Rs. 33,75,000/-.  Apart from the said agreement of sale, he also entered into another agreement for construction dated 2.1.2008 for a total price of Rs. 76,25,000/-. As per the terms and conditions of the said agreement dated 2.1.2008, the complainants jointly paid an aggregate amount of Rs. 64,50,000/- to the petitioner under various cheques. Petitioner/accused being unable to perform his part of the obligation under the aforesaid agreement of sale and agreement of construction, sought for cancellation of the agreements and offered to refund the amount of Rs. 64,50,000/- to the complainants and accordingly, the parties entered into an Memorandum of Understanding dated 19.12.2011 whereunder the petitioner/accused agreed to repay a sum of Rs. 64,50,000/- with an additional amount of Rs. 80,50,000/- aggregating to Rs. 1,45,00,000/- and issued three post-dated cheques in favour of the complainants for Rs. 60,00,000/-, Rs. 71,00,000/- and Rs. 14,00,000/- respectively. ) The said cheques, when presented for encashment were dishonoured for insufficient funds.\\n\\n(v) The complainants issued a joint demand notice dated 06.11.2012 calling upon the petitioner/accused to pay amount of the cheques. Petitioner/accused having failed to comply with the demand, respondent/complainants presented three separate complaints before the court below under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short \"N.I. Act\") which were numbered as C.C.No.3510/2013, C.C.No.3511/2013 and C.C.No.3512/2013 respectively.  In support of their claim, respective complainant in C.C.No.3510/2013 examined himself before the Trial Court as PW.1 and produced in evidence 11 documents as per Ex.P1 to Ex.P11. In C.C.No.3511/2013 and C.C.No.3512/2013, 12 documents each were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P12. (viii) In rebuttal, petitioner/accused examined himself as DW.1 and did not produce any documentary evidence. These orders are challenged by the petitioner/accused before this Court under section 482 Cr.P.C.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: . The Trial Court negatived these contentions and by its order dated 02.07.2015, found the accused guilty of the above offences under section 138 of N.I. Act and accordingly, sentenced him to pay fine of Rs. 65,10,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for one year in C.C.No.3510/2013, fine of Rs. 76,10,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for one year in C.C.No.3511/2013 and fine of Rs. 15,10,000/-, in default to undergo simple imprisonment for one year in C.C.No.3512/2013. The Appellate Court considered the said applications along with the main appeal and by the impugned judgment, set-aside the orders passed by the learned Magistrate in C.C.No.3510/2013, C.C.No.3511/2013 and C.C.No.3512/2013 and allowed the applications filed by the complainant under section 319 of Cr.P.C. and consequently, permitted the complainant to implead or insert the firm of accused Nos.2 and 3, as prayed for in the applications. For the said purpose, the matter was remitted to the Trial Court for fresh disposal in accordance with law after permitting the complainant to array the firms as accused Nos.2 and 3 as per the applications.  Learned Sessions Judge has brushed aside the objections raised by the petitioner to the maintainability of the applications under section 319 of Cr.P.C. These applications were beyond the powers of the Appellate Court.  Learned Sessions Judge has exceeded his jurisdiction by allowing the applications since the language of section 319 Cr.P.C. did not authorize filing of such applications at the stage of appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  In the course of trial, petitioner/accused took up the following contentions:-\\n\\n(i) That the cheques in question belonged to M/s.Gold Enterprises-a firm, but the complaints were filed against the accused in his individual capacity. Since the cheques did not belong to the personal account of accused, the petitioner/accused is not liable to pay the amount of the cheques.  Cheques were drawn in the account maintained by M/s. Gold Enterprises which was a firm and since the firm was not arrayed as a party, the complaints were not maintainable.\\n\\n(iii) The consolidated notice demanding payment of three separate cheques was not in accordance with section 138 of N.I. Act and based on the said notice, the complaints could not have been maintained.  Petitioner challenged the above orders in Criminal Appeal Nos.992/2015, 993/2015 and 994/2015. During the pendency of the appeals, respondent/complainant filed applications under section 319 of Cr.P.C., seeking to permit the complainant to bring the firm M/s.Gold Enterprises and Property Developers and M/s Gold Enterprises as accused Nos.2 and 3 in the original complaint in view of decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Aneeta Hada vs. Godfather Travels & Tours Pvt. Ltd., 2012 AIR SCW 2693.   The contentions of the petitioners are that learned Appellate Judge has erred in holding that the Company or Firm can be arrayed as a party under section 319 of Cr.P.C. This finding is illegal in the light of the law laid down by the Constitution Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case HARDEEP SINGH vs. STATE OF PUNJAB, (2014) 3 SCC 92. Learned Appellate Judge has also erred in relying upon the decision of the Delhi and Jarkhand High Courts to hold that a Company can be arrayed at any stage as a party under section 319 of Cr.P.C. This observation is contrary to the settled position of law.   Learned counsel for petitioner has argued in line with the contentions urged in the memorandum of petition and placing reliance on the various judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court as well as various High Courts, emphasized that in view of clear law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Aneeta Hada referred supra, the prosecution of petitioner/accused without making the firm a prime accused, in legally not tenable.  Learned counsel has placed reliance on the recent decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in N.HARIHARA KRISHNAN vs. J.THOMAS, AIR 2017 SC 4125 and pointed out that, every person signing a cheque on behalf of a Company on whose account a cheque is drawn, does not become the drawer of the cheque.  Such a signatory is only a person authorized to sign the cheque on behalf of the Company or drawer of the cheque and therefore the prosecution of the petitioner being opposed to Section 142 of N.I.Act, are liable to be quashed\n**Argument by Respondent**: The contention of learned counsel for respondent is that, \"Firm\" is not a legal entity qua partner. In view of section 18 of the Partnership Firm Act, 1932, every partner is the agent of the firm for the purposes of the business of the firm and by virtue of section 19 of the Partnership Act, an act of a partner does not, in the usual course of business, binds the firm.  A partnership firm is not a legal entity. The position of a partner qua a firm is in not in the nature of Master and servant. Hence, the law laid down in the case of Aneeta Hada's case, supra, which was rendered in the context of a Company which is a juristic person, cannot be made applicable in the case of partnership firm which is not a separate juristic person. Further the decision in Aneeta Hada case is only an authority for what it decided and hence there is no case for interference in the matter. . I have bestowed my careful thought to the rival contentions urged at the Bar and have carefully scrutinized the material on record.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: i) Insofar as the maintainability of an application under Section 319 Cr.P.C. after pronouncement of judgment is concerned, learned counsel for petitioner has placed reliance on the decision in HARDEEP SINGH vs. STATE OF PUNJAB, (2014) 3 SCC 92, to bring home the point that such an application could be filed at any time before pronouncement of judgment and not thereafter. In this regard, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in para 47 of the above judgment, has observed as under:  In the instant case, undisputedly, the applications were moved by the complainants during the pendency of appeals. These applications were filed seeking to implead M/s.Gold Enterprises and Property Developers and M/s Gold Enterprises, as respondent Nos. 2 and 3 in the respective complaint. The impleaded party has not challenged the said order. Petitioner is not affected by the said order. The aggrieved party himself having not questioned the order passed by the First Appellate Court, in my view, this question cannot be gone into at the instance of the petitioner. Undisputedly, initially the complaint was filed only against the petitioner in his capacity as the Managing Partner of M/s.Gold Enterprises and Property Developers. The firm M/s. Gold Enterprises and Property Developers was not made a party to the proceedings. But the averments made in the complaint go to show that the alleged transaction was entered into with the Firm and not with the petitioner in his individual capacity. As such, the Firm was required to be made a party.  This position is impliedly accepted by the Appellate Court by directing the Firm to be made as a party.   Law is now well settled that the scheme of prosecution under section 138 of N.I. Act is different from the scheme of Code of Criminal Procedure. Section 138 of N.I. Act defines the offence and prescribes punishment. It does not prescribe any procedure for investigation of offences. Nonetheless in order to constitute an offence under section 138 of N.I. Act, each and every ingredient of section 138 of N.I. Act is required to be satisfied. Those ingredients are:- (i) that a person drew a cheque on an account maintained by him with the banker;\\n\\n(ii) that such a cheque when presented to the bank was returned by the bank unpaid;\\n\\n(iii) that such a cheque was presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date it was drawn or within the period of its validity whichever is earlier;\\n\\n(iv) that the payee demanded in writing from the drawer of the cheque the payment of the amount of money due under the cheque to payee; and\\n\\n(v) such a notice of payment is made within a period of 30 days from the date of the receipt of the information by the payee from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid.\\n\\n(vi) the drawer of the cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice.  In the instant case, undisputedly, the cheques in question are seem to have been signed by the petitioner herein as the authorized signatory of M/s.Gold Enterprises which is not a party to the proceedings before learned Magistrate. It is also not in dispute that the subject cheques were drawn on the account maintained in the name of the Firm namely M/s Gold Enterprises. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in N.HARIHARA KRISHNAN case, referred supra, \"every person signing a cheque on behalf of a Company on whose account a cheque is drawn does not become the drawer of the cheque. Such a signatory is only a person duly authorised to sign the cheque on behalf of the Company/drawer of the cheque.\" Under the said circumstances, merely on account of subscribing his signature to the subject cheques as authorized signatory, the petitioner does not render himself liable for the consequences of dishonour of the said cheques. Therefore, it follows that in order to maintain the prosecution for dishonour of the subject cheques, notice of dishonour ought to have been given to the drawer of the cheques namely M/s. Gold Enterprises and the complaint ought to have been filed against M/s.Gold Enterprises within the time prescribed under clause (c) of the proviso to Section 138 of N.I. Act lest it would be barred in view of Section 142(1)(b) of N.I. Act. But, undeniably, none of these requirements are seem to have been complied in the instant case nor could they be complied at this point of time insofar as the proposed party is concerned.  The proposed party is totally a new entity which is sought to be added as co-accused without compliance of preconditions laid down under section 138 of N.I. Act. Since the material produced before learned Magistrate did not prima facie disclose the commission of the offences by the proposed party, learned Magistrate did not derive jurisdiction to proceed against the proposed party even under section 319 of Cr.P.C.  No doubt, courts below have proceeded on the premise that M/s.Gold Enterprises and Property Developers and M/s.Gold Enterprises are sister concerns and both are managed by the petitioner herein as its Managing Partner and therefore, the defect in the complaint could be cured by impleading the drawer Firms namely M/s.Gold Enterprises and M/s.Gold Enterprises and Property Developers under Section 319 Cr.P.C.  This approach, in my view, is not permissible in view of the provisions of N.I. Act under which the prosecution could be maintained against the drawer of the cheque only after compliance of the requirements prescribed therein and that too, within the time limit as stipulated therein. Since the proposed party namely M/s.Gold Enterprises or M/s.Gold Enterprises and Property Developers were not issued with the statutory notice within the prescribed period and no prosecution was launched against them within the time stipulated under section 142(1)(b) of N.I. Act, no cause of action had arisen entitling the complainant to proceed against the proposed party under section 319 of Cr.P.C. That apart, the initial prosecution having been launched only against the petitioner namely one of the partners of M/s.Gold Enterprises and Property Developers, without making the Firm a party, in view of the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Aneeta Hada case that a partner alone could not be prosecuted on the touchstone of vicarious liability without the Firm being arrayed as a prime accused, this fundamental defect cannot be cured by recourse to Section 319 of Cr.P.C., at the appellate stage.\n",

This is an application for placing on record accompanying documents viz. cheque dated 01.10.2016 along with bank memo dated 25.10.2016, cheque dated 01.10.2016 along with bank memo dated 13.10.2016, full and final settlement/agreement dated 18.12.2015 and annual filing before ROC. For the reasons mentioned in the application, the same is allowed. Accompanying documents are taken on record subject to all just exceptions. CRM-M No.16269 of 2018 [1]. Petitioner has preferred this petition for setting aside the order dated 31.01.2017 passed by Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Patiala, summoning the petitioner and others to face trial under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and order dated 01.03.2018 passed by Additional Sessions Judge, Patiala, vide which revision petition filed by the petitioner against the order dated 31.01.2017 was dismissed. [  Brief facts of the case are that the respondent filed a criminal complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against M/s D.S.G. Papers Pvt. Ltd. through its Director and authorized signatory Manoj Kumar, Manoj Kumar son of Suraj Bhan Gupta, Director M/ s DSG Papers Pvt. Ltd and Neeru Gupta (petitioner). Complainant/respondent has pleaded that presently, he is living in U.S.A. Complaint has been filed through his brother Sanjay Dhawan as Special Power of Attorney. Complainant has pleaded that accused No.2 i.e. Manoj Kumar was having family relations with the family of the complainant. The accused were running the firm in the name and style of D.S.G. Papers Pvt. Limited and the accused allured the complainant and his family members to invest money in the business of the aforesaid firm and they assured 20% shares to the complainant and his family members The complainant believed the accused and invested an amount of Rs.33,70,000/- in the firm of the accused. The amount was transferred from complainant's ICICI Bank NRI Account to the account of the accused. The accused allotted 3,09,250 shares of the company in favour of the complainant. Some shares were allotted to brother, father and sister-in-law of the complainant as per their investment. After some time, the accused demanded more money from the family of the complainant. Family members of the complainant were not in a position to pay the amount to the accused. For this reason, the accused asked the father of the complainant to mortgage his house and stood as personal guarantee to secure loan for his company. Due to good relations with the accused and allurement given by the accused, the father of the complainant has mortgaged his house No.7L, Green View, Rajbaha Road, Patiala and stood as personal guarantee to raise funds for the company of the accused. In the year 2012, the accused again contacted the brother of the complainant and asked him to bring the company out of financial crunch.  The accused asked for money, but the complainant showed his inability. Due to persistence and the assurance given by the accused that the amount will be the loan towards the company and the reasonable interest will be paid thereupon, the complainant transferred an amount of Rs.1,04,50,000/- on 14.09.2012 and 15.09.2012 to the company of the accused. It came to the knowledge of the complainant that the accused have allotted 55,000 shares at the rate of Rs.100/- each in the name of the complainant, whereas complainant never asked for the same, rather the amount was a loan towards the company.  ara No.7 of the complaint reads as under:-\\n\"7. That later on when complainant asked accused to return the amount then accused demanded that the shares in the name of the complainant and his family members should be transferred in accused No.2 and accused No.3's name and accused paid Rs.83,77,140/- to complainant and in discharge of his legal debt liability accused issue cheque No.861414 dated 01.10.2016 of ICICI Bank Branch Chhoti Baradari, Patiala for sum of Rs.2,43,73,000/- in favour of complainant as part payment of legally enforceable debt outstanding towards accused persons. At the time of issuing the above said cheque, you assured complainant that the cheque will be honoured as and when the same will be presented for encashment. The cheque on presentation was dishonoured with the remarks of 'insufficiency of funds'. Thereafter, the complainant contacted the accused, but the accused refused to pay the loan amount. The complainant filed an application before IG, NRI Wing, SAS Nagar, Mohali. The accused contacted the complainant and requested for some time with a promise that he will deposit the amount for the clearance of the cheque. Complainant believing the accused granted him further time. In the month of December, the accused again contacted the complainant and asked him to present the cheque for encashment with an assurance that the cheque will be honoured as and when presented for encashment. The complainant again presented the cheque through his brother and power of attorney holder with his bankers i.e. HDFC Bank Patiala, but the cheque was again dishonoured vide memo dated 13.12.2016. The complainant again contacted the accused, but the accused flatly refused to return the amount of cheque. Finding no alternative, the complainant had to initiate legal proceedings. The complainant pleaded in para No.17 of the complaint in the following manner:-\\n\\n\"17. That by means of aforesaid act, the accused has rendered themselves liable to be prosecuted under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as amended.\" Bare perusal of the aforesaid complaint would show that the complainant has not pleaded that the petitioner is incharge and responsible for day to day conduct of the business of the company. Perusal of the aforesaid order dated 31.01.2017 passed by the trial Court would show that the order of summoning is not related to offence under Section 141(2) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is relatable to signatory of the cheque only. The cheque in question was signed by Manoj Kumar as authorized signatory Para No.17 of the said judgment is relevant to be quoted hereasunder:-\\n\\n\"17. There is no dispute that the appellant, who was wife of the Managing Director, was appointed as a Director of the Company-M/S Elite International Pvt. Ltd. on 1st July, 2004 and had also executed a Letter of Guarantee on 19th January, 2005. The cheques in question were issued during April, 2008 to September, 2008. So far as the dishonor of Cheques is concerned, admittedly the cheques were not signed by the appellant. There is also no dispute that the appellant was not the Managing Director but only a non- executive Director of the Company. Non-executive Director is no doubt a custodian of the governance of the Company but does not involve in the day-to-day affairs of the running of its business and only monitors the executive activity. To fasten vicarious liability under Section 141 of the Act on a person, at the material time that person shall have been at the helm of affairs of the Company, one who actively looks after the day-to-day activities of the Company and particularly responsible for the conduct of its business. Simply because a person is a Director of a Company, does not make him liable under the N.I. Act. Every person connected with the Company will not fall into the ambit of the provision. Time and again, it has been asserted by this Court that only those persons who were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company at the time of commission of an offence will be liable for criminal action. A Director, who was not in charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company at the relevant time, will not be liable for an offence under Section 141 of the N.I. Act. In National Small Industries Corporation (supra) this Court observed:\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe complainant has further alleged that by way of inducement, the accused had committed the offence of cheating. Due to aforesaid inducement, the complainant has to part with the property i.e. Rs.2,43,73,000/- and the accused have dishonestly misappropriated the same. After receiving the dishonoured cheque from the banker, the complainant got served legal notice dated 30.12.2016 through his counsel upon all the accused. The accused did not pay the amount even after receipt of legal notice.  Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the cheque in question was not signed by the petitioner and the complaint is silent about the status of the petitioner. The complainant has not pleaded that the petitioner is incharge and responsible for day to day conduct of the business of the company. The petitioner could not have been summoned under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act simplicitor as she is not signatory of the cheque. The complaint in question does not disclose any overt-act on behalf of the petitioner.  The record would indicate that neither in the complaint, nor in the summoning order, any reference has been made to Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act by virtue of which,vicarious liability has been put in place. Petitioner is a lady and she has been implicated solely because she is wife of Manoj Kumar (signatory of the cheque). It would be apposite to mention that a person can be arrayed as accused under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act for advancing vicarious liability of such person.  It is incumbent upon the complainant to aver/plead that the accused was incharge and controller of the company at any point of time. No such averments have been made which are mandatory in nature before invoking provisions of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Petitioner being a lady has no role to play with the day to day affairs of the company. Complainant has preferred not to make any such averment in the complaint and therefore, mandatory requirement in terms of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act has not been complied with. A liability under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is sought to be fastened vicariously on the petitioner as a Director of the company, the principal accused being the company itself. It is a departure from the rule in criminal law against vicarious liability. A clear case should be spelled out in the complaint against the person sought to be made liable. Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act contains the requirements for making a person liable under the said provision. A complaint has to be examined by the Magistrate in the first instance on the basis of averments contained therein. If the Magistrate is satisfied that there are averments which bring the case within Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, then he would issue the process. Merely describing a person as Director in the company is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Even a non- director can be liable under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The averments in the complaint would also serve the purpose that the person sought to be made liable would know what is the case which is alleged against him/her. It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act that when the offence was committed, the accused person was incharge of, and responsible for the conduct of business of the company. This averment is a necessary requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and has to be made in a complaint. In the absence of such averment being made in the complaint, the requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act cannot be said to be satisfied. If the accused is the Managing Director or a Joint Managing Director, it is not necessary to make an averment in the complaint that he is incharge of, and is responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of the company.  In case of a director or an officer of the company who signed the cheque on behalf of the company, there is no need to make a specific averment that he was incharge of and was responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of the company or make any specific allegation about consent, connivance or negligence, but in case of non-signatory and Director, Secretary or Manager of the company, an averment has to be made that he/she was incharge of, and was responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of the company.  Learned counsel further submitted that under vicarious liability on dishonouring of cheque issued by a company, a non- executive Director of a company could not be prosecuted. Non- executive Director is no doubt a custodian of the governance of the company, but does not involve in the day-to-day affairs of the running of its business and only monitors the executive activity. Simply because a person is a Director of a company, does not make him liable under the Negotiable Instruments Act. Only those persons who were incharge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of commission of an offence, will be liable for criminal action. For making a Director of a company liable for the offences committed by the company under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, there must be specific averments against the Director showing as to how and in what manner the Director was responsible for the conduct of the business of the company.  earned counsel by referring to Pooja Ravinder Devidasani's case (supra), submitted that the ratio of aforesaid case fully covers the present controversy.  Learned counsel also submitted that summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter. Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a matter of course. The order of the Magistrate summoning the accused must reflect that he has applied his mind to the facts of the case and the law applicable thereto. The Court has to examine the nature of allegation made in the complaint and the evidence both oral and documentary in support thereof.  The Court has to carefully scrutinize the evidence brought on record and may even himself put questions to the complainant and his witnesses to elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of the allegations or otherwise\nArgument by the Respondent:\nPer contra, learned counsel for the respondent relied upon Sonu Gupta Vs. Deepak Gupta and others, 2015(2) RCR (Criminal) 32, : (AIR 2015 SC (Supp) 684) Dev Raj Garg Vs. State of Punjab, 1997(2) RCR (Criminal) 26 and Smt. Manju Joon Vs. State of Haryana and others, 2009(1) RCR (Criminal) 363 and contended that the pleadings to the effect that the petitioner was active in business of the firm and satisfies the requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. he complaint cannot be quashed on the ground that there was no specific averment in the complaint that the petitioner was incharge and responsible to the firm for conduct of the business. Petitioner would be at liberty to prove before the Court that she was not responsible for conduct of the business of the firm and therefore, not liable. [\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n. Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Patiala vide order dated 31.01.2017, summoned the accused to face trial under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Although, no particular form for making such an allegation is prescribed, but wholesome reading of the complaint would show that the substance of the accusation discloses that the accused person was incharge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time.  I have considered the controversyPerusal of the order dated 31.01.2017 passed by the trial Court, summoning the petitioner would also show that the summoning order is only under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The order does not show that the petitioner has been summoned under Section 141(2) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is relatable to the signatory of the cheque. Sonu Gupta's case (supra) and Dev Raj Garg's case (supra) relates to order of summoning under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. Those cases are related to penal offences, where no such averments are required to be made in the context of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.The requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is somewhat different being of vicarious liability, therefore, requirement of summoning in penal offences is not just at par with that of summoning under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The view expressed in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. case (supra) was further relied by the Hon'ble Apex Court in subsequent judgments i.e. Central Bank of India Vs. Asian Global Limited and others, 2010(11) SCC 203: (AIR 2010 SC 2835 ) Harshanda Kumar \"D\" Vs. Rehati Lata Killey and others, 2011(3) SCC 351, Anita Handa Vs. M/s Godfather Tour and Travels Pvt. Ltd., 2012(2) RCR (Criminal) 854 and Golwal Sales Private Limited Vs. Anu Mehta and others, 2015(1) SCC 103 : (AIR 2015 SC 1072).19. In view of aforesaid settled position of law, it can be seen that the complaint in question is wanting on material particulars. The requirement of law in respect of creating vicarious liability must be strictly construed. Since it is a penal provision, creating vicarious liability, therefore, it is not sufficient to make bald and cursory statement in the complaint that Director is incharge and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company without anything more. Rather in the instant case, no such averments have been made in respect of the petitioner being Director is also incharge and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business.The complaint must contain as to how and in what manner, the Director was incharge or was responsible to the company in conduct of its business. This should be in consonance with strict interpretation of penal statutes, especially, where such statute creates vicarious liability. [20]. In National Small Industries Corporation Vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal and another, 2010(3) SCC 330, the Hon'ble Apex Court has interpreted on the aforesaid lines that requirement in terms of pleading has to be construed not only to the extent of mentioning the Director to be incharge of and responsible to the company for doing its business, but strictly spell out as to how and in what manner, he was incharge and responsible for the conduct of its business.

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "1. In this case, the main issue is whether the lower court correctly applied the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act while deciding the petitioner's liability under Section 138.\n2. Critically analyzing the lower court's judgment, we find that the primary concern is whether the petitioner, being a non-executive director of the company, can be held liable for the offence of dishonouring cheques issued by the company. The lower court has rightly applied the law, as it has considered the arguments presented by both the petitioner and the respondent."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n. This application has been filed seeking leave to file appeal against the judgment of acquittal dated 24.12.2014 passed by the lower appellate Court, vide which, while acquitting the respondents-accused, the judgment of conviction and order of sentence of even date i.e. 20.03.2013 passed by the trial Court, were set aside. Brief facts of the case are that the applicant-complainant had filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'N.I. Act') against the respondents- accused with the allegations that a cheque dated 30.03.2001 amounting to Rs.11.00 lacs, on presentation before the bank, was dishonoured. It is further stated in the complaint that the complainant has supplied HR Coils to accused No.1-Company through various invoices Ex.C1 to Ex.C13 and in partial discharge of the liability, accused No.2 issued a cheque in question Ex.C3 under his signatures on behalf of accused No.1-Company The trial Court has given the finding that Managing Director was not arrayed and summoned as an accused in his individual capacity but only to represent the accused No.1 and same has been represented by accused No.2 Gurinder Singh. The trial Court has further given finding on this point that \"accused No.2 has neither disputed the fact that cheque in question was issued under his signatures nor has disputed the fact that he was no more a director of the company, thus, to my mind he has also been representing the accused No.1 company. After considering this finding, this Court is of view that it is also supposition and such finding by trial Court is not based on any material on record. Nowhere it is established from the evidence as led by complainant that appellant is in any way acting as Managing Director of the company-respondent No.1 before trial Court.  In the case in hand although company-respondent No.1 has been impleaded as accused but during the proceedings of this case company has never been summoned through MD nor service has been effected through MD. The Court itself has conceded one Gurvinder Singh, Director to represent the company. Once the accused No.1 has never been served nor any notice of accusation has been given by the Court to the said company nor such notice of accusation has been given to appellant to represent the company then it is strange enough that how trial Court has returned the findings itself by holding that accused No.2 hereby appellant represent company accused No.1.  These findings are against the spirit of settled principles of law by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India ibid authority. So, such findings are not sustainable. The director of company is only vicariously liable when company is held criminally liable.  On the next point of cheque returning memo Exhibit C5, it has been vigorously argued by counsel for appellant that photo copy cannot be admitted in evidence by Court being not even secondary evidence and mere exhibition does not dispense with its proof. Exhibit C5 is photo copy. The trial Court has returned the findings that at the time of its exhibition accused has not objected and if such objection would have been there the complainant would have got the opportunity to remove the same by producing the original or by examining the bank official. his is not duty of accused to point out what document has to be proved by complainant. It is rather duty of Court to see if such evidence as produced on record and photo copy of document is exhibited without producing original of the same, that whether it is admissible or not. In the evidence CW.1 Ashok Kumar who has produced all these documents including photo copy of memo Exhibit C5. Perusal of trial Court file shows that there are two memos of the bank regarding dishonouring of cheque one is dated 7.4.2001 and it is produced in original, Exhibit C5 is photo copy and there are many cuttings on it. Witness of complainant has admitted in cross-examination that original of Exhibit C5 is not on record in both the complaints. He has also admitted that as per Exhibit C5 the reason of dishonouring is that \"signatures are incomplete as second signatory was required to sign\". This document is very crucial document The serious doubt has been there put by accused side that this cheque was not dishonoured due to \"funds insufficient\" but it was due to reason that \"drawer's signatures incomplete as second signatures was required\". So, ignoring this fact by learned trial Court is not logical and learned trial Court has simply rejected this contention by returning the finding that it hardly matters as both the reasons are within the powers of accused. In considered view of this Court, the learned trial Court has given wrong interpretation of law and such finding has been returned by the Court without any material on record in this context. In the criminal jurisprudence it is always that the prosecution or complainant side which has to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. No such evidence has been brought on record by complainant regarding the fact that any such memo in original is existing on the record nor any permission has been taken to prove it by way of secondary evidence. Photo copy of this memo is not secondary evidence. Moreover, when serious doubt is there on the basis of cuttings on it that whether dishonour was due to insufficient funds or due to incomplete signatures.   It is also settled that so long as higher or superior evidence is in possession of a party that party shall not give any inferior proof in relation to it. The law settled by Hon'ble Supreme Court is fully applicable to present case.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Next point of contention as raised by counsel for appellant is that Senior Officer R.K. Goyal is not competent to file the complaint nor unauthorized person can depose as a witness when complainant company is a registered company under the Companies Act. The law has been settled that company do the work as per resolutions and any person acting on behalf of company shall be duly authorized. No such resolution has been proved on record that complaint has been filed by authorized person or Ashok Kumar who appeared as CW.1 on behalf of company is also authorized to depose. In the evidence when CW.1 Ashok Kumar has been confronted with this situation he could not explain regarding any authority to him to depose or regarding any authority to earlier Law Officer R.K. Goyal to file complaint. He has admitted in cross- examination that Board of Directors of complainant corporation has not given him any authority by way of resolution to depose in this case rather he has further stated that the person who has given him authority has been authorized by the Board of Directors.  He has further admitted that there is no mention of resolution passed by Board of Directors in favour of Sanjeev Bawa to authorize him to depose in this case. He has also admitted that he cannot not show any resolution passed by Board of Directors in favour of M.D. or Sanjeev Bawa to authorize Ashok Kumar Prashar to depose in this case. He has admitted that this complaint has been filed through R.K. Goyal and after his retirement Mohinder Pal was substituted. He has admitted that he himself is retired employee. It is not explained by complainant that why R.K. Goyal who was also retired has not been produced. After this cross-examination and just to fill up lacuna Mohinder Pal, Section Officer (Legal) has been examined as CW.2 but he could not tell anything about the case. He has rather demolished the case when stated that after retirement of R.K. Goyal on 30.9.2009, no resolution is on record upto 10.1.2013 to represent this case. So, the learned trial Court has returned the findings which has no legal base nor any evidence is on record. The complaint has not been filed by authorized person nor witness CW.1 is duly authorized to depose on behalf of complainant company. 16) Next plea as raised by learned counsel for appellant is that this cheque was given as security cheque and purpose was not to repay any legal debt. In this regard the evidence of complainant is very much relevant. In cross-examination CW.1 Ashok Kumar could not produce any of the record vide which accused No.1 Navrattan Steel Company purchased any steel from complainant company. He is confronted regarding producing the purchase orders and he has stated that same are not traceable in record.  He could not tell how many purchase orders were there by accused company. He has also admitted that amount of payment is to be determined from the purchase orders. He has admitted that no purchase order was taken from Navrattan Steel. He has admitted that complainant company supply the material on demand of concerned person and request can be oral or may be in writing. He could not show any document pertaining to demand raised by accused No.1 company. Even he could not show that this material was received under signatures of competent person of Navrattan Steels.  He has produced copy of invoice but again admitted that on carbon copy of this invoice which he has provided in the Court on that day there is overwriting and tampering. So, it is also not explained if there was any legal debt against which this cheque in question was issued. He himself has rather admitted that whosoever comes for purchase of steel, that party is to furnish security against that booking The security is in the shape of cheque/bank draft for some percentage of total material. So, the witness of complainant itself demolished the case of complainant before the learned trial Court. As the complainant has failed to produce on record any cogent evidence that there was no supply of steel and there was any amount due for such supply against which this cheque in question was issued. The learned trial Court has made presumptions which is against the law. The present appellant is not responsible and he had no legal liability which he has to fulfill and against which he has given any such cheque. It is not accused who has to got produce documents from complainant company against his own interests. It is rather complainant company who has to explain and produce all the documents fixing legal liability of accused-appellant. So, in considered view of this Court, learned trial Court has given findings which are against the law and such findings as returned in the judgment under appeal are not sustainable. I reverse the same There is no criminal legal liability of accused-appellant and he has been wrongly held guilty. I hereby set aside the judgment of conviction and order of sentence. This appeal is hereby allowed and consequently, appellant is hereby acquitted. Appellant is ?directed to furnish bonds in the sum of 10,000/- with one surety in the like amount, in terms of Section 437-A of Cr.P.C.  Record of learned trial Court be sent back along with copy of judgment. Appeal file be consigned to the record room.\" Present application seeking leave to appeal is filed against the impugned judgment of acquittal and the same is pending since 2015. The lower Courts record was requisitioned and during the course of arguments, with the assistance of learned counsel for the parties, the same was perused.   Learned counsel for the applicant has argued that the lower appellate Court has, in fact, reversed the findings recorded by the trial Court without assigning good reasons. It is further argued that accused No.2, being Director of accused No.1-Company, is vicariously liable, when accused No.1- Company is held liable for the offence. It is also argued that the lower appellate Court has wrongly held that the memo Ex.C5, vide which the cheque was returned, is not admissible, as no permission to lead secondary evidence was obtained and even record of the complainant Ex.C4 to Ex.C17, being photocopies, is not admissible  It is next argued that the lower appellate Court has wrongly observed that address given in the legal notice was not correct and was incomplete, whereas there is a presumption attached to the notice issued through registered A.D. Post. Learned counsel for the applicant has further argued that the lower appellate Court has observed that the complaint was not filed by the authorized person, whereas CW1 Ashok Kumar was duly authorized by the applicant-Corporation to appear on its behalf and therefore, findings recorded by the lower appellate are incorrect.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nIn reply, learned senior counsel for the respondents has argued that the complaint itself is not maintainable, as accused No.1-Company was impleaded through the Managing Director and nobody was named as Managing Director and therefore, no person on behalf of accused No.1- Company could be convicted, as nobody is named as Managing Director.  It is further argued that there is no evidence on record to show that accused No.2- Director was responsible for day to day business of accused No.1-Company. 21) In support of his arguments, learned senior counsel has relied upon a judgment in Aneeta Hada Vs. M/s Godfather Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd., 2012 (2) RCR (Criminal) 854 to submit that it has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that where the complainant failed to prove that accused, who has been arrayed as Director of the Company, is not responsible for day to day functioning of the Company and he cannot be held guilty.  Learned senior counsel for the respondents has further argued that the documents Ex.C4 to Ex.C17 are photocopies and therefore, they are not admissible in evidence, as originals thereof were not produced on record  It is further argued that even the notice Ex.C6 itself is defective, as it is not mentioned that accused No.1-Company is served through an individual as it is only mentioned 'through its Managing Director'. It is also submitted that even the address given in the notice is incomplete and there is no presumption that the notice was ever served. In this regard, learned senior counsel has relied upon M/s Kumar Exports Vs. M/s Sharma Carpets, 2009 (1) RCR (Criminal) 478, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that where the complainant has not produced the books of account or stock register maintained by him in the course of his regular business, complaint is liable to fail and the accused was acquitted.  It is next argued that even in the return memo Ex.C5, it is stated that the drawer's signatures are incomplete and returned for signatures, as per endorsement No.11 dated 10.07.2001 Learned senior counsel has relied upon Vinod Tanna Vs. Zaheer Siddiqui, 2002 (1) RCR (Criminal) 622, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that if a cheque is dishonoured, as signatures on the cheque were incomplete, no offence is made out.  Learned senior counsel for the respondents has next argued that the complainant has failed to prove on record the authorization in his favour by the Board of Directors of the applicant- Corporation and no such documents has been exhibited on record to show that CW1 Ashok Kumar, who appeared on behalf of the complainant, was authorized person.  Learned senior counsel for the respondents has also argued that in the cross-examination of CW1 Ashok Kumar, it has come that there is no resolution in favour of Sanjeev Bawa, who filed the complaint and he could not produce on record any resolution passed by the Board of Directors in favour of Sanjeev Bawa to authorize Ashok Kumar to depose in the case.  It is further submitted that without following the procedure as per Section 65 of Evidence Act, the photocopies of the documents, without production of originals thereof, mere exhibition of the documents, will not dispense with the mode of proof. Learned senior counsel has relied upon a judgment in Smt. Suvinder Kaur @ Shavinder Kaur Vs. State of Haryana, 2003 (2) RCR (Criminal) 815, wherein similar observations have been made by this Court\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe trial Court, vide its judgment of conviction dated 20.03.2013, held the respondents guilty of offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act and vide order of sentence of even date i.e. 20.03.2013, sentenced accused No.2 to undergo R.I. for a period of two years and to pay a compensation to the tune of Rs.22.00 lacs to the complainant. Thereafter, the respondents filed an appeal before the lower appellate Court and while reversing the judgment of conviction passed by the trial Court, the lower appellate Court allowed the appeal. The operative part of the judgment passed by the lower appellate Court reads as under: - \"First of all argument has been advanced from both the sides and findings have also been returned by learned trial Court on the ground of non joinder of Managing Director of company. The lower appellate Court has further wrongly held that the cheque, in fact, was given as security and was not meant to discharge any liability. \n",
    "Case_Result": "So, in considered view of this Court, the trial Court has not properly interpreted this law although cited the same. So, such findings are not sustainable and is reversedThe next point of contention is regarding mistake in the name of accused No.2. The cheque in question is proved on record as Exhibit C3 allegedly signed by Gurinder Singh appellant. No such record has been produced on record by complainant that any Gurvinder Singh is Director. Legal notice Exhibit C6 is proved on record which is sent to Gurvinder Singh through registered AD post as well as UPC. No evidence has been brought on record by complainant that Gurvinder Singh and Gurinder Singh are one and the same personsWhile returning findings the learned trial Court has pre-judged this point as at the very start of returning findings Court has returned the finding that this objection is also not sustainable as Courts are for the purpose of doing effective justice considering the merits of case and not to cause its miscarriage by going into technicalities. There is no such pleadings nor evidence but Court has given findings on its own to the respect that it is only human error and it is mere clerical/typographical mistake in writing name as Gurvinder Singh instead of Gurinder Singh. Again there is no pleading by the complainant nor evidence that such mistake was not done intentionally.The Court again at its own has returned the findings that there was no such intentional act in committing such mistake. Rather Court has given the findings that it was accused who has to give evidence to make it clearAgain these findings are against criminal jurisprudence as it is not accused who has to make clear case of the prosecution and negative evidence has not to be led by accused. The Court at its own has gone through report of service constable on the warrants issued for 22.11.2002 where he has reported that wife of Gurvinder Singh was present and she intimated that her husband has gone to Ludhiana. The Court has taken judicial notice of such report of Constable which is absolutely not per se admissible nor such report has been authenticated by independent witness. Even such evidence has not been led by complainant. The Court has returned such findings on the basis of such report by Constable which is not permissible under the law. As per the facts of this case before Hon'ble High Court, complainant erroneously mentioned the date of presentation of cheque and date of dishonour of the same and the Hon'ble High Court has given the finding that in such situation complainant has to suffer for defects and Magistrate has no power to return the complaint for removing the defects. So, in considered view of this Court, the learned trial Court has wrongly interpreted the law settled by Hon'ble High Court. As such, finding on this point by learned trial Court is also not sustainable. Another point has been argued regarding service of legal notice and admissibility of postal receipts. The trial Court has returned the finding that accused has not disputed the fact that complete address reflected in the legal notice was not correct or same was incomplete. The trial Court has given findings that on postal receipt only house number of accused has not been mentioned, it cannot be said that same is fatal to case of complainant. There is no case of complainant that postal department mentions address in this way but Court has drawn such inference on the basis of postal receipt. The learned trial Court has further given the finding that even in case registered cover has been sent to incomplete address, the accused would have been served through the notice sent by ordinary post. It is again strange to this Court that as per law under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act a legal notice has to be served mandatorily through registered AD post. The trial Court has given contradictory findings as on the one hand it has stated that due to incomplete address registered cover has not been served and it is not presumed under law that ordinary post is surely delivered to the addressee. The learned trial Court has gone to this extent of returning the finding that even in case the Court comes to the conclusion that no notice has been received by accused, in that case also no benefit can be given to him in view of settled law by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as C.C. Alavi Haji vs. Palapetty Muhammad unreported judgment by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is again wrong application of the law as it is legal and valuable right of accused as enshrined in legislation to receive legal notice upon dishonouring of cheque and giving chance to the accused to make payment. In the given facts and circumstances of the case it is very much needed that complainant has to prove on record that accused has been well served regarding dishonouring of cheque and liability was pointed out in the cheque. The learned trial Court in this regard has further returned the finding to the respect that \"the purpose of service of legal notice is to intimate the bonafide drawer that his cheque has been dishonoured and he can avoid prosecution by making payment but in case drawer wants to dispute his liability, then hardly makes any difference that whether he had received the legal notice or not\".Again there is no such pleading by complainant nor any evidence and this Court has drawn the conclusion that it is against the basic provisions of law and also settled law. In considered view of this Court, such findings are also not sustainable. Petition dismissed",

Details of the case:\n   - The lower appellate court held that the complaint itself is not maintainable, as accused No.1-company was impleaded through the Managing Director and nobody was named as Managing Director and therefore, no person on behalf of accused No.1-company could be convicted, as nobody is named as Managing Director.\n   - The lower appellate court also held that there is no evidence on record to show that accused No.2- Director was responsible for day to day business of accused No.1-Company.\n   - The lower appellate court further held that the documents Ex.C4 to Ex.C17 are photocopies and therefore, they are not admissible in evidence, as originals thereof were not produced on record.\n   - The lower appellate court also held that even the notice Ex.C6 itself is defective, as it is not mentioned that accused No.1-Company is served through an individual as it is only mentioned 'through its Managing Director'.\n   - The lower appellate court also held that even the address given in the notice is incomplete and there is no presumption that the notice was ever served.\n   - The lower appellate court further held that the complainant has failed to prove on record the authorization in his favour by the Board of Directors of the applicant- Corporation and no such documents has been exhibited on record to show that CW1 Ashok Kumar, who appeared on behalf of the complainant, was authorized person.\n   - The lower appellate court also held that without following the procedure as per Section 65 of Evidence Act, the photocopies of the documents, without production of originals thereof, mere exhibition of the documents, will not dispense with the mode of proof.\n\n5. Decision on the appeal:\n   - The High Court allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the trial court.\n   - The High Court acquitted the respondents and held that there is no criminal legal liability of accused-appellant and he has been wrongly held guilty.\n   - The High Court also observed that the lower appellate court has given findings which are against the law and such findings as returned in the judgment under appeal are not sustainable."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nCrl. L.P No. 4/2019 is an application under Section 378 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, CrPC), praying for special leave to appeal to the appellant to prefer appeal against the order dated 26.02.2019 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate- Ist Class, East Sikkim at Gangtok in Private Complaint Case No. 33 of 2018. Crl. L.P No. 5/2019 is a similar application filed under Section 378 (4) CrPC praying for special leave to appeal to the appellant to prefer appeal against the impugned order dated 26.02.2019 passed by learned Judicial Magistrate-1st Class, East Sikkim at Gangtok in Private Complaint Case No. 34 of  2. Both Private Complaint Case No. 33 of 2018 and Private Complaint Case No. 34 of 2018 are complaints filed by the appellant under Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short, N.I Act) against the present respondent.  Private Complaint Case No. 33 of 2018 was accompanied by an application under Section 142 (1) (b) of the N.I Act for condonation of delay of 39 days in preferring the connected complaint. Private Complaint Case No. 34 of 2018 was also similarly accompanied by an application for condonation of delay under Section 142 (1) (b) of the N.I. Act for condonation of delay of 78 days. Challenging the aforesaid orders dated 26.02.2019, Crl. L.P No. 4/2019 and Crl. L.P No. 5/2019 have been filed along with Memos of Appeal.  It is to be noted, at this juncture, that appeals have not been registered till now as the instant Crl. L.P No.04/2019 and Crl. L.P No.05/2019 are pending adjudication.  In both the Criminal Leave Petitions, the respondents have filed objections, contending, amongst others, that in absence of an order of acquittal passed by the learned Magistrate, no right of appeal is conferred by statute upon the appellant/complainant and therefore, the applications seeking leave to appeal are not maintainable.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n. Mr. Namka submits that since the learned Magistrate had dismissed the complaints, the same amounts to acquittal of the respondent and therefore, appeal under Section 378 (4) CrPC would be maintainable. In support of his submissions, learned Counsel has placed reliance on the following decisions: i. Vinod Kumar vs. State of Punjab, reported in 1999 SCC Online P and H 687. ii. Kalpana Tyagi vs. Sneh Lata Sharma, reported in 2003 CRI.L.J. 3395. iii. S. Rajaram vs. S. Seenivasan, reported in 2007(4) CTC 136. iv. Mander Singh and others vs. Ladi, reported in 2008 SCC Online P and H 482. v. Harvinder Singh vs. State of Punjab in Criminal Revision No.1275/2011 (Date of Decision: 28.01.2013). vi. Skyline constructions and Housing Pvt. Ltd vs. T.D Kumaravell Vasanthan, reported in MANU/ KA/2158/2017.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n Mr. Prasad, on the other hand, has submitted that a distinction has to be borne in mind with regard to complaint dismissed prior to the summoning of the accused and complaints dismissed subsequent to summoning of the accused. He has submitted that if a complaint is dismissed prior to the summoning of the accused, such an order of dismissal can be challenged only by way of a revision application and not by taking recourse to filing an appeal under Section 378 (4) CrPC. He submits that cases under N.I Act are tried by learned Magistrates following the procedure of trial in summons-cases and if the complaint is dismissed on the grounds mentioned in Section 256 CrPC, same will result in acquittal of the accused and in that event, an appeal will be maintainable. In support of his submissions, Mr. Prasad has also relied on Kalpana Tyagi (supra).\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe learned Magistrate had taken up the applications for condonation of delay for consideration at the first instance. Without issuing any notice to the respondent herein, after hearing the learned counsel for the appellant, the learned Magistrate had come to the conclusion that the appellant herein had not been able to show sufficient cause to allow the applications for condonation of delay and had, accordingly, rejected both the applications by separate orders dated 26.02.2019. Paragraph-8 of both the orders dated 26.02.2019, which is identical, reads as follows:- \"In view of the above and since the Complainant has not been able to show sufficient cause to allow condonation for her to file the instant complaint, the complaint fails and is dismissed accordingly.\"\n",
    "Case_Result": "9. I have heard Mr. Jorgay Namka, learned counsel for the appellant and Mr. Anmol Prasad, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent.12. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the materials on recordSection 378 (5) CrPC provides that no application under sub- section (4) for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal shall be entertained by the High Court after the expiry of six months, where the complainant is a public servant, and sixty days in every other case, computed from the date of the order of acquittal.Section 378 (6) CrPC provides that no appeal from that order of acquittal shall lie under sub-section 1 or sub-section 2 of Section 378 if, in any case, the application under sub-section (4) for the grant of special leave to appeal from an order of acquittal is refused.If the answer is in the affirmative, necessarily, an application for grant of leave to prefer appeal would be maintainable. 18. Before I proceed to deal with the question, it will be appropriate to take note of the decisions cited at the Bar.25. The facts before Karnataka High Court and the Madras High Court are similar to the facts of these two Criminal Leave Petitions. Perusal of the judgment of the Karnataka High Court, however, goes to show that the question with regard to maintainability of the appeal was not raised before the Court. Similarly, no issue was raised before Madras High Court that Criminal Revision Petition was not maintainable and that in such circumstances, only an appeal will be maintainable.. Chapter XX relating to trial of summons-cases by Magistrate provides for either conviction or acquittal of an accused. Section 255 CrPC provides that if the Magistrate, upon taking the evidence referred to in section 254 and such further evidence, if any, as he may, of his own motion, cause to be produced, finds the accused not guilty, he shall record an order of acquittal. Section 255 (2) CrPC provides that where the Magistrate does not proceed in accordance with the provisions of Section 325 or Section 360, he shall, if he finds the accused guilty, pass sentence upon him according to law. Charge is not required to be framed in summons-cases and therefore, use of the word discharge in trial of summons-cases is really a misnomer. It was in that context Punjab and Haryana High Court had held that discharge means acquittal of the accused. However, in the present cases, there is no order of discharge.. Section 256 CrPC provides for acquittal of the accused on entirely different grounds. Section 256 (1) CrPC provides that if the summons has been issued on complaint, and on the day appointed for the appearance of the accused, or any day subsequent thereto to which the hearing may be adjourned, the complainant does not appear, the Magistrate shall, notwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, acquit the accused, unless for some reason he thinks it proper to adjourn the hearing of the case to some other day. Section 256 (2) CrPC provides that, so far as may be, provisions of sub-section (1) shall also apply to cases where non-appearance of the complainant is due to his death. It will be necessary to also consider the provision contained in Section 203 CrPC which provides that if, after considering the statements on oath (if any) of the complainant and of the witnesses and the result of the enquiry or investigation (if any) under Section 202, the Magistrate is of the opinion that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding, he shall dismiss the complaint, and in every such case he shall briefly record his reasons for so doing. Issue of process, namely, a summons in a summons-case or a warrant in a warrant-case under Section 204 CrPC, arises only if the Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding.t is no longer res integra that an order of dismissal of first complaint under Section 203 CrPC is no bar for the entertainment of a second complaint on the same facts but it can be entertained only in exceptional circumstances such as where the previous order was passed on incomplete record, or on a misunderstanding of the nature of the complaint or where new facts which could not, with reasonable diligence, have been brought on record in the previous proceeding. The fact that a second complaint can be entertained on same facts, albeit in exceptional circumstances, after dismissal of a complaint under Section 203 CrPC, demonstrates that dismissal of a complaint at every stage does not automatically result in acquittal of the accused because if the accused is acquitted, such acquittal can be questioned only by taking recourse to Section 378 (4) CrPC. As noticed earlier, dismissal of a complaint under Section 203 CrPC is at a stage prior to issuance of process.30. Section 142 (1) of N.I Act provides that cognizance of any offence punishable under Section 138 shall not be taken by any Court unless conditions set out in Section 142 (1) (a) and (b) are satisfied. The word 'cognizance' is neither defined in the N.I Act nor in CrPC. Petition dismissed",

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case is whether the appeal by the appellant against the orders of the Magistrate dismissing the complaints under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (N.I. Act) is maintainable. The lower court dismissed the complaints on the ground that the appellant failed to show sufficient cause for condonation of delay in filing the complaints.\n\nIn the given arguments, the respondent's counsel has rightly distinguished between a complaint dismissed prior to the summoning of the accused and complaints dismissed subsequent to summoning of the accused. If a complaint is dismissed prior to the summoning of the accused, such an order of dismissal can be challenged only by way of a revision application and not by taking recourse to filing an appeal under Section 378 (4) CrPC. However, the respondent's counsel has overlooked the fact that if the complaint is dismissed subsequent to summoning of the accused on the grounds mentioned in Section 256 CrPC, the same will result in acquittal of the accused and in that event, an appeal will be maintainable.\n\nThe arguments and evidence presented by the appellant clearly indicate that the complaints were filed after the expiry of the limitation period, and the appellant has filed applications for condonation of delay. The lower court has dismissed the complaints without issuing any notice to the respondent and without considering the applications for condonation of delay. This action of the lower court is contrary to the provisions of Section 200 CrPC and the principles of natural justice.\n\nIn the absence of an order of acquittal passed by the Magistrate, no right of appeal is conferred by statute upon the appellant/complainant. However, in the instant case, the lower court has dismissed the complaints on the ground that the appellant failed to show sufficient cause for condonation of delay in filing the complaints. This dismissal by the lower court amounts to an order of acquittal of the respondent, and therefore, the appeal under Section 378 (4) CrPC is maintainable.\n\nIn view of the above analysis, the appeal should be allowed, and the orders of the lower court dismissing the complaints are set aside. The applications for condonation of delay are admitted, and the Magistrate shall proceed with the complaints in accordance with law.\n\nIn conclusion, the appeal is allowed, and the orders of the lower court are set aside."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n This application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 has been filed to quash the entire proceeding of Complaint Case No. 1008 of 2012 (Old No.1371 of 2007) Vinod Kumar Vs. Alok Verma, pending in the court of Special Judicial Magistrate, Haridwar under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred as, \"the Act, 1881) as well as summoning order dated 16.01.2013 along with the order passed by the learned 1st Additional Sessions Judge, Haridwar dated 28.06.2014, passed in Criminal Revision No. 136 of 2013, preferred against the order dated 16.01.2013, whereby the revision of the present applicant had also been rejected. Facts, to the limited extent necessary are that the respondent gave Rs. 8.75 Lakhs on 11.03.2007, as debt, to the present applicant on the assurance that the money shall be returned exactly after one month. The same was not returned as promised but a cheque No.144194 to the tune of Rs. 8.75 Lakhs was issued by the present applicant, which he drew from his bank account of Punjab National Bank, Jwalapur, District Haridwar. The said cheque was submitted by the respondent for collection, however, the bank had returned the same with endorsement that \"account was closed\". In the memo of the bank, it was also mentioned that the cheque was also returned because it exceeded the arrangement. The respondent sent a notice under Section 138(b) of the Act, 1881 on 17.04.2007, which was presumed served upon the present applicant but payment was not made to the respondent. Therefore, the respondent filed the complaint on 09.05.2007. The present applicant challenged the said cognizance order dated 16.05.2007, through Criminal Misc. Application No.669 of 2007, Alok Verma Vs. State of Uttarakhand and another, on the ground that the respondent-complainant examined his power of attorney holder under Section 200 of Cr.P.C.  Thereafter, the respondent-complainant filed his affidavit under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. After considering the matter afresh, the learned Magistrate passed the order on 16.01.2013, whereby the present applicant-accused was summoned under Section 138 of the Act, 1881. Against this summoning order, the present applicant preferred a criminal revision.  Hence, the present application has been filed.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nMr. Rakesh Thapliyal, the learned Senior Counsel submits that the summoning order had been passed without applying the judicial mind; the Magistrate was bound to consider the essential ingredient of Section 138 of the Act, 1881 whether there was a legally enforceable debt; in 2006, the present applicant became a member of a Committee and for becoming a member of the said Committee he had given two undated blank cheques to the respondent-complainant; the present applicant continued to become member for ten months and then he left the Committee as he was having some doubt with regard to functioning of that Committee and then he requested the complainant to return back the said two blank cheques, given to him, but he refused and told that the cheques were missing; as both the applicant and the complainant run their shops since long back in Jwalapur, the applicant was in this impression that the said cheques were missing; the applicant never made any attempt or efforts to take any legal recourse against the complainant to get back the blank cheques; but, the complainant sent a notice to the applicant with the statement that on 11.03.2007, a sum of Rs. 8.75 Lakhs were paid in cash to the present applicant as loan with this assurance that he will refund the amount within a period of one month but instead of paying that amount on 11.04.2007, cheque of an amount of Rs. 8.75 Lakhs of Punjab National Bank, Jwalapur, District Haridwar, bearing cheque No.144194, was given and the said cheque was presented in the concerned bank, but the bank intimated that the account was closed; thereafter, the respondent-complainant filed the said complaint; since the said amount of Rs. 8.75 Lakhs was given in cash as alleged by the respondent-complainant in the complaint, therefore, in the light of the provisions of Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred as, \"the Act, 1961\"), the impugned summoning order dated 16.01.2013 is bad in law. Mr. Rakesh Thapliyal, learned Senior Counsel submits that since the amount of Rs. 8.75 Lakhs was given in cash as alleged by the respondent in the complaint, therefore, in the light of the provisions of Section 269SS of the Act, 1961, the impugned summoning order dated 16.01.2013 is bad in law.   Mr. Rakesh Thapliyal, learned Senior Counsel argued that the allegations in the complaint are totally false.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nhe learned counsel appearing for the respondent submits that a loan transaction which is in violation of Section 269SS of the Act, 1961 would not be void, however, the penalty is provided under Section 271D of the Act, 1961 against the breach of Section 269SS of the Act, 1961.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n3. The Special Judicial Magistrate, Haridwar, in that Complaint Case No. 1371 of 2007 titled as Vinod Kumar Vs. Alok Verma, took the cognizance on 16.05.2007 for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act, 1881.  This High Court decided the said Criminal Misc. Application on 16.04.2012, whereby the cognizance order was set aside with the direction to the learned Magistrate to proceed with the complaint after recording the statement of the complainant and pass appropriate orders.  The learned Additional Sessions Judge decided the same on 28.06.2014, whereby the revision had been rejected. \n",
    "Case_Result": "Heard Mr. Rakesh Thapliyal, learned Senior Counsel assisted by Ms. Neeti Rana, learned counsel for the applicant and Mr. Gaurav Singh, learned counsel for the respondent, perused and gone through the record.However, the said plea was not taken by the applicant in the earlier criminal misc. application filed by him and there is no explanation from the applicant as to why this plea was not taken in the earlier application.Chapter XXB of the Act, 1961 provides for requirement as to mode of acceptance, payment or repayment in certain cases to counteract evasion of tax. Section 269SS of the Act, 1961 was inserted by the Finance Act, 1984.. In the light of the facts of the present case, the object of the parties when the transaction was entered into cannot be said to be to circumvent or defeat the purpose of the Act, 1961. Section 269SS of the Act, 1961 mandates no person, after the cut of date i.e. 30th day of June, 1984, shall take or accept from any other person any loan or deposit otherwise than by an account payee cheque or an account payee bank draft if the amount was more than Rs. 20,000/-. Breach of the provisions of Section 269SS of the Act, 1961 provides penalty to which a person would be subjected to under Section 271D of the Act, 1961. Section 271D does not provide that such transaction would be null and void.Breach of Section 269SS of the Act, 1961 provides that the penalty to which the person would be subjected to under Section 271D of the Act, 1961. Section 271D does not provide that such a transaction would be null and void. There is no provision under the Act, 1881 which would vitiate the entire loan transaction for dealing with cash amount above Rs. 20,000/-. The culpability of offence under Section 138 of the Act, 1881 will not freeze for the reason of violation of Section 269SS of the Act, 1961 and nothing prevents the operation of the statutory presumption under Section 118 and Section 139 of the Act, 1881. The applicant could not show any statutory provisions under the Act, 1961 or any other law which stipulates that a loan transaction which is in violation of Section 269SS of the Act, 1961, would be void. Violation of Section 269SS of the Act, 1961 would not render the loan as not recoverable through a legal process. The payer of the money in cash in violation of Section 269SS of the Act, 1961 would, therefore, be entitled to enforce an agreement of advancement of money in cash beyond Rs. 20,000/-. Under Section 139 of the Act, 1881, there is a presumption in favour of the holder. Section 139 of the Act, 1881, stipulates that it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque, of the nature referred to in Section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. It is also well settled that at the time of the consideration of the case for summoning, the merit of the case cannot be tested. In the case at hand, the respondent-complainant has proved prima facie the basic ingredients of the offence under Section 138 of the Act, 1881.. As so far as the contentions of the applicant are concerned on the facts of this case, the applicant can raise disputed question of facts before the learned trial court. Application dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 636a3907256c9ffed8242bfe\n**Facts**: This is an application for special leave to appeal against the order of acquittal passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Court No.3 at Nashik on 20/1/2007 in R.C.C. No. 18 of 2006 filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'the Act')- The said complaint was filed on account of dishonour of Cheque No. 167547 dated 25/4/2005 and in the sum of Rs.48, 01, 029/- drawn over the Punjab National Bank. The statutory demand notice was issued on 23/11/2005 and it was received by the accused on 25/11/2005 and as the accused failed to pay the amount of the dishonoured cheque within 15 days, the complaint came to be filed. The complainant had filed affidavit for examination-in-chief at Exh, 18 and he was subjected to cross-examination by the learned Advocate of the accused. The dishonoured cheque was at Exh.22 and the memos of the respective banks was at Exhs.25 and 44, whereas the statutory notice was at Exh.26 and the acknowledgement receipts were at Exhs.27(1) to 27(4), The reply to the statutory notice was given on 7/12/2005 at Exh.28.  On examination of the oral and documentary evidence, the trial court noted that the cheque at Exh.25 was dated 25/4/2005, drawn by the accused in favour of the complainant and the complainant had deposited the same for the first time on 25/10/2005 and, thus, after the expiry of the period of six months. Witness No.2 was Mr. Bhalchandra Panabh Inamdar, an employee of the Rupee Co-op. Bank where the complainant had deposited the cheque, whereas Witness No.3 was Mr. Anant Vinayak Ganvire, an employee of the Punjab National Bank. He had brought on record the statement of the acgpunt of the Dream Constructions at Exh.47 W01 ALL MR (Cri) - Dec. and the register of cheque return at Exh.48. Witness No.2 Bhalchandra Inamdar admitted in his cross-examination that the subject cheque was sent for clearing by his Bank on 25/10/ 2005 and Witness No.3 Anant Ganvire admitted, during his cross-examination, that on 25/10/ 2005 the said cheque was outdated or stale and it did not remain a negotiable instrument, though he admitted that the cheque was dishonoured with remarks \"insufficient funds  It clearly mean that it was presented beyond the period of its validity and the complainant failed to produce any evidence showing that the cheque was presented in the drawee bank within the validity period of six months. The complaint came to be dismissed mainly on this ground.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The trial court refened to the provisions of Section 138 of the Act and it observed that the cheque was required to be presented within six months from the date on which it was drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever was earlier and the period of six months shall be calculated from the date appearing on the cheque and held that the cheque dated 25/4/2005 should have been presented to the drawer bank on or before 25/ 10/2005\n**Argument by Petitioner**: 3. Mr. Kumbhakoni the learned counsel for the applicant - original complainant urged before me that the period of validity of six months in respect of a cheque must be counted from the next day i.e. if the cheque was dated 25/4/2005, the period of six months ought to be counted from 26/4/2005 and if so counted, the receipt of the cheque by the drawee bank on 25/10/2005 was within the validity period of six months.  He referred to the provisions of Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and submitted that the commencement of the validity period ought to be counted by excluding the first day i.e. 25/4/ 2005.   It was contended by Mr. Kumbhakoni that the day of the cause of action has to be excluded for counting of period of six months and in the instant case the day of cause of action ought to be treated as 25/4/ 2005 and the same has to be excluded, meaning thereby that the period of six months of the validity of the cheque ought to be counted from 26/4/2005 and if so counted, deposit of the cheque with the drawee bank on 25/10/2005 would be within the validity period of six months. As per Mr. Kumbhakoni this analogy is squarely applicable to a cheque which was dishonoured or held to have been submitted beyond the validity period of six months.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Mr. Thorat, the learned Senior Counsel, on the other hand, has supported the view taken by the trial court.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: . Heard the learned counsel for the respective parties 6. As held by the Apex Court in the case of Anil Kumar Sawhney (Supra) and Shri Ishar Alloy Steels Ltd, [2001 ALL MR (Cri) 578 (S.C.)] (Supra), an offence to be made out under the substantive provisions of Section 138 of the Act, it is mandatory that the cheque is presented to \"the bank\" within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier.  It is the cheque drawn which has to be presented to \"the bank\" within the period specified therein. When a post-dated cheque is written or drawn, it is only a bill of exchange and as such provision of Section 138(a) are not applicable to the said instrument. The postdated cheque becomes a cheque under the Act on the date which is written on the said cheque and the six months' period has to be reckoned, for the purposes of Section 138 (a) of the Act, from the said date. Section 138 of the Act creates an offence and the law relating to the penal provisions has to be interpreted strictly so that no-one can ingeniously or insidiously or guilefully or strategically be prosecuted.  Though the cheque issued can be encashed i.e. it can be treated as negotiable instrument on the date inscribed on it, that, however, does not mean that the cheque is always to be presented to the drawer's bank on the day it is issued. The payee of the cheque has the option to present the cheque in any bank including the collecting bank where he has his account but to attract the criminal liability of the drawer of the cheque such collecting bank is obliged to present the cheque in the drawee or payee bank on which the cheque is drawn within the period of six months from the date on which it is shown to have been issued This observation made by a three Judge bench in Shri Ishar Alloy Steels Ltd. clearly re-affirms that the period of six months has to be counted from the date which is inscribed on it. In the instant case, if the cheque was dated 25/4/2005, undoubtedly the payee could have encashed the same on the very same day, if it was presented during the banking hours and, therefore, there is no justification in claiming that the first of the dates or the date written on the cheque was required to be excluded for counting the period of six months. In defence of this, Mr. Kumbhakoni submitted that the cheque could be issued in the night or after the banking hours and, therefore, it could be impossible to encash it on the date which is inscribed on it. Undoubtedly such a case or defence was not made out before the trial court by the complainant and, therefore, this hypothetical submission cannot support the claim that the period of six months ought to have been counted from 26/4/2005, in the instant case. In the case of Ashok Badave (Supra), the question that fell for consideration before a three Judge bench was, \"whether period of six months for presentation of cheque to the banker, as required under proviso (a) to Section 138 of the Act should be reckoned from the date mentioned on the face of the cheque or a date previous to that when it was made over by the drawer to the drawee\".\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The case before the court involves a dispute between Vinod Kumar and Alok Verma based on a cheque bounced for Rs. 8.75 lakhs. The lower court took cognizance of the complaint filed by Vinod Kumar under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The applicant, Alok Verma, challenged the cognizance order through a criminal revision, which was rejected by the Additional Sessions Judge. The present application under Section 482 of the CrPC seeks to quash the entire proceeding of Complaint Case No. 1008 of 2012. \n\nThe applicant argues that the summoning order had been passed without applying the judicial mind and that the essential ingredient of Section 138 of the Act, 1881, i.e., the existence of a legally enforceable debt, was not considered. The applicant also contends that since the amount of Rs. 8.75 lakhs was given in cash as alleged by the respondent in the complaint, the impugned summoning order dated 16.01.2013 is bad in law due to the provisions of Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act, 1961. \n\nOn the other hand, the respondent argues that a loan transaction which is in violation of Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act, 1961 would not be void, however, the penalty is provided under Section 271D of the Income Tax Act, 1961 against the breach of Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act, 1961. \n\nUpon examination of the case, it is clear that the lower court's decision to reject the applicant's criminal revision is correct. The arguments and evidence presented do not warrant quashing the entire proceeding of Complaint Case No. 1008 of 2012. The bounced cheque for Rs. 8.75 lakhs, as alleged by the respondent, creates a presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, that the amount represented by the cheque is a legally enforceable debt or liability. The fact that the amount was given in cash does not affect the validity of the presumption created under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The provisions of Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act, 1961 do not apply to this case as the loan transaction does not involve any public sector company or a government company. Therefore, the applicant's contentions that the summoning order is bad in law are not tenable. \n\nIn conclusion, the appeal should be dismissed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nHeard Sri Ashok Kumar Singh along with Sri Mohd. Isa Khan, learned counsel for applicant, Sri Vimal Kumar and Km.Vishwa Mohini, learned counsel for opposite party nos.2 and 3 and Smt.Kiran Singh, learned Additional Goverment Advocate and perused the record. By filing this petition, the petitioner has challenged the order dated 01.03.2021, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.1, Lucknow in CNR No.UPLKO10135822020, Criminal Revision No.213/2020 (Mohd.Yahya Farooqui v. Asif Ali Ahmad Siddiqui and another) and the order dated 11.11.2020, passed by the Additional Court, Room No.5, Lucknow, under Section 143-A of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, P.S. Ghazipur, Distr4ict Lucknow, Complaint No.6964 of 2019 (Asif Ali Ahmad Siddiqui and another v. Mohd.Yahya Farooqui) and for quashing the whole proceedings of the above criminal case. Petitioner (opposite party) Mohd.Yahya Farooqui @ Firoz Farooqui and complainant no.2 (opposite party no.3) are real brother and sister and Complainant no.3 is a class III Government Employee. Brief facts giving rise to this litigation are that opposite party nos.2 and 3 had instituted a Complaint Case under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, against the petitioner alleging therein that in the year 2017-18, opposite party (petitioner) and his brother Javed Farooqui had taken a loan of Rs.12 lacs from complainant nos.1 and 2 on the condition that they will return Rs. 2 lacs with 10% interest by 31.03.2018 2 and on remaining 10 lacs they will pay Rs.5 lacs as interest by June 30, 2018.  The aforesaid amount, according to the complainants, was paid in parts through RTGS and NEFT in petitioner's bank account. Thereafter Rs.3,55,000/- were stated to have been given to the petitioner by the complainants in the month of November, 2017 and complainant no.2 also stated to have given 18 Tolas of jewellary to the petitioner for the purpose of obtaining loan by mortgaging the same. It is further stated in the complaint that a loan of Rs.6.25 lacs was taken by complainant no.1 as personal loan from the bank and he lended that amount also to the petitioner and his brother Javed Farooqui. As complainants/opposite party nos.2 and 3 had themselves came into financial crisis, they started demanding their money back from the petitioner and as a final settlement the petitioner and his brother Javed Farooqui provided a cheque bearing no.494041 dated 19.6.2019 of Rs. 30 lacs, drawn on Indian Overseas Bank to the complainants.  The cheque was presented in State Bank of India, Indira Nagar Branch, Lucknow on 4.7.2019 and the same was dishonoured for the reason \"payment stopped by drawer\". A demand notice was stated to have been sent to the petitioner through Speed Post on 23.07.2019 and a copy of the same was also sent to the petitioner on his e-mail ID as well as on WhatsApp No.8800367938, however the notice was returned back unserved. When the demand was not made within 15 days i.e. till 7.8.2019, the complainants have filed this complainant and vide order dated 5.10.2019 the petitioner was summoned to face trial.  Petitioner appeared before the trial court and obtained bail. His statement under Section 251 Cr.P.C. was recorded on 3.2.2020 wherein the petitioner had denied to have given any cheque to the complainants in discharge of any financial liability, however he accepted that the cheque in question was bearing his signatures, however the same was missing.  Both these orders have been challenged by the petitioner by moving this petition.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel for the petitioner while referring to the order of the trial court as well as of the revisional court submits that the complaint was filed on the basis of false and fabricated facts as no money was invested by the complainants either by cash, demand draft or by cheque and Rs.18,18,340/- were transferred in the bank account of the petitioner by the complainants for the purpose of investment in the business of brick kiln and the petitioner as per the agreed oral terms had returned about Rs.3,35,300/- to the complainants.  It is further submitted that in fact petitioner had lost his three cheques bearing nos.494041,494042 and 494043 and an application in this regard was submitted to the Manager, Indian Overseas Bank, Civil Lines, Allahabad on 26.04.2019 and he was also requested to stop the payment of these cheques.  He further submits that on the same day i.e. 26.4.2019, the petitioner had also informed the Station House Officer, Shivkuti, Allahabad, informing that the above mentioned cheques, which were blank except his signatures, had gone missing. According to him the business of brick kiln failed and he came under financial constraints, however he had not taken any loan of Rs. 41 lacs from the complainants.  It is further submitted that as the cheques were not issued in discharge of any legally enforceable liability, the proceedings under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, are not maintainable as well as there is no relation of debtor and creditor between the complainants and the petitioner and mandatory provision of Section 251 Cr.P.C. has also not been complied by the trial court and no cause of action as required under Section 143 of Negotiable Instruments Act has occurred. Complainants are not the bearer of cheque no.494041, dated 19.6.2019 of the value of Rs. 30 lacs and also that the complaint has not been filed within one 4 month after the passage of 15 days of giving notice as provided under Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. It is also submitted that service by Whats App or e-mail is not recognized under any law and the trial court as well as the revisional court has not considered the grounds put forth by the petitioner in right perspective and has passed the orders in utter disregard to the settled law and, therefore, both the orders passed by the trial court as well as the revisional court are liable to be set aside along with the complaint. Learned counsel for petitioner has relied on following case laws : (i) Sadanandan Bhadran vs. Madhavan Sunil Kumar AIR 1998 SC 3043 : (AIR 1998 SC 3043) (Para 10) (ii) Yogendra Pratap Singh vs. Savitri Pandey and another AIR 2015 SC 157 : (AIR 2015 SC 157) (Paras 31, 36 and 37) (iii) Anvar P.V.

Hegde AIR 2008 SC 1325 : (AIR 2008 SC 1325) (Para 34) Learned counsel for opposite party nos.2 and 3 has relied on following case laws : (i) Girish Kumar Suneja v. C.B.I. 2017 Cri.L.J.4980 : (AIR 2017 SC 3620) (Paras 15,16,17 and 18) (ii) Goli Satyanarayana Reddy v. G.

Learned Counsel for petitioner with regard to the order passed by the Courts below under section 143A Negotiable Instrument Act has not brought any other ground which may find favour of this Court.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n Learned counsel for opposite party nos. 2 and 3 submits that once the cheque has been issued by the petitioner, there is a presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act that the same has been issued in discharge of legally enforceable liability and, therefore, once the petitioner has admitted his signatures on the impugned cheques, he could not confront his liability to pay. t is also submitted that the notice of demand was given as required under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and within limitation the complaint was filed and therefore no illegality has been committed 5 either by the trial court or by the revisional court as the petitioner had admitted his signatures on the cheques.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n7. During the course of trial, an application under Section 143A of Negotiable Instruments Act was moved by complainants and trial court by passing impugned order dated 11.11.2020 directed the petitioner to pay 3 Rs. 6 lacs i.e. (20% of the cheque amount) within 60 days to the complainants. A revision was preferred against this order and the same was also dismissed by the revisional court vide impugned order dated 01.03.2021\n",
    "Case_Result": "Having heard learned counsel parties and having perused the record, it is fruitful to have a glance on the relevant provisions of Negotiable Instruments Act, which appears necessary for the disposal of this petition. Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act reads as under Under Section 138 of the Act, where a cheque is issued by the drawer in the discharge of any debt or any other liability is returned by the bank unpaid, because the amount standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque,the said person is deemed to have committed an offence, subject to proviso to Section 138 which provides that the cheque should have been presented to the bank within the period of six months from the date of which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier. The payee must also make a demand for the payment of the said amount by giving a notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque within 30 days of the receipt of the information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque unpaid. If despite this demand, the drawer fails to make the payment within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice, a cause of action arises for prosecuting him for the offence 7 punishable under Section 138 of the Act. Section 142 provides that the court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act upon receipt of a complaint in writing made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque. Such complaint must be made within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under Clause (c) of the proviso to Section 138However, discretion is given to the court to take cognizance of the complaint even after the prescribed period, if the complainant satisfies the court that he had sufficient cause for not making the complaint within such period.It is not disputed that the drawer of the cheque makes himself liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Act if he fails to make the payment within fifteen days of the receipt of the notice given by the drawee. His failure to make the payment within the stipulated period gives rise to a cause of action to the complainant to prosecute the drawer under Section 138 of the Act. Perusal of record in the background of the submissions of learned counsel for parties would reveal that according to the avertments contained in the complaint the impugned cheque was presented by the complainants in their bank i.e. State Bank of India, Indira Nagar, Lucknow on 4.7.2019 and the same was dishonoured on 5.7.2019 . Notice of demand was issued on 23.07.2019 through registered post as well as through e-mail and Whats App, however the notice given through the registered post was received back unserved on 29.07.2019 and according to the complainants, the cause of action had accrued on 7.8.2019 and the complaint was filed on 17.8.2019.Having regard to the conditions which are required to be fulfilled before summoning any person to face the trial with regard to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, prima facie it appears that those requirements/conditions have apparently been fulfilled.So far as the submissions of learned counsel for petitioner with regard to the non compliance of Section 251, Cr.P.C. is concerned, perusal of the record would reveal that the statement of the petitioner has been 8 recorded by the trial court and sufficient information pertaining to the accusation, which has been leveled against the petitioner, has been communicated to him by the trial court and the petitioner has categorically replied that the signatures on the impugned cheque is of him, however the cheque had gone missing and the same had not been issued in discharge of any legally enforceable liability and also that he had not received any notice.This statement of the petitioner was recorded on 3.2.2020 and a copy of the same has been filed by the petitioner himself at page no.79 of the paper book of this petition, thefore, having regard to the substance of accusation which has been communicated to the petitioner by the trial court, in the considered opinion of this Court, sufficient compliance of Section 251, Cr.P.C. has been made and proper and sufficient opportunity to explain the accusation has been given to the petitioner by the trial court.. It is also submitted by Ld. Counsel for the petitioner that a Government Servant could not lend or invest any amount in any business. I need not to dwell deep in this submission for the reason that violation of any service conduct rules of any employment may be a relevant fact for initiating any disciplinary inquiry against the Government Servant but the same could not adversely effect his right to receive any legally enforceable amount or debt and therefore even if the money has been given by complainant no.2 to the petitioner in violation of any service conduct rules the same could not be a ground to quash the proceedings of instant case. The another leg of submission of learned counsel for petitioner is with regard to the fact that the cheque was not issued in discharge of any legally enforceable liability and the same was missing. What is emerging from the material on record is that the signature of the accused on the said cheque are not disputed by the petitioner. The petitioner has also not disputed that there were transactions between the parties. Even as per the statement of the accused, which was recorded at the stage of 251 Cr.P.C. he has admitted that signatures on the impugned cheque was of him. Therefore, once the petitioner/accused has admitted that the cheque bears his signature, there is presumption that there exists a legally enforceable debt or liability under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. However, such a presumption is rebuttable in nature and the accused is required to lead the evidence to rebut such presumption. Coming back to the facts in the present case and considering that the petitioner has admitted his signatures on the cheque in question and that even according to the petitioner some amount was due and payable, there is a presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act that there exists a legally enforceable debt or liability. Of course such presumption is rebuttable in nature and the same could only be done by adducing evidence at trial but at this stage as the minute appreciation of evidence is not to be done complaint could not be quashed on this score.Therefore at this stage of trial complainants are entitled for the presumption as provided under Section 139 of N. I. ActNow I have to deal the submission of Ld. Counsel for the petitioner with regard to non service of the notice on him and also that consequently the complaint has been filed without accruing of cause of action.It has been stated by the complainants in complaint that the cheque was presented in the Bank on 4.7.2019 and the same was dishonoured for the reason \"payment stopped by drawer\". A demand notice was sent to the petitioner through Speed Post on 23.07.2019 and a copy of the same was also sent to the petitioner on his e-mail ID as well as on his WhatsApp No.8800367938, however the notice sent by post was returned back unserved and when the demand was not made within 15 days i.e. till 7.8.2019, the complainants have filed this complainant.Having regard to the fact that the signatures of the petitioner on the cheque has been accepted by him and the cause of action has accrued after 01.09.2018 (the day from which Section 143A had come into effect) and at this stage minute scrutiny of the evidence is neither desirable nor required and also the ytrial Court while directing to pay amount under 17 143A N.I.Act has directed there appears no illegality in the orders of the Courts below.

[  Brief facts of the case are that the respondent filed a criminal complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against M/s D.S.G. Papers Pvt. Ltd. through its Director and authorized signatory Manoj Kumar, Manoj Kumar son of Suraj Bhan Gupta, Director M/ s DSG Papers Pvt. Ltd and Neeru Gupta (petitioner). Complainant/respondent has pleaded that presently, he is living in U.S.A. Complaint has been filed through his brother Sanjay Dhawan as Special Power of Attorney. Complainant has pleaded that accused No.2 i.e. Manoj Kumar was having family relations with the family of the complainant. The accused were running the firm in the name and style of D.S.G. Papers Pvt. Limited and the accused allured the complainant and his family members to invest money in the business of the aforesaid firm and they assured 20% shares to the complainant and his family members The complainant believed the accused and invested an amount of Rs.33,70,000/- in the firm of the accused. The amount was transferred from complainant's ICICI Bank NRI Account to the account of the accused. The accused allotted 3,09,250 shares of the company in favour of the complainant. Some shares were allotted to brother, father and sister-in-law of the complainant as per their investment. After some time, the accused demanded more money from the family of the complainant. Family members of the complainant were not in a position to pay the amount to the accused. For this reason, the accused asked the father of the complainant to mortgage his house and stood as personal guarantee to secure loan for his company. Due to good relations with the accused and allurement given by the accused, the father of the complainant has mortgaged his house No.7L, Green View, Rajbaha Road, Patiala and stood as personal guarantee to raise funds for the company of the accused. In the year 2012, the accused again contacted the brother of the complainant and asked him to bring the company out of financial crunch.  The accused asked for money, but the complainant showed his inability. Due to persistence and the assurance given by the accused that the amount will be the loan towards the company and the reasonable interest will be paid thereupon, the complainant transferred an amount of Rs.1,04,50,000/- on 14.09.2012 and 15.09.2012 to the company of the accused. It came to the knowledge of the complainant that the accused have allotted 55,000 shares at the rate of Rs.100/- each in the name of the complainant, whereas complainant never asked for the same, rather the amount was a loan towards the company.  ara No.7 of the complaint reads as under:-\\n\"7. That later on when complainant asked accused to return the amount then accused demanded that the shares in the name of the complainant and his family members should be transferred in accused No.2 and accused No.3's name and accused paid Rs.83,77,140/- to complainant and in discharge of his legal debt liability accused issue cheque No.861414 dated 01.10.2016 of ICICI Bank Branch Chhoti Baradari, Patiala for sum of Rs.2,43,73,000/- in favour of complainant as part payment of legally enforceable debt outstanding towards accused persons. At the time of issuing the above said cheque, you assured complainant that the cheque will be honoured as and when the same will be presented for encashment. The cheque on presentation was dishonoured with the remarks of 'insufficiency of funds'. Thereafter, the complainant contacted the accused, but the accused refused to pay the loan amount. The complainant filed an application before IG, NRI Wing, SAS Nagar, Mohali. The accused contacted the complainant and requested for some time with a promise that he will deposit the amount for the clearance of the cheque. Complainant believing the accused granted him further time. In the month of December, the accused again contacted the complainant and asked him to present the cheque for encashment with an assurance that the cheque will be honoured as and when presented for encashment. The complainant again presented the cheque through his brother and power of attorney holder with his bankers i.e. HDFC Bank Patiala, but the cheque was again dishonoured vide memo dated 13.12.2016. The complainant again contacted the accused, but the accused flatly refused to return the amount of cheque. Finding no alternative, the complainant had to initiate legal proceedings. The complainant pleaded in para No.17 of the complaint in the following manner:-\\n\\n\"17. That by means of aforesaid act, the accused has rendered themselves liable to be prosecuted under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as amended.\" Bare perusal of the aforesaid complaint would show that the complainant has not pleaded that the petitioner is incharge and responsible for day to day conduct of the business of the company. Perusal of the aforesaid order dated 31.01.2017 passed by the trial Court would show that the order of summoning is not related to offence under Section 141(2) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is relatable to signatory of the cheque only. The cheque in question was signed by Manoj Kumar as authorized signatory Para No.17 of the said judgment is relevant to be quoted hereasunder:-\\n\\n\"17. There is no dispute that the appellant, who was wife of the Managing Director, was appointed as a Director of the Company-M/S Elite International Pvt. Ltd. on 1st July, 2004 and had also executed a Letter of Guarantee on 19th January, 2005. The cheques in question were issued during April, 2008 to September, 2008. So far as the dishonor of Cheques is concerned, admittedly the cheques were not signed by the appellant. There is also no dispute that the appellant was not the Managing Director but only a non- executive Director of the Company. Non-executive Director is no doubt a custodian of the governance of the Company but does not involve in the day-to-day affairs of the running of its business and only monitors the executive activity. To fasten vicarious liability under Section 141 of the Act on a person, at the material time that person shall have been at the helm of affairs of the Company, one who actively looks after the day-to-day activities of the Company and particularly responsible for the conduct of its business. Simply because a person is a Director of a Company, does not make him liable under the N.I. Act. Every person connected with the Company will not fall into the ambit of the provision. Time and again, it has been asserted by this Court that only those persons who were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company at the time of commission of an offence will be liable for criminal action. A Director, who was not in charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company at the relevant time, will not be liable for an offence under Section 141 of the N.I. Act. In National Small Industries Corporation (supra) this Court observed:\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: . Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Patiala vide order dated 31.01.2017, summoned the accused to face trial under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: The complainant has further alleged that by way of inducement, the accused had committed the offence of cheating. Due to aforesaid inducement, the complainant has to part with the property i.e. Rs.2,43,73,000/- and the accused have dishonestly misappropriated the same. After receiving the dishonoured cheque from the banker, the complainant got served legal notice dated 30.12.2016 through his counsel upon all the accused. The accused did not pay the amount even after receipt of legal notice.  Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the cheque in question was not signed by the petitioner and the complaint is silent about the status of the petitioner. The complainant has not pleaded that the petitioner is incharge and responsible for day to day conduct of the business of the company. The petitioner could not have been summoned under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act simplicitor as she is not signatory of the cheque. The complaint in question does not disclose any overt-act on behalf of the petitioner.  The record would indicate that neither in the complaint, nor in the summoning order, any reference has been made to Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act by virtue of which,vicarious liability has been put in place. Petitioner is a lady and she has been implicated solely because she is wife of Manoj Kumar (signatory of the cheque). It would be apposite to mention that a person can be arrayed as accused under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act for advancing vicarious liability of such person.  It is incumbent upon the complainant to aver/plead that the accused was incharge and controller of the company at any point of time. No such averments have been made which are mandatory in nature before invoking provisions of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Petitioner being a lady has no role to play with the day to day affairs of the company. Complainant has preferred not to make any such averment in the complaint and therefore, mandatory requirement in terms of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act has not been complied with. A liability under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is sought to be fastened vicariously on the petitioner as a Director of the company, the principal accused being the company itself. It is a departure from the rule in criminal law against vicarious liability. A clear case should be spelled out in the complaint against the person sought to be made liable. Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act contains the requirements for making a person liable under the said provision. A complaint has to be examined by the Magistrate in the first instance on the basis of averments contained therein. If the Magistrate is satisfied that there are averments which bring the case within Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, then he would issue the process. Merely describing a person as Director in the company is not sufficient to satisfy the requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Even a non- director can be liable under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The averments in the complaint would also serve the purpose that the person sought to be made liable would know what is the case which is alleged against him/her. It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act that when the offence was committed, the accused person was incharge of, and responsible for the conduct of business of the company. This averment is a necessary requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and has to be made in a complaint. In the absence of such averment being made in the complaint, the requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act cannot be said to be satisfied. If the accused is the Managing Director or a Joint Managing Director, it is not necessary to make an averment in the complaint that he is incharge of, and is responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of the company.  In case of a director or an officer of the company who signed the cheque on behalf of the company, there is no need to make a specific averment that he was incharge of and was responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of the company or make any specific allegation about consent, connivance or negligence, but in case of non-signatory and Director, Secretary or Manager of the company, an averment has to be made that he/she was incharge of, and was responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of the company.  Learned counsel further submitted that under vicarious liability on dishonouring of cheque issued by a company, a non- executive Director of a company could not be prosecuted. Non- executive Director is no doubt a custodian of the governance of the company, but does not involve in the day-to-day affairs of the running of its business and only monitors the executive activity. Simply because a person is a Director of a company, does not make him liable under the Negotiable Instruments Act. Only those persons who were incharge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the time of commission of an offence, will be liable for criminal action. For making a Director of a company liable for the offences committed by the company under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, there must be specific averments against the Director showing as to how and in what manner the Director was responsible for the conduct of the business of the company.  earned counsel by referring to Pooja Ravinder Devidasani's case (supra), submitted that the ratio of aforesaid case fully covers the present controversy.  Learned counsel also submitted that summoning of an accused in a criminal case is a serious matter. Criminal law cannot be set into motion as a matter of course. The order of the Magistrate summoning the accused must reflect that he has applied his mind to the facts of the case and the law applicable thereto. The Court has to examine the nature of allegation made in the complaint and the evidence both oral and documentary in support thereof.  The Court has to carefully scrutinize the evidence brought on record and may even himself put questions to the complainant and his witnesses to elicit answers to find out the truthfulness of the allegations or otherwise\n**Argument by Respondent**: Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent relied upon Sonu Gupta Vs. Deepak Gupta and others, 2015(2) RCR (Criminal) 32, : (AIR 2015 SC (Supp) 684) Dev Raj Garg Vs. State of Punjab, 1997(2) RCR (Criminal) 26 and Smt. Manju Joon Vs. State of Haryana and others, 2009(1) RCR (Criminal) 363 and contended that the pleadings to the effect that the petitioner was active in business of the firm and satisfies the requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. he complaint cannot be quashed on the ground that there was no specific averment in the complaint that the petitioner was incharge and responsible to the firm for conduct of the business. Petitioner would be at liberty to prove before the Court that she was not responsible for conduct of the business of the firm and therefore, not liable. [\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Although, no particular form for making such an allegation is prescribed, but wholesome reading of the complaint would show that the substance of the accusation discloses that the accused person was incharge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time.   I have considered the controversy Perusal of the order dated 31.01.2017 passed by the trial Court, summoning the petitioner would also show that the summoning order is only under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The order does not show that the petitioner has been summoned under Section 141(2) of the Negotiable Instruments Act.  The offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is relatable to the signatory of the cheque. Sonu Gupta's case (supra) and Dev Raj Garg's case (supra) relates to order of summoning under Section 204 of Cr.P.C. Those cases are related to penal offences, where no such averments are required to be made in the context of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The requirement of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is somewhat different being of vicarious liability, therefore, requirement of summoning in penal offences is not just at par with that of summoning under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The view expressed in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. case (supra) was further relied by the Hon'ble Apex Court in subsequent judgments i.e. Central Bank of India Vs. Asian Global Limited and others, 2010(11) SCC 203: (AIR 2010 SC 2835 ) Harshanda Kumar \"D\" Vs. Rehati Lata Killey and others, 2011(3) SCC 351, Anita Handa Vs. M/s Godfather Tour and Travels Pvt. Ltd., 2012(2) RCR (Criminal) 854 and Golwal Sales Private Limited Vs. Anu Mehta and others, 2015(1) SCC 103 : (AIR 2015 SC 1072). 19. In view of aforesaid settled position of law, it can be seen that the complaint in question is wanting on material particulars. The requirement of law in respect of creating vicarious liability must be strictly construed. Since it is a penal provision, creating vicarious liability, therefore, it is not sufficient to make bald and cursory statement in the complaint that Director is incharge and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company without anything more. Rather in the instant case, no such averments have been made in respect of the petitioner being Director is also incharge and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business. The complaint must contain as to how and in what manner, the Director was incharge or was responsible to the company in conduct of its business. This should be in consonance with strict interpretation of penal statutes, especially, where such statute creates vicarious liability. [20]. In National Small Industries Corporation Vs. Harmeet Singh Paintal and another, 2010(3) SCC 330, the Hon'ble Apex Court has interpreted on the aforesaid lines that requirement in terms of pleading has to be construed not only to the extent of mentioning the Director to be incharge of and responsible to the company for doing its business, but strictly spell out as to how and in what manner, he was incharge and responsible for the conduct of its business.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED.\n\nThe main issue in this case revolves around the validity of a complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the petitioner for allegedly issuing a dishonored cheque in discharge of a legally enforceable debt. The lower court upheld the complaint after the petitioner admitted his signatures on the cheque and the demand notice was given.\n\nIn assessing the lower court's decision, it is clear that the petitioner's defence hinges on his claim that the cheques were blank except for his signatures and that he lost them. However, the lower court did not consider the evidence presented by the petitioner regarding the missing cheques, nor did it address the requirement of a relation of debtor and creditor between the parties.\n\nFurthermore, the lower court ignored the petitioner's argument that the complaint was filed beyond one month after the demand notice was given, which is contrary to the mandate of Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The trial court also failed to comply with the provisions of Section 251 Cr.P.C. before summoning the petitioner.\n\nTaking these errors into account, the lower court's decision to uphold the complaint cannot be considered legally sound. Therefore, the appeal must be allowed, and the complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act should be quashed."

Sri Asif Ali and another lodged under Section 138 read with S. 141, Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on the complaint of respondent no.5 dated 16/18.8.2018 (Annexure No.4, Writ Petition) (iv) issue such other writs, orders or directions as may be deemed appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case so as to give effect to the relief claimed above and protect and safeguard the rights and interest of the petitioners; (v) award costs in favour of the petitioners.\"  Heard Shri Anupam Mehrotra, learned Counsel for the petitioners, Shri Prachish Pandey, learned AGA for the respondents no.1/State and Shri Shishir Jain, learned Counsel for the respondent nos. 2 to 4 With the consent of the learned Counsel for the petitioners, learned AGA and learned Counsel for the respondent nos. 2 to 4, the present writ petition is being heard and decided at the admission stage itself. Shorn off unnecessary details, the essential skeletal material facts necessary for appreciation of the squabble are that petitioner no.1-Syed Asif Ali is the sole proprietor of M/s Bushrah Export House (petitioner no.2 herein), which engaged in the business of garment. Respondent no.5-Sri Praveen Kumar is stated to be a retired bank employee. It has been stated by the petitioners that in the year 2014, accused/petitioner no.1 learnt from the office of his Chartered Accountant, namely, Sri Akshay Kumar that one Praveen Kumar (respondent no.5) wants to sell his house. For the purpose of purchasing the house of respondent no.5, petitioner no.1 handed over two undated cheques, bearing No. 173883 for Rs.24,00,000/- and No. 173864 for Rs.6,00,000/-, to his Chartered Accountant. Both these cheques were of the account of M/s Bushrah Export House at the State Bank of India, Ashok Marg Branch, Lucknow and signed by the petitioner no.1 as the sole proprietor of M/s Bushrah Export House. However, the respondent no.5 had finally said that he does not want to sell the house. Therefore, the matter of the proposed sale and purchase of the said house ended there. It has also been stated by the petitioners that since 2014, after the respondent no.5 said that he does not want to sell the house, the aforesaid two cheques, in normal course of business between the petitioner no.1 and the Chartered Accountant of petitioner no.1, remained with the Chartered Accountant of the petitioner no.1. Subsequently, it has been informed by the Chartered Accountant that two undated signed cheques of the petitioner no.1 were stolen from the office of Chartered Accountant by the respondent no.5. Against this theft, the Chartered Accountant of the petitioner no.1 informed the police and also filed a complaint in the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (IV), Lucknow under Section 190 (a) read with Section 200 Cr.P.C. Thereafter, on 04.09.2020, the Chartered Account of the petitioner no.1 died on 04.09.2020.  According to the petitioners, on 17.07.2018, the respondent no.5 presented the aforesaid two stolen cheques to the Bank. On being informed by the bank about the presentation of the said cheques of a four years old series and of such a high amount, the petitioner no.1 asked the bank to put them on hold as the cheques were not issued by the petitioner no.1. Thus, the bank did not allow the encashment of aforesaid two cheques. Thereafter, the respondent no.5 filed a complaint case under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act before the Court of Special Chief Judicial Magistrate (Customs), Lucknow, which was registered as Case No. 6800 of 2018 : Sri Praveen Kumar Vs. Sri Asif Ali and another. It has been stated by the petitioners that in the aforesaid complaint, it has been alleged by the respondent no.5 that on 04.04.2018, a short term friendly loan of Rs.30,00,000/- for a period of three months at the rate of interest of 12 per cent per annum repayable on demand, was given by the respondent no.5 to the petitioner no.1 as per an oral agreement. It has also been alleged that two cheques allegedly issued by the petitioner no.1 to repay the said loan were dishonoured.  Thereafter, on 17.07.2018, fifteen days' notice under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was given by the respondent no.5 to the petitioner no.1 by way of notice dated 26.07.2018, which the petitioner no.1 is said to have been received on 28.07.2018 and then, 16/18.8.2018, the the aforesaid complaint case was filed within the period of one month prescribed under Section 142 (b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. According to the petitioners, vide order dated 18.08.2018, the complaint filed by the respondent no.5 was registered on its presentation before the Court of Special Chief Judicial Magistrate (Customs), which directed the listing of the complaint case for Section 200/202 Cr.P.C. on 13.09.2018. However, on 12.09.2018, the said case was transferred from the Court of Special Chief Judicial Magistrate (Customs), Lucknow to the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No.5, Lucknow and the file thereof was received in the said additional Court on 13.09.2018. Since then, the trial of the complaint case is being held by the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No. 5, Lucknow.  However, aggrieved by the cognizance of the complaint case, summoning order and the warrant issued therein, the accused/ petitioner no.1 filed a case before this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C., which was registered as Criminal Misc. Case No. 311 of 2019 : Syed Asif Ali Vs. Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No.5, Lucknow and another, wherein the petitioner no.1 has challenged the proceedings in case No. 6800 of 2018 pending in the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Court Room No. 5, Lucknow under Section 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.   Pursuant to the aforesaid order dated 09.12.2019, the petitioner no.1 applied for bail, which was granted by the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No. 5, Lucknow and since then, the petitioner no.1 is on bail. (12) After releasing the the petitioner no.1 on bail, he filed an application dated 28.02.2020 for discharge before the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No.5, Lucknow in the complaint case, to which respondent no.5/complainant has filed objections dated 06.03.2020. Thereafter, the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No. 5, Lucknow, vide order dated 15.01.2021, has rejected the said application for discharge dated 28.02.2020 filed by the petitioner no.1 on the ground that the plea of the accused/petitioner no.1 is a subject matter of evidence in trial. Thereafter, on 29.01.2021, the statement of the petitioner no.1 under Section 251 Cr.P.C. was recorded in the complaint case. On 19.02.2021, the respondent no.5 has filed statement under Section 254 of the Cr.P.C., annexing the Income Tax Return acknowledgments of the Assessment Years 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21. Thereafter, on 19.02.2021, the Additional Court directed that the complaint case shall be listed for cross examination on 8.03.2021 and on 08.03.2021, the said case has been directed to be listed on 1.4.2021. Thus, the complaint case filed by the respondent no.5 against the sole proprietorship of the petitioner no.1 is manifestly not maintainable. It has also been stated that the said transfer of the complaint case is an invalid exercise of power of distribution of business vested in the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Sections 15 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure as a retired District and Sessions Judge is not a Judicial Magistrate.  So far as the plea of the petitioners regarding the creation of Additional Courts of retired District and Sessions Judges by the impugned Government Orders, learned AGA has submitted that earlier the petitioner no.1/accused has challenged the proceedings of complaint case, bearing No. 6800 of 2018, filed by the respondent no.5 by filing application/petition, bearing No. 311 of 2019, under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure inter alia on the grounds that instead of examining the petitioner under Section 200 Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court below has accepted the affidavit and has also wrongly accepted the documentary evidence under Section 202 Cr.P.C. and further the Bank is also an accused in a case under Section 138 of the Nogotiable Instruments Act.  The retired District and Sessions Judge so appointed has not exercised the jurisdiction of Sessions Court but the Additional Court has only exercised the jurisdiction of Special Judicial Magistrate.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nShri Anupam Mehrota, learned Counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the trial by a retired District and Sessions Judge suffers from patent want of jurisdiction and is a nullity and void ab initio. Moreso, no offence is made out by the allegations made against the petitioners and the impugned trial is, inter alia, barred by the provisions of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 itself. It has been stated that the executive creation of the Court of a retired District and Sessions Judge is in violation of the fundamental principle which is also embodied in Section 6 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure that no Court can be created by an executive order as it requires authority of law to do so.  Elaborating his submissions, Sri Mehrotra has submitted that the trial of the alleged offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act, 1881\") by a retired District and Sessions Judge is not contemplated by law and is in gross violation of Section 142 (1) (c) of Act, 1881, which enjoins that notwithstanding anything contained in the Cr.P.C., no Court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act, 1881 and the Court of a retired District and Sessions Judge is per se inferior to a serving Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate of that first class. His submission is that the provision \"a Court within whose local jurisdiction\" in Section 142 (2) of the Act, 1881 reinforces that the trial of an offence under Section 138 of the Act, 1881 by the Court of a retired District and Sessions Judge constitutes by an executive order is completely unlawful as a retired District and Sessions Judge does not have any local jurisdiction within the meaning of Section 142 of the Act, 1881.  Thus, the transfer of complaint case to the Additional Court held by a retired District and Sessions Judge is an invalid exercise of the power of distribution of business vested in the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section 15 (2) of the Cr.P.C. as a retired District and Sessions Judge is not a judicial magistrate. (15) It has been argued by the learned Counsel for the petitioners that Chapter XVII of the Act, 1881 is a special law, which must be strictly construed and the application thereof cannot be stretched beyond what is expressly provided therein, nor the remedy of a civil suit under the general law is to be necessarily excluded in all cases.  Learned Counsel for the petitioners has contended that it is per se frivolous and vexatious that in the complaint, M/s Bushrah Export House has been arrayed as the accused no. 2 through its Sole Proprietor, the petitioner no.1/accused no.1. The sole proprietorship is not a \"company\" in view of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. \nArgument by the Respondent:\nPer contra, Shri Shishir Jain, learned Counsel for the High Court has submitted that in the year 2015, a letter dated 16.06.2015 of the Special Secretary, Government of U.P., was received in the office of the Hon'ble High Court in respect of establishment of 38 temporary additional Courts as per the th recommendations of the 14 Finance Commission in the districts where pendency was higher than the national average and had also desired proposal for creation of said Courts Upon consideration of the aforesaid letter, the Hon'ble High Court, vide letter dated 19.08.2015, had requested to the State Government to intimate the cadre of the proposed 38 temporary additional courts to be created in the State of U.P. to be manned by retired judges and contractual staff for disposing off such cases which constitute the majority of pendency i.e. motor vehicle challans, insurance claims and cheque matters, in terms of the proposal made in the report of 14th Finance Commission Elaborating his submission, Sri Jain has submitted that upon consideration of the matter, a Committee of Hon'ble Judges was constituted by the Hon'ble Chief Justice and the Committee, after due deliberations, has passed a resolution dated 16.05.2016. In pursuance of the same, option from the judicial officers of the cadre of U.P. Higher Judicial Services, who retired or going to retire during the period from 01.04.2013 to 31.03.2016, were invited by uploading the vacancy on official website of the High Court. It was also provided by the Committee that no Presiding Officer shall hold the office after he has attained the age of 70 years of age on 31.03.2020. Consequently, the High Court, on receipt of the requisite application from the retired judicial officer of the cadre of U.P. Higher Judicial Services and after scrutinizing the same, recommend the name of 38 retired judicial officers of U.P. Higher Judicial Services Cadre for their appointment as Presiding Officers of such additional Courts in the district and had requested to the State Government to communicate the order of the Government in this regard. In compliance thereof, the State Government, vide order dated 26.07.2016, had issued necessary orders in respect of appointment of 38 retired judicial officers of U.P.H.J.S. cadre as Presiding Officers of the 38 additional Courts. Thus, there is no illegality or infirmity in appointing the Presiding Officer of the additional Courts.   Learned Additional Government Advocate appearing on behalf of the State has reiterated the aforesaid submissions and has stated that in the instant writ petition, serious disputed question of facts viz. whether the cheque in question has been issued by the petitioner no.1 in favour of the respondent no.5 for payment of friendly loan or the cheque in question has been stolen by the respondent no.5, are involved in the present writ petition, which cannot be examined in writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India as these questions of fact can only be decided by the concerned competent court in a summary proceedings as provided under law. Therefore, the present writ petition in this regard is not maintainable and the same is liable to be dismissed on this count alone. Learned AGA has next submitted that against the order dated 21.01.2019, the petitioner no.1 had approached the Apex Court by filing Special Leave to Appeal No. 1380 of 2019, which was dismissed by the Apex Court vide judgment and order dated 09.12.2019 with liberty to the petitioner no.1 to appear before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow within four weeks and apply for bail. Pursuant to the aforesaid order of the Apex Court dated 09.12.2019, the petitioner no.1 applied for bail and he was granted bail by the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No. 5, Lucknow.  Thereafter, the petitioner no.1 had applied for discharge, which was rejected by the Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No. 5, Lucknow vide order dated 15.01.2021 on the ground that discharge of the petitioner no.1 in the complaint case is the subject matter of evidence in the trial. The trial is at advance stage. At this stage, the petitioner no.1 has filed this writ petition raising the plea that the creation of additional court vide impugned Government Orders by appointing the retired District and Sessions Judge is unconstitutional. Elaborating his submission, learned AGA has submitted that before the date of rejection of the application of discharge filed by the petitioner no.1, the petitioner no.1 has participated and actively contested the proceedings before the Additional Court created by the impugned Government Orders. The entire series of events shows that the petitioner no.1 with mala fide intention and oblique motive has raised the plea of appointment of the Additional Court as unconstitutional just to linger on the proceedings pending before the Additional Court.  Learned AGA has further submitted that the petitioners have not questioned the functioning/working of day to day affairs of the said Additional Court nor the petitioners have alleged that the Additional Court has passed the order with mala fide intention or extraneous consideration.  Lastly, learned AGA has submitted that looking to the huge pendency of cases like motor vehicle challans, insurance th claims and cheque matters and in view of the report of the 14 Finance Commission, the State Government has decided to create additional Court for the aforesaid purpose and on the basis of the recommendation of the High Court, 38 additional Courts for the aforesaid purposes have been created in the State of U.P. and appointment of the recommended retired officer of the U.P. Higher Judicial Officer has been issued in this regard Thus, there is no error in appointing the retired officer of the U.P. Higher Judicial Officer in the additional Courts as every formality before appointing them has been completed by the State. Moreso, the appointment of the retired District and Sessions Judge as Additional Court to try the cases pertaining to motor vehicle challans, insurance claims and cheque bouncing matters, has been made in terms of Section 13 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, which provided that High Court is empowered to confer upon any person who holds or has held any post under the Government, the powers conferred or conferrable by or under this Code on a Judicial Magistrate of first or second class. Such Magistrates shall be called Special Judicial Magistrate and shall be appointed for a term not exceeding one year at a time. His submission is that the appointment of the Additional Court has been made on the recommendation of the High Court and the retired District and Sessions Judge so appointed has given the power to exercise the jurisdiction of Special Judicial Magistrate to try the cases of motor vehicle challans, insurance claims and cheque bouncing matters within the frame work as provided under law.  In these backgrounds, learned AGA has submitted that the judgments, which have been cited by the learned Counsel for the petitioners, is distinguishable under the facts and circumstances of the case and are not relevant for adjudication of the issue involved in the matter.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe learned Single Judge, vide order dated 21.01.2019, disposed of the aforesaid case filed by the petitioner no.1 under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Against the order dated 21.01.2019, the petitioner no.1 has approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court by filing Special Leave to Appeal (Criminal) No. 1380 of 2019 : Syed Asif Ali Vs. Praveen Kumar, in which the Hon'ble Supreme Court, vide order dated 09.12.2019, dismissed the SLP with liberty to the petitioner no.1 to appear before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Lucknow within four weeks and apply for bail. Learned Single Judge of this Court, vide judgment and order dated 21.01.2019, disposed of the aforesaid petition filed by the petitioner no.1 under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the ground of having no force in the petition.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Having considered the submissions of the learned Counsel for the petitioners, learned Counsel for the High Court and learned AGA, we are in full agreement with the submission of the learned AGA that the present writ petition is not maintainable as disputed question of fact relating to the cheque in question is involved in the present writ petitionSo far as the plea of the petitioners that appointment of the retired District and Sessions Judge by the impugned Government Orders as Additional Court is unconstitutional as their appointment has been made by issuing an executive order, we think it appropriate to discuss the manner in which the impugned Government Orders have been issued and appointment of the retired District and Sessions Judge has been mad) The Law Commission had taken note of the experience of the judicial post for the purpose of appointment and conferment of power of Special Judicial Magistrates with the object of securing the expeditious disposal of criminal cases. The Joint Select Committee also took note of the criticisms against the system of Honorary Magistrates and expressed the view that proper way to deal with the arrears of petty criminal cases was to appoint sufficient number of stipendiary Magistrates as a wholesome deletion of the institution of Honorary Members would give rise to problems in some States. The Joint Select Committee suggested that provision be made for the appointment of Special Judicial Magistrates with certain modifications in the earlier system. One of the suggestions was that the appointees should either be persons in Government service or those who have retired from Government service. As a result of these deliberations, Section 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 came to be enacted in their present formHaving regard to the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission and looking to the huge pendency of cases in lower Court, the Central Government, vide letter dated 29.05.2015, has made certain recommendation to the State Government. In order to implement the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission, the State Government, vide letter th dated 16 June, 2015, has requested the Hon'ble High Court for establishment of 38 temporary Additional Courts as per the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission in the districts where the pendency was higher than the national average and had also desired the explicit proposal for creation of the said Courts. On considering the aforesaid letter dated 16.06.2015, the Hon'ble High Court, vide order dated 19.08.2015, requested the State Government to intimate the cadre of the proposed 38 temporary additional Courts to be created in the State of U.P. to be manned by retired judges and contractual staff for disposing off such cases which constitute the majority of pendency i.e. motor vehicle challans, insurance claims and check bouncing matters, to the Court.Pursuant to the aforesaid letters of the High Court, the State Government, vide letter dated 16.10.2015, requested to the Hon'ble High Court that looking to the nature of the cases, decision with regard to the appointment of the Presiding Officer and staff be taken at the end of Hon'ble High Court. Thereafter, Hon'ble the Chief Justice has constituted three Hon'ble Judges Committee, which, vide its resolution dated 16.05.2016, required option from such judicial officers of the cadre of U.P. Higher Judicial Services, who have retired or going to retire during the period from 01.04.2013 to 31.03.2016 by uploading the vacancy on official website of the High Court.The Hon'ble High Court, after adopting due procedure, recommended the names of 38 retired Judicial Officers of Higher Judicial Services cadre for their appointment as Presiding Officer of such additional courts in the districts. Pursuant to the aforesaid recommendations, impugned Government Orders have been issued. A bare reading of the aforesaid Section 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 reveals that it confer power on the High Court to make the appointments and confer such of the powers as it deems proper from the whole bundle of powers conferrable by or under the Code of Criminal Procedure on a Judicial Magistrate of the first or second class or conferrable on a Metropolitan Magistrate as the case may be. The choice of power to be conferred on the appointees under this provision is left to the sole discretion of the High Court.The proviso to each sub-section makes it clear that the appointee must possess such qualification and experience in relation to legal affairs as the High Court may by rules specify. Thirdly, the words \"who holds or has held any post under the Government\" do not necessarily exclude judicial officers belonging to the subordinate judiciary of a State/Union Territory. The sub-sections merely enable the High Court to appoint persons, other than judicial officers, who hold or have held any post under the Government and who possess the qualification and experience in relation to legal affairs as may be specified by the High Court. Parliament has taken care to leave the question of specifying the requirements for appointment to the High Court.There is therefore, no warrant for placing a narrow construction on the words 'who holds or has held any post under the Government' to confine them to appointments of Government servants, present or past only, and to exclude members belonging to the subordinate Judicial Services. Furthermore, the duration of appointment has been restricted to one year at a time which would give the High Court an opportunity to observe the work of the appointee to enable it to decide whether or not to extend the appointment for a further period, if the workload justifies such continuance. We are, therefore, of the opinion that there is no error in the impugned Government Orders appointing the retired District and Sessions Jude in temporary Additional Court to try the cases of motor vehicle challans, insurance claims and cheque bouncing matters. It has been informed by the learned AGA as well as learned Counsel for the High Court that the term of 38 retired District and Sessions Judge as Additional Court in pursuance of the th recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission has been extended from time to time and lastly, vide Government Order dated 05.03.2021, their term has been extended w.e.f. 01.03.2021 to 28.02.2022 It is needless to mention that though the appointment of the retired District and Sessions Judge has been made as Additional Court to try the cases of motor vehicle challans, insurance claims and cheque bouncing matters but they have not been given the power by the High Court to exercise or act as a Sessions Judge but the High Court has treated them as Special Judicial Magistrates having the powers to try the cases of motor vehicle challans, insurance claims and cheque bouncing matters only and not beyond that A bare reading of the aforesaid Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act reveals that it governs taking of cognizance of the offence and starts with a non-obstante clause. It provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under Section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course and such complaint is made within one month of the date on which the cause of action arises under clause (c) of the proviso to Section 138. In terms of sub-section (c) to Section 142, no court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class is competent to try any offence punishable under Section 138. Petition dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 634ea1de0eb98db8410fb115\n**Facts**: Since the common law points are involved in all these petitions, all these petitions are taken up for hearing together. The petitioners in each of these petitions are facing trial under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \u2018the N.I. Act\u2019).  So far as Criminal Writ Petition No. 3152 of 2009 is concerned, a Division Bench of this Court by its order dated 2nd December, 2009 directed the Registry to club this petition along with Writ Petition Nos. 1544 of 2009 and 1545 of 2009, as the point involved in the said petition is the same and that is how all these writ petitions are placed for hearing together. On behalf of the petitioners it is submitted that the provisions of Section 145 of the N.I. Act are ultra vires the provisions of Article 21 of the Constitution of India and the said Section is required to be struck down. . As pointed out earlier, the petitioners are facing trial under section 138 of the N.I. Act. According to the petitioners, at the time of trial, in lieu of the examination in chief, the original complainants have tendered their affidavits which contain various leading questions. The petitioners, who are the accused, therefore, objected the same before the concerned Magistrate. So far as Writ Petition No. 1544 is concerned, on behalf of the accused an application was preferred for making a reference under section 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 read with section 142 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872(hereinafter referred to as the \u201cEvidence Act\u201d).  A revision was preferred against the said order before the District Court at Thane bearing Criminal Revision Petition No. 39 of 2009.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The learned Magistrate by an order dated 17th February, 2009 came to the conclusion that no legal question arises as to the validity of any Act which is necessary to dispose the case to make reference to the High Court.  The same was also dismissed on 6th May, 2009 against which above Writ Petition No. 1544 of 2009 is filed.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: . Mr. Pradhan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners in Writ Petition Nos. 1544 and 1545 of 2009, submitted that as per Section 142 of the Evidence Act, leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party, be asked in an examination\u00adin\u00adchief, or in a re\u00adexamination, except with the permission of the Court. Mr. Pradhan submitted that in the affidavit submitted in lieu of examination\u00adin\u00adchief by the complainant, leading questions are finding place in such affidavit. It is submitted by Mr. Pradhan that by permitting the complainant to tender his affidavit, it may prejudice the case of the accused as, though the accused can object to putting leading questions in the examination\u00adin\u00adchief in ordinary criminal trial, he has no such right to object, if affidavit in lieu of examination\u00adin\u00adchief is tendered under Section 145 (1) of the N.I. Act. It is submitted by Mr. Pradhan that in view of the same, Section 145 of the N.I. Act is ultra vires the provisions of Article 21 of the Constitution of India as it denies the accused an opportunity of a fair trial. The said provision is also violative of Section 141 of the Evidence Act.  He submitted that under the N.I. Act also the accused is entitled to have a fair trial and the provisions of the Evidence Act is also applicable to such trial. It is submitted by Mr. Pradhan that even if a person is tried under the N.I. Act, nonethless he is an accused and is required to be treated at par with other accused who might be facing trial under different enactments. Mr. Pradhan submitted that no affidavit in lieu of examination\u00adin\u00adchief should be permitted and, therefore, Section 145 of the N.I. Act should be struck down. According to Mr. Pradhan, if a person is permitted to put leading questions in the affidavit, it will prejudice the case of the accused and it will be contrary to the provisions of Section 142 of the Evidence Act. Mr. Pradhan in this behalf relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Varkey Joseph v. State of Kerala AIR 1993 SC 1982 1993 ILO SC 86 . It has been held by the Supreme Court that the prosecutor cannot put leading questions on the material part of evidence which the witness intends to give in evidence against the accused. Such leading questions offend right of accused to fair trial under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Relying on the said judgment, it is submitted by Mr. Pradhan that Section 145 of the N.I. Act is required to be struck down as the same is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India as the accused is denied the fair opportunity to prove his case during trial.  Mr. Pradhan further submitted that once the affidavit is tendered in evidence, no remedy is available with the accused. Mr. Pradhan submitted that in an indirect manner the complainant is permitted to put leading questions by placing the same in the affidavit. Mr. Pradhan submitted that the fundamental right of the accused to have a fair trial is denied if affidavit is permitted in lieu of examination\u00adin\u00adchief and, therefore, such a provision should be struck down as violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Mr. D.J. Khambata, learned Additional Solicitor General, on the other hand, submitted that so far as section 138 of the N.I. Act is concerned, it is a separate procedure enacted for the purpose of speedy trial in connection with dishonour of cheques. It is submitted by Mr. Khambata that when there is a special statute enacted, it overrides other general statues. Mr. Khambata submitted that Section 138 of the N.I. Act is a special provision enacted and, therefore, it cannot be argued that the provisions under such enactment are inconsistent with other law or any other enactment. Mr. Khambata further submitted that even if there is any inconsistency, in given case, the provisions of the N.I. Act shall prevail as the same is also a Central Act like the Evidence Act. Mr. Khambata further submitted that so far as Section 142 of the Evidence Act is concerned, even in civil trial same is applicable, yet in lieu of examination\u00adin\u00adchief affidavit is permitted to be tendered in evidence. Mr. Khambata submitted that, even otherwise, sufficient safeguard is provided to the accused so far as the N.I. Act is concerned as the accused is given opportunity to cross\u00adexamine the complainant on such affidavit. Even as per Section 145 of the N.I. Act, the evidence of the complainant may be given by him on affidavit and may, subject to all just exceptions, be read in evidence in any enquiry, trial or other proceeding.  Mr. Khambata submitted that it is not for the accused to insist that he must be tried in a particular manner. It is submitted that a special machinery is provided under the N.I. Act for speedy disposal of certain type of cases. It is submitted that the accused is given all the right to put his case. Even such affidavit can also be taken subject to just exceptions and in a given case the Court may refuse to take such affidavit on record. He, therefore, submitted that the said provision cannot be said to be in any way violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India as the accused is given fair opportunity to defend his case. Mr. Khambata submitted that there is nothing like putting any questions in the affidavit as the affidavit is not in the form of questions and answers and, therefore, even otherwise, there is no question of putting any leading questions when the complainant is given evidence on affidavit as per section 145 (1) of the N.I. Act.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 7. We have heard the learned counsel appearing in the matters at great length. We have also considered the relevant provisions of the N.I. Act and the Evidence Act. It is not in dispute that the accused in each of these petitions are facing trial under section 138 of the N.I. Act in connection with the bouncing of the cheques. In order to find out as to whether by allowing the complainant to tender affidavit in lieu of examination\u00adin\u00adchief, any prejudice is caused to the accused, it is necessary to examine the scheme of the Evidence Act as well as the N.I. Act. So far as the question about leading questions are concerned, Sections 141 and 142 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provide as under: The Court shall permit leading questions as to matters which are introductory or undisputed, or which have, in its opinion, been already sufficiently proved. . So far as leading questions are concerned, normally such questions cannot be asked in examination\u00adin\u00adchief except with the leave of the Court. So far as Section 138 of the N.I. Act is concerned, the same was inserted by the Banking Public Financial Institutions and Negotiable Instruments Laws (Amendment) Act, 1988 (66 of 988) with effect from 01.04.1989. It provides for a special machinery in connection with dis\u00adhonour of cheque due to insufficient funds in the account of the drawer of the cheque. The said Act is, therefore, a complete code in itself and provides procedure in connection with the remedy available to the complainant in case of dishonour of cheques. Section 143 of the Act permits the Court to try such cases in a summary manner.  It is required to be noted that in a given case, the Magistrate may even refuse to take such affidavit on record, if any exception is made out. Considering the scheme of the Act, in our view, it cannot be said that simply because the complainant is permitted to give evidence by way of an affidavit, the right of the accused to a fair trial is denied in any manner. The accused is entitled to cross\u00adexamine the said witness on such affidavit. Not only that, in a given case the accused may ask the concerned Court not to take such affidavit on record, if any exception is made out. Proper safeguards are already provided in the N.I. Act in this behalf to the accused.  It cannot be said that the provision by which the complainant is permitted to tender his evidence by way of affidavit is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India in any manner. The Magistrate is required to follow the procedure of summary trial and if a particular procedure is provided in the Act by which the complainant is permitted to give affidavit, in our view, it cannot prejudice the case of the accused in any manner nor such a provision is violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India nor it is violative of the provisions of Sections 141 and 142 of the Evidence Act. Even under Section 142 of the Evidence Act, leading questions can be asked with the permission of the Court in examination\u00adin\u00adchief. We agree with the submission of Mr. Khambata that in the affidavit, there is no question of putting any leading questions as no questions are put in such an affidavit. Relying upon the same it is submitted by Mr. Khambata that when special law is now enacted i.e. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act even otherwise general provisions of section 142 of the Indian Evidence Act is not applicable to the such trial and proceedings.\n",

Shorn off unnecessary details, the essential skeletal material facts necessary for appreciation of the squabble are that petitioner no.1-Syed Asif Ali is the sole proprietor of M/s Bushrah Export House (petitioner no.2 herein), which engaged in the business of garment. Respondent no.5-Sri Praveen Kumar is stated to be a retired bank employee. It has been stated by the petitioners that in the year 2014, accused/petitioner no.1 learnt from the office of his Chartered Accountant, namely, Sri Akshay Kumar that one Praveen Kumar (respondent no.5) wants to sell his house. For the purpose of purchasing the house of respondent no.5, petitioner no.1 handed over two undated cheques, bearing No. 173883 for Rs.24,00,000/- and No. 173864 for Rs.6,00,000/-, to his Chartered Accountant. Both these cheques were of the account of M/s Bushrah Export House at the State Bank of India, Ashok Marg Branch, Lucknow and signed by the petitioner no.1 as the sole proprietor of M/s Bushrah Export House. However, the respondent no.5 had finally said that he does not want to sell the house. Therefore, the matter of the proposed sale and purchase of the said house ended there. It has also been stated by the petitioners that since 2014, after the respondent no.5 said that he does not want to sell the house, the aforesaid two cheques, in normal course of business between the petitioner no.1 and the Chartered Accountant of petitioner no.1, remained with the Chartered Accountant of the petitioner no.1. Subsequently, it has been informed by the Chartered Accountant that two undated signed cheques of the petitioner no.1 were stolen from the office of Chartered Accountant by the respondent no.5. Against this theft, the Chartered Accountant of the petitioner no.1 informed the police and also filed a complaint in the Court of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (IV), Lucknow under Section 190 (a) read with Section 200 Cr.P.C. Thereafter, on 04.09.2020, the Chartered Account of the petitioner no.1 died on 04.09.2020.  According to the petitioners, on 17.07.2018, the respondent no.5 presented the aforesaid two stolen cheques to the Bank. On being informed by the bank about the presentation of the said cheques of a four years old series and of such a high amount, the petitioner no.1 asked the bank to put them on hold as the cheques were not issued by the petitioner no.1. Thus, the bank did not allow the encashment of aforesaid two cheques. Thereafter, the respondent no.5 filed a complaint case under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act before the Court of Special Chief Judicial Magistrate (Customs), Lucknow, which was registered as Case No. 6800 of 2018 : Sri Praveen Kumar Vs. Sri Asif Ali and another. It has been stated by the petitioners that in the aforesaid complaint, it has been alleged by the respondent no.5 that on 04.04.2018, a short term friendly loan of Rs.30,00,000/- for a period of three months at the rate of interest of 12 per cent per annum repayable on demand, was given by the respondent no.5 to the petitioner no.1 as per an oral agreement. It has also been alleged that two cheques allegedly issued by the petitioner no.1 to repay the said loan were dishonoured.  Thereafter, on 17.07.2018, fifteen days' notice under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was given by the respondent no.5 to the petitioner no.1 by way of notice dated 26.07.2018, which the petitioner no.1 is said to have been received on 28.07.2018 and then, 16/18.8.2018, the the aforesaid complaint case was filed within the period of one month prescribed under Section 142 (b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. According to the petitioners, vide order dated 18.08.2018, the complaint filed by the respondent no.5 was registered on its presentation before the Court of Special Chief Judicial Magistrate (Customs), which directed the listing of the complaint case for Section 200/202 Cr.P.C. on 13.09.2018. However, on 12.09.2018, the said case was transferred from the Court of Special Chief Judicial Magistrate (Customs), Lucknow to the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No.5, Lucknow and the file thereof was received in the said additional Court on 13.09.2018. Since then, the trial of the complaint case is being held by the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No. 5, Lucknow.  However, aggrieved by the cognizance of the complaint case, summoning order and the warrant issued therein, the accused/ petitioner no.1 filed a case before this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C., which was registered as Criminal Misc. Case No. 311 of 2019 : Syed Asif Ali Vs. Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No.5, Lucknow and another, wherein the petitioner no.1 has challenged the proceedings in case No. 6800 of 2018 pending in the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Court Room No. 5, Lucknow under Section 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.   Pursuant to the aforesaid order dated 09.12.2019, the petitioner no.1 applied for bail, which was granted by the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No. 5, Lucknow and since then, the petitioner no.1 is on bail. (12) After releasing the the petitioner no.1 on bail, he filed an application dated 28.02.2020 for discharge before the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No.5, Lucknow in the complaint case, to which respondent no.5/complainant has filed objections dated 06.03.2020. Thereafter, the Court of Presiding Officer, Additional Court, Room No. 5, Lucknow, vide order dated 15.01.2021, has rejected the said application for discharge dated 28.02.2020 filed by the petitioner no.1 on the ground that the plea of the accused/petitioner no.1 is a subject matter of evidence in trial. Thereafter, on 29.01.2021, the statement of the petitioner no.1 under Section 251 Cr.P.C. was recorded in the complaint case. On 19.02.2021, the respondent no.5 has filed statement under Section 254 of the Cr.P.C., annexing the Income Tax Return acknowledgments of the Assessment Years 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21. Thereafter, on 19.02.2021, the Additional Court directed that the complaint case shall be listed for cross examination on 8.03.2021 and on 08.03.2021, the said case has been directed to be listed on 1.4.2021. Thus, the complaint case filed by the respondent no.5 against the sole proprietorship of the petitioner no.1 is manifestly not maintainable. It has also been stated that the said transfer of the complaint case is an invalid exercise of power of distribution of business vested in the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Sections 15 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure as a retired District and Sessions Judge is not a Judicial Magistrate.  So far as the plea of the petitioners regarding the creation of Additional Courts of retired District and Sessions Judges by the impugned Government Orders, learned AGA has submitted that earlier the petitioner no.1/accused has challenged the proceedings of complaint case, bearing No. 6800 of 2018, filed by the respondent no.5 by filing application/petition, bearing No. 311 of 2019, under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure inter alia on the grounds that instead of examining the petitioner under Section 200 Code of Criminal Procedure, the Court below has accepted the affidavit and has also wrongly accepted the documentary evidence under Section 202 Cr.P.C. and further the Bank is also an accused in a case under Section 138 of the Nogotiable Instruments Act.  The retired District and Sessions Judge so appointed has not exercised the jurisdiction of Sessions Court but the Additional Court has only exercised the jurisdiction of Special Judicial Magistrate.\\nArgument by the Petitioner:\\nShri Anupam Mehrota, learned Counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the trial by a retired District and Sessions Judge suffers from patent want of jurisdiction and is a nullity and void ab initio. Moreso, no offence is made out by the allegations made against the petitioners and the impugned trial is, inter alia, barred by the provisions of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 itself. It has been stated that the executive creation of the Court of a retired District and Sessions Judge is in violation of the fundamental principle which is also embodied in Section 6 of the Code of the Criminal Procedure that no Court can be created by an executive order as it requires authority of law to do so.  Elaborating his submissions, Sri Mehrotra has submitted that the trial of the alleged offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the \\\"Act, 1881\\\") by a retired District and Sessions Judge is not contemplated by law and is in gross violation of Section 142 (1) (c) of Act, 1881, which enjoins that notwithstanding anything contained in the Cr.P.C., no Court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act, 1881 and the Court of a retired District and Sessions Judge is per se inferior to a serving Metropolitan Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate of that first class. His submission is that the provision \\\"a Court within whose local jurisdiction\\\" in Section 142 (2) of the Act, 1881 reinforces that the trial of an offence under Section 138 of the Act, 1881 by the Court of a retired District and Sessions Judge constitutes by an executive order is completely unlawful as a retired District and Sessions Judge does not have any local jurisdiction within the meaning of Section 142 of the Act, 1881.  Thus, the transfer of complaint case to the Additional Court held by a retired District and Sessions Judge is an invalid exercise of the power of distribution of business vested in the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section 15 (2) of the Cr.P.C. as a retired District and Sessions Judge is not a judicial magistrate. (15) It has been argued by the learned Counsel for the petitioners that Chapter XVII of the Act, 1881 is a special law, which must be strictly construed and the application thereof cannot be stretched beyond what is expressly provided therein, nor the remedy of a civil suit under the general law is to be necessarily excluded in all cases.  Learned Counsel for the petitioners has contended that it is per se frivolous and vexatious that in the complaint, M/s Bushrah Export House has been arrayed as the accused no. 2 through its Sole Proprietor, the petitioner no.1/accused no.1. The sole proprietorship is not a \\\"company\\\" in view of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. \\nArgument by the Respondent:\\nPer contra, Shri Shishir Jain, learned Counsel for the High Court has submitted that in the year 2015, a letter dated 16.06.2015 of the Special Secretary, Government of U.P., was received in the office of the Hon'ble High Court in respect of establishment of 38 temporary additional Courts as per the th recommendations of the 14 Finance Commission in the districts where pendency was higher than the national average and had also desired proposal for creation of said Courts Upon consideration of the aforesaid letter, the Hon'ble High Court, vide letter dated 19.08.2015, had requested to the State Government to intimate the cadre of the proposed 38 temporary additional courts to be created in the State of U.P. to be manned by retired judges and contractual staff for disposing off such cases which constitute the majority of pendency i.e. motor vehicle challans, insurance claims and cheque matters, in terms of the proposal made in the report of 14th Finance Commission Elaborating his submission, Sri Jain has submitted that upon consideration of the matter, a Committee of Hon'ble Judges was constituted by the Hon'ble Chief Justice and the Committee, after due deliberations, has passed a resolution dated 17.02.2015 recommending that the proposal for creation of additional Courts in the State of U.P. to be manned by retired District and Sessions Judges and contractual staff may be accepted and the Hon'ble High Court may take necessary action for implementation of the same. Upon acceptance of the proposal, the Hon'ble High Court, vide letter dated 06.05.2016, has informed the Government about the acceptance of the proposal for creation of additional Courts in the State of U.P. to be manned by retired District and Sessions Judges and contractual staff. Accordingly, the Government, vide order dated 30.12.2015, has accepted the proposal for creation of 38 additional Courts in the districts where pendency was higher than the national average and the Hon'ble High Court, vide letter dated 01.01.2017, has informed the Government about the readiness of the High Court for implementation of the said proposal.  Thereafter, the Government, vide order dated 02.01.2018, has issued necessary guidelines for creation of additional Courts in the State of U.P. to be manned by retired District and Sessions Judges and contractual staff. Upon issuance of the aforesaid guidelines, the Hon'ble High Court, vide order dated 02.01.2018, has constituted a Committee for creation of additional CourTS in the State of U.P. to be manned by retired District and Sessions Judges and contractual staff.  The Committee, constituted by the Hon'ble High Court, vide letter dated 08.01.2018, has identified 38 districts in the State of U.P. where pendency was higher than the national average and has recommended for creation of additional Courts in the said 38 districts. Pursuant to the recommendation of the Committee, the Government, vide order dated 06.02.2018, has accorded its approval for creation of 38 additional Courts in the State of U.P. to be manned by retired District and Sessions Judges and contractual staff. Upon approval of the Government, vide order dated 07.02.2018, the Hon'ble High Court has constituted 38 additional Courts in the State of U.P. to be manned by retired District and Sessions Judges and contractual staff.  Shri Jain has submitted that the aforesaid additional Courts have been created by the Hon'ble High Court for expeditious disposal of cases and to reduce the pendency of cases. (16) It has been submitted that the creation of additional CourTS by the Hon'ble High Court is in exercise of the powers vested in it under Sections 14(2) and 15 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the Cr.P.C.) and the impugned Government Orders dated 30.12.2015 and 02.01.2018, are, therefore, intra vires the Cr.P.C. It has been argued that the additional CourTS constituted by the Hon'ble High Court are courts within the meaning of Section 404 Cr.P.C. and a retired District and Sessions Judge so appointed is a judicial magistrate within the meaning of Section 2(f) Cr.P.C. Hence, the trial by the retired District and Sessions Judge is intra vires the Cr.P.C. It has been argued that the additional CourTS constituted by the Hon'ble High Court are not courts created by the executive and the retired District and Sessions Judges so appointed are not judges appointed by the executive.  Thus, the transfer of the complaint case to the Additional Court held by a retired District and Sessions Judge is a valid exercise of the power of distribution of business vested in the Chief Judicial Magistrate under Section 15 (2) of the Cr.P.C. and the aforesaid Government Orders dated 30.12.2015 and 02.01.2018, are, therefore, intra vires the Cr.P.C. It has been submitted that the provision for trial of an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act by a retired District and Sessions Judge is intra vires the Cr.P.C. and the provisions of Section 142 (1) (c) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are not attracted as a retired District and Sessions Judge is a judicial magistrate within the meaning of Section 2(f) Cr.P.C. and the trial by a retired District and Sessions Judge is intra vires the Cr.P.C.

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe appellant challenges the judgment dated 04.09.2014 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Vasco in the Criminal Case No.24/OA/NIA/2012/C, pursuant to which the complaint filed by the appellant under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ( Act for short hereinafter) came to be dismissed and the accused was acquitted of the said offence. Aggrieved by the said judgment, the appellant challenged the same on the grounds that the learned Trial Court had misdirected itself on facts and in law while passing the impugned judgment. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\n. Heard Shri Shailendra G. Bhobe, learned Advocate on behalf of the appellants who reiterated the grounds urged in the appeal and submitted that the learned Trial Court had erroneously held that the respondent no.1 had probablised his defence. He adverted to the impugned judgment and submitted that in the face of the undisputed signature of the respondent on the cheque, the predicates of Section 138 of the Act stood amply proved and therefore, it was a fit case to convict the respondent. \nArgument by the Respondent:\nShri Rohan Dessai, learned Advocate for the respondents submitted that the appellants had miserably failed to show that the cheque was issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt and therefore, looking to the tenor of the findings in the judgment, the respondent had clearly established his case in defence and therefore, no interference was called for with the judgment under consideration.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nhe learned Trial Court failed to consider the statutory presumptions that arose in favour of the appellant under Sections 118 and 139 of the Act and further to evaluate the evidence adduced by the appellant bearing in mind the said statutory presumptions.  The learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class failed to consider that the respondent no.1 had admitted that he had signed the dishonoured cheque and in view thereof, ought to have drawn the necessary presumption in favour of the complainant that there was a legally enforceable debt in their favour and on account of the dishonour of the cheque, the appellants were entitled to a judgment of conviction in their favour.  The learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class failed to come to the conclusion that the respondent no.1 was successful in rebutting the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. The learned Trial Court ought to have considered that the respondent no.1 was the manager of the appellant at the time of the loan application and there could not have been any manipulation in the loan application. The learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class had therefore, rightly held that the defence of the accused that he had not obtained any loan from the appellant was probabilised and in view of the matter held that the ingredients of the offence under Section 138 of the Act were not proved and acquitted the respondent of the said charge by the judgment under challenge The appellant had as rightly submitted by Shri Dessai miserably failed to show that the cheque though signed by the respondent was issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt and therefore, the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class had rightly acquitted the accused. The learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class had further clearly held that there was no application for loan placed before the committee in the meeting held on 17.06.2009 as no such application was in existence on that day.\n",
    "Case_Result": "The impugned judgment was liable for interference on such and similar grounds taken in the appeal memo and therefore the appeal had to be allowed.4. i have heard Shri S. Bhobe, learned Advocate for the appellant and Shri Rohan Dessai, learned Advocate for the respondents and besides considered the judgment under challenge.No doubt, the respondent no.1 had issued the cheque in question favouring the appellant, however, a look at the judgment under challenge would indicate that there were clear flaws in the transaction going to the root of the matter probabalising the defence raised by the respondent. In that context, the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class had rightly found favour with the contention on behalf of the respondent no.1 that no loan whatsoever was granted by the appellant to the respondent.Furthermore, there were discrepancies in the dates regarding the said transaction in which the appellant claimed that the loan was granted to the said respondent. The learned Trial Court had also found favour with the contention on behalf of the respondent that with the monthly income of the respondent being only `4,671/- then how at all the appellant could have sanctioned the loan of `2,50,000/- to the respondent with equated monthly installment of `5160/- which was much more than his entire monthly earnings. The learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class had found favour with the case in defence that no loan was obtained by the respondent much less the plea of the appellant that it was granted for expansion of his business. It is another matter that the appellant had failed to show that the respondent was in some business and that in that connection he had obtained the loan for the expansion of his business. Shri Rohan Dessai, learned Advocate for the respondent had touched upon the relevant findings of the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class in the impugned judgment to show how the respondent had rebutted the statutory presumptions. It was borne out from the records that the process of the loan started with the application for the loan of the borrower and thereafter, the borrower had to submit all his documents to the appellant to sanction the loan and only thereafter the documents were placed before the managing committee which took a decision depending upon the paying capacity of the borrower and only thereafter was the loan sanctioned.The learned Judicial Magistrate had found on the basis of the evidence produced on record on behalf of the said respondent that the loan application was allegedly made by him on 29.06.2009 unlike the resolution adopted by the appellant's managing committee on 17.06.2009 sanctioning the loan much before it could even be applied for by the respondent. The learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class had also found that the accused was not a part of the meeting held on 17.06.2009 and in view of the same, it was difficult to understand how the application for loan was placed by the chairman in the meeting on 17.06.2009 and how the loan came to be sanctioned even before the application came to be filed by the respondent. The very fact that there was no loan application as on 17.06.2009 falsified the contents of the minutes of the resolution produced by the appellant. Appeal dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e990d\n**Facts**: The applicant herein is the original complainant who has challenged impugned judgment and order dated 28.02.2017 passed by the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Warud (trial Court) in Summary Criminal Case No.114/2012, whereby the trial Court acquitted the respondent for offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  Having heard the counsel for the applicant, sufficient ground is made out for grant of leave. Hence leave granted to the applicant to challenge the said impugned judgment and order. Criminal Appeal No.429/2018. It needs to be examined whether the trial Court in such circumstances was justified in acquitting the respondent in the present case. The facts in the present case are in a narrow compass. The appellant (original complainant) and the respondent (original accused) are related to each other having cordial relations. It was the case of the appellant that the respondent had approached him for a hand loan of Rs. 2 lakhs and that the appellant had given him cash amount of Rs. 2 lakhs. According to the appellant, in order to repay the said loan, the respondent had issued two cheques, but when they were presented for encashment, they were returned by the Bank with the remarks \"funds insufficient\". The appellant issued notice to the respondent in respect of the dishonour of the cheques, but the respondent failed to respond to the same and, therefore, the appellant was constrained to file complaint under the provisions of the said Act before the trial Court. In the trial Court, the appellant led oral and documentary evidence while the respondent failed to lead any evidence in support of his stand. Therefore, when the complaint came up for consideration before the trial Court, it was only the complaint of the complainant, documents filed therewith and the oral evidence of the appellant that was available on record.  It was the case of the respondent in arguments before the trial Court that the appellant had failed to give necessary details of when and how the said amount of hand loan was given to the respondent and that there was ample material on record in the form of cross-examination of the appellant, indicating that the cheque in question had been issued in the context of another transaction towards security.  Before referring to the evidence and material on record in the present case, in order to examine whether the appellant was justified in contending that presumption operated against the respondent, which remained unrebutted, it would be necessary to refer to few precedents which would help in answering the said question.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  The trial Court considered the entire material on record and by the impugned judgment and order, it was held that although presumption in favour of the appellant did operate under Sections 118 and 139 of the said Act, there was sufficient material on record to demonstrate that the defence of the respondent was probable. On this basis, the trial Court acquitted the respondent.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Mrs. R.D. Raskar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, submitted that the trial Court had committed an error in holding that the defence of the respondent was probable because the respondent had failed to send reply to the statutory notice, he had failed to file any submissions or response to the complaint before the trial Court and that he had not entered the witness box in order to adduce evidence in support of his defence. It was submitted that when the respondent had failed to even respond to the statutory notice and no evidence was adduced on his behalf to support his stand, the presumption under Sections 118 and 139 of the aforesaid Act operated in full force against the respondent. In the absence of any material placed on record by the respondent to rebut such presumption, the trial Court could not have acquitted the respondent. It was submitted that the contents of the complaint of the appellant ought to have been accepted by the trial Court and the respondent deserved to be convicted.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Per contra, Mr. V.N. Morande, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, submitted that even if there was presumption that cheque was issued for discharge of legal debt or liability, once the signature on the cheque was admitted, the appellant (complainant) was still required to prove foundational facts of his case. It was further submitted that when the appellant failed to prove such foundational facts regarding hand loan advanced to the respondent, the presumption under the said Act would not be triggered.  It was further submitted that even if presumption was to operate against the respondent, he was entitled to rebut the same on the basis of material brought on record by way of cross-examination of the appellant. It was submitted that in order to rebut the presumption, it was not necessary for the respondent to enter the witness box and that he could very well rebut the presumption by discrediting the appellant in cross-examination. Both parties placed reliance on various judgments pertaining to the said question.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  The position of law that emerges from the aforesaid precedents is that although presumption does arise against the accused in such cases under Sections 118 and 139 of the said Act, the presumption is rebuttable on the touchstone of preponderance of probabilities. The accused is also entitled to show that the foundational facts on which such presumption arises have not been proved by the complainant and further that the accused can rebut a presumption under the said provisions, either by adducing direct evidence in support of his stand or by discrediting the complainant in cross-examination to demonstrate that his defence was probable.  On the accused demonstrating the real facts of the matter either by direct evidence or by showing that the evidence and material placed on record by the complainant himself was not believable and that it stood discredited, the presumption would cease to operate against the accused. As per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court the presumption under Sections 118 and 139 of the said Act is rebuttable. The accused can throw the sunshine of actual facts and rebut the presumption that may arise. This can be done either by adducing direct evidence or on the basis of material placed on record by the complainant, including discrediting the complainant in cross-examination, thereby raising a probable defence. Applying the said position of law to the facts of the present case, it is found that the respondent (accused) failed to reply to the statutory notice sent by the appellant (complainant), he failed to file any reply or submissions in response to the complaint filed before the trial Court and he did not enter the witness box. Therefore, there was no direct evidence led by him to support his stand and he merely relied upon the evidence of the complainant as it emerged in cross-examination. In the present case, it was not disputed that the signatures on the cheques were that of the respondent. It was argued that the cross-examination of the appellant demonstrated that he had failed to support his case of having advanced cash hand loan to the respondent. It was further contended that the cross-examination also demonstrated that the cheques were issued for some other transaction and not for repayment of hand loan as claimed by the appellant. . A perusal of the evidence of the appellant shows that although in chief examination the appellant has reiterated the contents of his complaint to the effect that he had advanced cash hand loan of Rs. 2 lakhs to the respondent, but in cross-examination, the appellant has conceded that he was not aware about the details of when and in what manner he had given the cash hand loan amount to the respondent. He claimed to have withdrawn the cash amount from his bank accounts and that he was holding saving bank accounts in State Bank of India, Warud Branch and District Central Co-operative Bank, Warud Branch, but he stated that he was not able to produce the account statements of his bank accounts.  Thus, the appellant failed to produce any material in support of his claim that he had indeed advanced cash hand loan of Rs. 2 lakhs to the respondent. This was a foundational fact in the present case because according to the appellant the cheques in question had been issued by the respondent in order to repay the said loan amount. The appellant failed to discharge the initial burden to show that he had required funds for advancing money to the respondent.  In further cross-examination, the appellant admitted that although he had PAN number, he was not submitting income tax returns. He further admitted that he did maintain accounts but there was no entry in his accounts about having given loan of Rs. 2,00,000/- to the respondent. The appellant admitted that he had invested certain amounts in stocks and shares with one Anand Rathi, Stocks and Broker and that he had received certain amounts from the said Anand Rathi. There was a suggestion given to the appellant that the respondent had given the said cheques towards security till the time accounts with the said Anand Rathi were settled, but he denied the same. The appellant also denied the suggestion that he was doing transactions with Anand Rathi through the respondent.  A perusal of the aforesaid statements made in cross-examination by the appellant shows that he has completely failed to prove the foundational fact of having advanced loan to the respondent. Therefore, his claim that the cheques in question were issued by the respondent for repayment of the loan could not be accepted. The failure on the part of the appellant to produce his account statement and absence of entry in accounts maintained by him regarding loan advanced to the respondent, does show that there was no material to support the basic facts on which the entire case of the appellant was based.  Apart from this, suggestions given in the cross-examination and statements made in response thereto by the appellant, show that there were other transactions in respect of which there was exchange of moneys by the appellant. Applying the position of law as it emerges from the above quoted precedents to the facts of the present case, it becomes clear that sufficient material was available on record whereby the defence of the respondent became probable. In such a situation, the presumption under the provisions of the said Act ceased to operate and the burden fell upon the appellant to prove his case, which he failed to do by placing on record cogent evidence.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue in this case revolves around the interpretation of Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act in relation to a cheque issued by the respondent, which was dishonoured. The appellant contends that the respondent issued the cheque in discharge of a legally enforceable debt, thus making him liable under Section 138 of the Act. The Lower Court dismissed the complaint filed by the appellant and acquitted the respondent, based on the respondent's successful rebuttal of the presumption under Section 139 of the Act.\n\nUpon examination, it is clear that the Lower Court failed to consider the statutory presumptions that arose in favour of the appellant under Sections 118 and 139 of the Act. The respondent admitted to signing the dishonoured cheque, which should have triggered the statutory presumption that there was a legally enforceable debt in the appellant's favour. The Lower Court's conclusion that the respondent successfully rebutted the presumption under Section 139 is not supported by the evidence presented.\n\nFurthermore, the respondent's position that no loan was obtained from the appellant is contradicted by the loan application and meeting minutes presented by the appellant. The Lower Court's acceptance of this defence without further scrutiny is also questionable.\n\nGiven the undisputed signature of the respondent on the cheque, the predicates of Section 138 of the Act are clearly established. The Lower Court's judgment is therefore erroneous, and the appeal should be allowed. The respondent's acquittal should be set aside, and the case should be remanded for retrial in accordance with the provisions of Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act."

However, the petitioners had preferred the revision petition being Crl. Rev. No. 183/2016 before this court, which was dismissed as withdrawn on 09.03.2016  The factual matrix of the present case is that the complainant- respondent had filed a case against the petitioner on account of dishonour of cheques. According to the complaint, the petitioners had demanded loan of Rs.1 lac for business purpose, which the respondent gave on three different dates, i.e., Rs.17,000/- on 01.02.2007; Rs. 25,000/- on 17.02.2007; and Rs.20,000/- on 19.02.2007 and lastly Rs.38,000/- on 25.03.2007. An agreement was executed between the parties on 25.03.2007. . It is further alleged in the complaint that on 25.06.2007, the respondent demanded the amount back from the petitioners and the petitioners had issued two cheques for Rs.50,000/- each, which were dishonoured by the bank with the remark 'insufficient funds'. Legal notice was sent on 19.12.2007, which was replied by counsel for the petitioners. Thereafter, complaint under Section 138 of NI Act was filed by the respondent. Trial commenced. Complainant deposed himself in support of his case, as CW1 and the accused vide their statement recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. wish to lead defence evidence.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  The learned Metropolitan Magistrate has held the petitioners guilty for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as NI Act) and the petitioner No.1 has been sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for the period of three months and fine of Rs.1.5 lacs was also imposed upon petitioner No.1, however petitioner No.2 was sentenced to pay fine of Rs.50,000/-. Trial concluded and vide order dated 12.05.2015, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate held the petitioners guilty for the offence and vide order dated 19.05.2015, the petitioner No.1 was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months with fine of Rs.1.5 lacs for two cheques and petitioner No.2 was ordered to pay fine of Rs.50,000/- for 1 cheque. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of conviction and sentence, the petitioners preferred an appeal, which was dismissed by the learned Additional Session Judge vide order dated 25.02.2016 and while upholding the conviction and sentence passed by learned Metropolitan Magistrate, the petitioner No.1 was sent to judicial custody for serving the sentence, as awarded by the Trial Court.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Mr. Vivek Bhadauria, learned counsel for the petitioner contends that due to intervention of the common friends and well wishers, wishers, the disputes/differences between the parties have been amicably settled and to restore the harmony between the parties, they have decided to bury their all disputes and differences.  Lastly, counsel for the petitioner contended that since the matter has been amicably settled between the parties and the petitioners have already deposited a sum of Rs.5,000/- each to the State (totaling Rs.10,000/-) as fine, therefore it is contended that in the facts and circumstances of the present case the impugned order dated 25.02.2016 passed by learned Additional Session Judge be set aside and to give rest to the litigation between the parties, the present revision petition may be allowed and the order on sentence passed by learned Metropolitan Magistrate qua simple imprisonment for a period of 3 months, as imposed upon the petitioner no.1, be set aside.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Even the respondent is not willing to pursue the dispute further and he has given the statement before the court of learned Metropolitan Magistrate that he has amicably settled the matter with the petitioners and has also received the settled amount.  Mr. Ghanshyam Sharma, respondent is present in person and affirms the aforesaid contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner. He has further submitted that he has amicably settled the dispute with the petitioners and nothing remains due on him. He has also submitted that he has no objection if the impugned order on sentence is set aside and the petitioner No.1 is released from jail.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

I have also perused the material on record.  After considering the submission of the petitioner this court observes that the petitioner No.1 has been held guilty for the offence punishable under Section 138 of NI Act. It is also observed that the parties to the case have resolved their inter-se disputes and the respondent has also given his no objection to setting aside of the impugned order on sentence, and has no objection if the petitioner No.1 is released on bail.  The petitioners have also invoked the inherent powers of this court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and this court is conscious of the fact that the inherent powers of the High Court ought to be exercised to prevent the abuse of process of law and to secure the ends of justice. Mr. Ghanshyam Sharma, respondent has agreed to setting aside the order of sentence qua sentencing the petitioner No.1 for simple imprisonment for a period of three months and has also stated that the dispute between the parties has been settled out of his own free will. Considering the fact that the matter has been settled and compromised amicably, and the fact that the petitioner No.1 is in custody consequent upon the impugned order dated 25.02.2016 passed by learned Additional Session Judge, this Court is of the considered opinion that this is a fit case to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to secure the ends of justice.  The incorporation of inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is meant to deal with the situation in the absence of expressed provision of law to secure the ends of justice such as, where the process is abused or misused; where the ends of justice cannot be secured; where the process of law is used for unjust or unlawful object; to avoid the causing of harassment to any person by using the provision of Cr.P.C. or to avoid the delay of the legal process in the delivery of justice. Whereas, the inherent power is not to be exercised to circumvent the express provisions of law.  It is settled law that the inherent power of the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should be used sparingly. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Maharashtra through CBI v. Vikram Anatrai Doshi and Ors. 2014 ILO SC 637 and in the case of Inder Singh Goswami v. State of Uttaranchal has observed that powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. must be exercised sparingly, carefully and with great caution. Only when the Court comes to the conclusion that there would be manifest injustice or there would be abuse of the process of the Court if such power is not exercised, Court would quash the proceedings.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe core legal question in this case is whether the petitioner is guilty of an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, for issuing a dishonoured cheque to the complainant. The lower court found the petitioner guilty and convicted him accordingly. The arguments presented by the petitioner and respondent were primarily based on the compromise between the parties, with the petitioner agreeing to pay the cheque amount as compensation.\n\nIn assessing the lower court's judgment, we can apply the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, specifically Section 138, which requires that (a) the person drawing the cheque must have, (b) a legal right or valid claim on the person against whom the cheque is drawn, (c) a conduct indicating an intention to avoid payment of the amount of the cheque, and (d) the cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier.\n\nIn this case, it is clear that the cheque was dishonoured due to the account being closed. However, the key point is whether the petitioner had an intention to avoid payment of the amount of the cheque. The evidence presented by the respondent, in the form of a legal notice, establishes that the petitioner was aware of his legal liability. Furthermore, the compromise between the parties shows that the petitioner acknowledges the debt and agrees to pay it.\n\nGiven the evidence and the compromise between the parties, the petitioner's intention to avoid payment can no longer be inferred. Therefore, the lower court's judgment should be reversed.\n\nIn conclusion, the appeal should be allowed, and the conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner should be set aside. The compromise between the parties should be upheld, and the petitioner should be discharged from the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act."

Thus, it is argued that the second complaint filed by the complainant after the passing of the judgment dated 4.8.2016 by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narnaul, is very much maintainable and so is the summoning order passed therein. 5. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n2. Vide order dated 16.03.2017, this Court while issuing notice of motion, passed the following order:- \"Heard. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that a complaint was earlier filed by respondent for offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short NI Act), in which petitioner was convicted but the First Appellate Court acquitted him giving the benefit of observations of Apex Court in case of Yogendra Pratap Singh Vs. Savitiri Pandey, 2015 (1) RCR (Civil) 550 observing that the complaint was filed before the expiry of 15 days, after service of notice of the petitioner. Thereafter, the petitioner filed a complaint again before learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Narnaul along with application under Section 142 (b) of NI Act and the trial Court without considering the delay or passing any order condoning the delay in filing the complaint, has summoned the petitioner. Notice of motion for 18.05.2017. In the meanwhile, further proceedings in the complaint shall remain stayed till disposal of the application under Section 142 (b) of NI Act filed by the complainant. It is, however, made clear that if the application under Section 142 (b) of NI Act has already been decided or is decided after passing of this order, the trial Court will be at liberty to proceed further with the complaint.\"\n",
    "Case_Result": "From the aforesaid law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court, it is apparent that in a case where the complaint was filed before the expiry of the period 15 days stipulated in the notice required to be served upon the drawer of the cheque, the Court cannot take the cognizance thereof.However, the second complaint on the same cause of action has been held to be maintainable and the delay in filing such complaint shall be deemed to have been condoned.. In my opinion, the very object of laying down the law aforesaid was to curtail the practice of filing premature complaints. However, by granting liberty to file fresh complaints in the cases, where the complaints had already been filed without the expiry of the mandatory period of 15 days in terms of Section 138(c) of the Act, a balance has been struck so as to not make the complainant remediless.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9bcb\n**Facts**: The present petition has been filed by the petitioner/accused under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. praying this Court to set aside the order dated 23.06.2020 in C.C. No.307/2017 on the file of the Senior Civil Judge and JMFC, Nagamangala, Mandya and direct to refund the amount in deposit to the tune of Rs. 4,50,000/- to the petitioner unconditionally.  I have heard Sri. Bhargava D. Bhat, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri. Gourav G.K, learned counsel for the respondent virtually. The brief facts of the case are that respondent filed an application under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'NI Act'). In the complaint, the complainant filed an application under Section 143A of the NI Act and the said application was allowed and the petitioner is directed to deposit 20% of the cheque amount. It is further noticed that subsequently on 26.11.2019, the trial Court has passed an order of returning the complaint to the complainant to present it before the jurisdictional Court within thirty days. Thereafter, the present petitioner filed an application praying for refund of 10% of the cheque amount deposited by him as per the order under Section 143A of the NI Act.  Challenging the same, the petitioner is before this Court.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The trial Court after considering the said aspect has passed the impugned order with a condition that the applicant has to file an undertaking Affidavit that he will deposit the said amount of Rs. 4,50,000/- before the Additional Civil Judge and JMFC, Nagamangala. Further to submit PF and RPAD charges for giving information of order of the Court to the complainant.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Court which has passed the order has no jurisdiction and it has seized the jurisdiction to pass such a conditional order. It is his further submission that when the case has been transferred to file it before the jurisdictional Court, under such circumstances, the said order ought not to have been passed.  It is his further submission that the application filed under Section 143A of the NI Act itself is without taking any jurisdiction. The complaint has been registered on 02.12.2017 and the amendment to Section 143A of the NI Act has come into force on 01.09.2018 and in view of the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of G.J. Raja Vs. Tejraj Surana reported in 2019 SCC Online SC 989, the said order ought not to have been passed by giving retrospective effect. On these grounds, he prayed to allow the petition and to set aside the impugned order.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent vehemently argued and submitted that the order passed by the trial Court has been challenged by the petitioner in W.P. No.15440/2019 and this Court by order dated 30.05.2019 has passed an order to deposit 10% of the cheque amount and the said order has been passed by consensus of both the parties under such circumstances, the petitioner cannot contend that the Court ought not to have passed an order under Section 143A of the NI Act.  It is further submitted that the case has been transferred by returning the complaint and now the case has been presented before the jurisdictional Court and the proceedings are also pending in that Court. In that light, the trial Court is right in passing the impugned order. It is his further submission that the order passed under Section 143A of the NI Act has not been challenged, under such circumstances, the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is not sustainable in law. On these grounds, he prayed to dismiss the petition.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  I have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the learned counsel appearing for both the parties and perused the records. It is not in dispute that the respondent/complainant filed an application under Section 143A of the NI Act and the same has been challenged before this Court in W.P. No.15440/2019 and this Court by order dated 30.05.2019 has passed an order at paragraph No.4, which has been observed as under:  On going through the paragraph No.4 of the writ proceedings, it indicates that the said order has been passed on the consensus of the parties and the petitioner has agreed to deposit 10% of the cheque amount in that light, he has deposited Rs. 4,50,000/-. When the case has been transferred to the jurisdictional Court, under such circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that whatever the order, which has been passed, is not an ill-legal or an un-justifiable order. However, in order to meet the ends of justice, if the amount has been deposited to the tune of Rs. 4,50,000/-, if it is ordered to be deposited in any nationalized bank till the lis is concluded, no prejudice or injustice is going to be caused to either of the parties to the proceedings.  When the petitioner himself has undertaken to deposit 10% as ordered by the Court, then under such circumstances, now he cannot contend that the respondent/complainant has to file once again one more application before the jurisdictional Court for deposit of 20% or 10% of cheque amount. If any such orders are going to be passed, it is waste of judicial time and duplication of work. Once the amount has been deposited before the Court in a particular case, it must also go along with such case as it is the property in that case. Though it is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner by relying upon the decision in the case of G.J. Raja (quoted supra) that the said provision of law has come into force on 01.09.2018 and it cannot be given retrospective effect. But the said contention cannot be upheld in view of the order passed by this Court in the writ proceedings, the said contention is not sustainable in law.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe legal dispute in question centers around the validity of a second complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, after the petitioner had previously been acquitted on the same set of facts. The lower court's ruling was to issue notice and stay further proceedings in the complaint, pending the decision on the application under Section 142(b) of the NI Act.\n\nIn assessing the lower court's judgment, it must be noted that the acquittal of the petitioner was indeed on the grounds of the complaint being premature. Thus, the second complaint filed after the acquittal, with the benefit of time and additional evidence, is not in contravention of double jeopardy.\n\nFurther, the lower court's decision to stay further proceedings in the complaint, pending the decision on the application under Section 142(b) of the NI Act, adheres to the legal principle of protecting the petitioner from being tried twice for the same offense.\n\nIn conclusion, the appeal should be allowed, as the lower court's ruling to stay further proceedings in the complaint while deciding the application under Section 142(b) of the NI Act, is in line with the legal principles and the arguments presented by both parties."

    "JudgmentDate": "11/08/2020",
    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe revision petitioner is the accused. He issued a cheque dated 22.4.2006 to the complainant -respondent No.1, which was dishonoured. The dishonor memo is dated 25.4.2006. Thereafter, the complainant sent a notice dated 1.5.2006 demanding payment of the cheque amount but no response was received thereto. Hence, he filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act').  According to this certificate, the petitioner has undergone a total sentence of 01 year and 19 days including remission of 01 month and 10 days and there is no other criminal case pending/ decided against him. Based on the submissions made by the learned counsel, the only question which arises for adjudication in this case is whether the petitioner is entitled to reduction of his sentence. As has been mentioned earlier, the petitioner has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years which is the maximum sentence prescribed under the Act. While exercising revisional jurisdiction, the Court possesses exercises all the powers conferred on an Appellate Court as is evident from Section 401 (1) Cr.P.C. Section 386 Cr.P.C. confers powers on an Appellate Court to alter the nature or the extent or the nature and extent of the sentence. There is, thus, no doubt that the revisional Court can reduce the quantum of sentence. The question, however, is when such an exercise should be done? The judgements referred to by learned counsel for the petitioner do not throw any light on this issue. In Subhash Thakur (Supra), the sentence was reduced keeping in view the fact that the convict was a first offender and was the only bread winner of the family and had a large family to support. The fact that the convict had undergone a protracted trial, also weighed with the Court. Similarly, in Gurjant Singh (Supra), sympathetic considerations like the convict being a poor person and had suffered the agony of protracted trial have weighed with the Court. Similar is the case in Sumit Kumar (Supra). This gives rise to the question whether sympathetic considerations have any role to play in the matter of sentencing? Sentencing is primarily a matter of discretion as there are no statutory provisions governing the same. Even guidelines have not been laid down to assist the Courts in this matter. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that he does not press the revision petition on merits. He confines his prayer to reduction in the quantum of sentence. He submits that the petitioner is a poor person. He has undergone a protracted trial of almost 10 years. Further, he has undergone actual sentence of one year and 9 days. All these facts taken cumulatively entitle the petitioner to some leniency. Thus, the sentence be reduced to the period already undergone. So far as the compensation amount is concerned, the complainant - respondent No. 1 shall be at liberty to recover the same in accordance with law. He places reliance on some single Bench judgements of this Court which are Criminal Revision No.992 of 2016 Subhash Thakur versus State of Haryana and another, decided on 08.04.2016, Criminal Revision No. 4300 of 2017 Sumit Kumar versus Rajinder Kumar Nagpal and another, decided on 5.6.2018 and Criminal Revision No.3364 of 2015 Gurjant Singh versus Harpreet Singh, decided on 4.9.2019.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe submissions made by learned counsel for the petitioner have been vehemently opposed by the learned counsel appearing for the Complainant-respondent No. 1. He states that the petitioner has committed an offence under Section 138 of the Act and having done so, he deserves to undergo the complete sentence awarded by the learned trial Court. He does not deserve any leniency. Merely because he has undergone a protracted trial, does not entitle him to any benefit. No infirmity or illegality in the exercise of discretion by the trial Court has been pointed out and, thus, the petitioner does not deserve any relief. The revision petition merits dismissal. Learned State counsel has furnished the latest custody certificate of the petitioner dated 30.7.2020 and the same is taken on record.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe complaint was dismissed and the petitioner was acquitted vide judgement dated 25.02.2014. However, appeal against the said judgement was allowed on 20.10.2015 and the case was remanded for a fresh decision. Post remand, vide judgement dated 8.7.2016, the petitioner was convicted and sentenced to undergo rigourous imprisonment for a period of two years. He was also directed to pay compensation equal to the cheque amount along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of cheque till the date of the judgement. Appeal against the aforementioned judgement of conviction was dismissed vide judgement dated 21.8.2019 leading to the filing of the present revision petition.\n",
    "Case_Result": "From the aforementioned authoritative pronouncement, it is evident that the sentence imposed must be commensurate with the crime committed and in accordance with jurisprudential justification such as deterrence, retribution or restoration. Mitigating circumstances as well as aggravating circumstances should also be kept in mind. To determine the jurisprudential justification/principle which would apply in cases such as the instant one, it would be essential to examine certain statutory provisions. Chapter XVII comprising Sections 138 to 142 was inserted vide Amendment Act 66 of 1988 w.e.f. 1.4.1989. Section 138, as it stood at the time of its insertion, provided for a maximum sentence of one year or fine or both. Vide amending Act 55 of 2002, the maximum sentence was increased to two years and Sections 143 to 147 were inserted. Section 143 provides for summary trial by the Judicial Magistrate, Ist Class or the Metropolitan Magistrate provided the maximum sentence of one year is imposable and fine exceeding Rs.5000/-. For speeding up the process of trial, Section 144 provides for service of summons by speed post or approved courier services. Section 145 provides for submission of evidence on affidavit.The amended provisions reveal the legislative intent of expediting the trial and of making the sentence deterrent. Section 143-A and 148 were inserted vide amending Act 20 of 2018 providing for award of interim compensation at the trial stage and for deposit of minimum 20% of the compensation amount awarded, at the appellate stage.The concern of the Legislature is obvious. Provisions inserted for inculcating greater faith in banking transactions needed more teeth so that cases involving dishonour of cheques reduced. It is, thus, apparent that deterrence and restoration are the principles to be kept in mind for sentencing. At the same time, the Court cannot lose sight of the fact that the offence under Section 138 of the Act is quasi criminal in nature. Section 147 of the Act makes the offence compoundable notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It is not an offence against society and an accused can escape punishment by settling with the complainant. Thus, while imposing a sentence under Section 138 of the Act, the Court must be alive to the concern of the Legislature in inserting Chapter XVII in the Act and then amending the provisions thereof to make the same more stringent as well as the jurisprudential principles of deterrence and restoration and that the offence is quasi criminal in nature. The order of sentence is on record. Maximum sentence of rigorous imprisonment for two years has been imposed on the ground that the offence is a socio economic offence. No other consideration has weighed with the trial. Keeping in view the principle of restoration, compensation of payment of the cheque amount along with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of issuance of cheque till the date of the judgment has been awarded. The award of compensation is justified and reflects a judicious exercise of mind. Petition dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9a0c\n**Facts**: Though this petition is listed for admission, with consent of both parties, the matter is taken up for final disposal. Parties are referred to as per their status before the trial Court.  This revision petition has been preferred by accused aggrieved by judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 22.2.2019, passed by I Addl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Dharwad, in C. C.No.22/2018, convicting petitioner for the offence punishable under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('the Act' for short) and sentencing him to pay a fine of Rs. 4,52,000/-, in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months. Out of the fine amount, Rs. 4,51,000/- was ordered to be paid to complainant and Rs. 1,000/- was ordered to be paid to State.  Brief facts leading to filing of this revision petition are that, it is the case of complainant that himself and accused are well known to each other and due to their acquaintance and intimacy, accused received loan of Rs. 4,50,000/- from complainant and issued a cheque for Rs. 4,50,000/- towards repayment of loan vide cheque bearing No.319509 dated 11.8.2017.  On presentation of said cheque, the same came to be dishonoured for the reason 'funds insufficient' on 1.11.2017. Thereafter complainant got issued legal notice to accused on 13.11.2017. Despite service of notice to accused, no reply was sent and the amount so demanded was not repaid. Hence complainant filed a complaint under section 200 of Cr.P. C. for the offence punishable under section 138 of the Act. 6. After filing of complaint, cognizance was taken by the trial Court and on receipt of summons, accused appeared before the Court and pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried and accordingly he was tried. Thereafter complainant's sworn statement was recorded and it was treated as his evidence and he got marked Exs.P.1 to P.5 and closed his side.  Thereafter, statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P.C. was recorded. Accused denied all incriminating evidence against him, but he did not choose to cross examine complainant neither let-in evidence on his behalf Aggrieved by the said judgment, accused challenged the same before the District and Sessions Court in Crl. A. No.25/2019. On examining the material evidence placed before the Court and after re-appreciating the evidence on record, the appellate Court came to conclusion that accused is guilty of offence punishable under section 138 of the Act. Aggrieved by the judgment of conviction by trial Court and confirmation by appellate Court, accused is before this Court challenging the legality, correctness and validity of judgments of both the Courts.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  On challenge, the said judgment of trial Court has been confirmed by the Prl. District and Sessions Court, Dharwad, by judgment dated 1.7.2020 in Crl.A. No.25/2019.  On the basis of material evidence and documents produced by complainant, the trial Court came to a conclusion that complainant has proved necessary ingredients of section 138 of the Act and convicted accused for the offence punishable under section 138 of the Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 4,52,000/-. Appellate Court held that as per law Court is empowered to impose fine of double the amount of cheque. It has confirmed the judgment of trial Court and did not interfere with the same.  Thereafter, on 22.2.2019 judgment was pronounced by trial Court convicting accused for the offence punishable under section 138 of N.I. Act. Aggrieved by this judgment accused preferred an appeal.  On considering contentions of accused and relying on the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank Association (supra), appellate Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order passed by trial Court.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: . Learned counsel for petitioner contends that order of conviction passed by trial Court and confirmation of the same by appellate Court is not in accordance with law and opposed to principles of natural justice.  The same deserves to be set aside and an opportunity has to be provided to accused to defend his case effectively. It is further contended by learned counsel for petitioner that since no opportunity was provided to accused to cross examine PW.1/complainant, he was unable to confront the witness by producing material evidence in support of his case to disprove the case of complainant. 9. It is his contention that complainant has misused the cheque to make unlawful gain and the same was not issued for realization of any legally recoverable debt. He further contends that both the Courts have gravely erred in coming to a conclusion that case of complainant is proved beyond reasonable doubt despite not providing any opportunity to accused to rebut the presumption cast against him. Learned counsel further contends that the judgment of both Courts suffers from serious infirmities and on account of non providing sufficient opportunities to accused, the same deserves to be reversed. On these aspects learned counsel seeks to allow this revision petition and set aside the orders passed by both the Courts and to acquit petitioner.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Per contra, learned counsel for respondent contends that order passed by trial Court convicting accused and confirmed by appellate Court is in accordance with law and the materials placed on record. The same does not call for any interference. He contends that complainant has followed necessary procedure for adducing evidence and sufficient time was provided to accused to cross examine PW.1, but the same has not been utilized and rightly trial Court has convicted accused for the aforesaid offence. . Learned counsel further contends that intent of legislature is to dispose of the case pertaining to Negotiable Instruments Act within a period of six months in accordance with law. Trial Court accorded sufficient opportunity to accused to examine witnesses, but despite providing sufficient opportunity, the same was not utilized and hence convicted accused for the aforesaid offence which has been confirmed by appellate Court. Learned counsel for respondent contends that there is no illegality or perversity in the orders passed by trial Court and appellate Court. The same is in accordance with law and the precedent laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court for disposal of cases punishable under section 138 of the Act.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Heard Shri T.R.Patil, learned counsel for petitioner and Shri Praveen P. Tarikar, learned counsel for respondent. .. Having heard learned counsel for petitioner and respondent, a short point that arises for consideration is whether there is any illegality or perversity committed by the Court below in passing the impugned order. . During the course of arguments before this Court, learned counsel for petitioner has produced order sheet of trial Court to show that no opportunity was provided to him. On perusal of order sheet, it is seen that on 21.1.2019 accused appeared before trial Court, filed an application for grant of bail under section 436 of Cr.P. C.  The same was allowed and on the same day plea of accused was recorded, wherein accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Trial Court relying on the judgment of Hon' ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association and others vs. Union of India and others, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 590, treated the sworn statement of complainant as evidence, closed the side of complainant and recorded statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C. and posted the matter on 24.1.2019 for evidence of accused.  On 24.1.2019, both parties tried to settle the matter but same was unsuccessful and accordingly the matter was posted for accused evidence on 8.2.2019, on which date accused remained absent. Since no evidence was adduced by accused, the same was taken as nil and thereafter matter was posted for arguments on 16.2.2019.  On 16.2.2019 accused remained absent, no representation was made, arguments of accused were taken as nil and the matter was posted for judgment on 22.2.2019.  . During the course of arguments before this Court, learned counsel for petitioner has pleaded that he has a very good case on merit and if an opportunity is provided, he will be able to establish and rebut the presumption cast on him by disproving the case of complainant. Learned counsel has restricted his argument to remit the case back to trial Court for adjudication of the matter by providing an opportunity to adduce defence evidence.  It is seen in the orders passed on 21.1.2019 that trial Court has relied on a judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association (supra) and has rightly treated the sworn statement as evidence and thereafter recorded statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C. and posted the matter for defence evidence Thereafter matter was adjourned for two dates providing opportunity to accused to adduce evidence. Since no evidence was let-in by accused, the matter was posted for judgment, pursuant to which judgment was pronounced.  Considering the intent of legislature and the judgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association (supra), wherein guidelines have been laid down with regard to disposal of matters pertaining to Negotiable Instruments Act. It is seen that there is no illegality committed, per-se, in treating sworn statement as evidence and recording statement of accused under section 313 of Cr. P.C. on the same day and posting the matter for defence evidence.  As this is a summary trial, parties can adduce evidence by way of affidavit and there is nothing wrong in treating the sworn statement as evidence and recording statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C., on the same day. In the aforesaid judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court, it is held that, Courts must ensure examination-in-chief and cross-examination and re-examination of complainant to be conducted within three months and thereafter accused must examine witnesses and be available for cross-examination as and when directed by trial Court and there is no dispute that speedy and expeditious procedure should be adopted by trial Court dealing with the matters pertaining to section 138 of the N.I.Act.  In the present case on hand, during the course of arguments learned counsel for petitioner has submitted that an opportunity may be given to him to cross examine complainant and to lead his evidence for which conditions may be imposed by this Court and he is agreeable to deposit entire cheque amount within one month from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.  It is seen from records that the trial Court has followed the ratio and the principles laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank Association stated supra. But, what is to be seen here is whether in order to provide substantial justice to parties, an opportunity could be provided to accused by imposing certain conditions which should not be detrimental to the interest of the complainant. Learned counsel for the complainant consents to the matter being remanded to trial Court with a condition that accused deposits entire cheque amount and a specific time limit is provided for adducing evidence by accused and for conclusion of the case.  In such circumstances, in the interest of principle of natural justice and with an intention to provide an opportunity for accused to put forth his case by cross examining the complainant and by adducing his own evidence where no harm or grave injustice would be caused to complainant, the matter could be remanded back to trial Court. This Court is not subscribing to the lackadaisical attitude of accused in not availing opportunity provided by trial Court. Nevertheless, in the interest of principle of natural justice and to provide substantial justice to parties and with consent of counsel for the petitioner and counsel for respondent this matter could be remanded to trial Court for recording of evidence of accused and for cross examination of PW.1 complainant.\n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThis criminal revision is preferred against the following judgments and orders:- (i) Judgment and order dated 30.04.2009 passed in Criminal Case No.145 of 2007, Kailash Prasad vs. Prahlad Singh passed by the court of Judicial Magistrate, Purola, District Uttarkashi ('the case').  he factual matrix necessary for disposal of this revision is within a very short span. Respondent no.2 filed a complaint in the court of Judicial Magistrate, Purola, under Section 138 of the Act. According to it as Sale consideration of a property, the revisionist gave a cheque of Rs. 2,05,000/- to the respondent no.2. On 18.03.2007 the respondent no.2 presented the cheque in the bank for payment, but the cheque could not be honored, because meanwhile the revisionist had issued stop payment directions.  A notice was given but payment was not made, thereafter the complaint was filed. It is the basis of the case. In the case only complainant was examined and as stated, the revisionist was convicted and sentenced under Section 138 of the Act. This judgment and order dated 30.04.2009 was challenged in the appeal. But, the appeal was also dismissed. Both these judgments and order are impugned herein.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n4. Learned counsel for the revisionist would argue that the revisionist has already undergone the sentence, but the revisionist requests that the part of sentence by which the revisionist has been directed to pay compensation may be set aside. Learned counsel for the revisionist would raise a factual arguments that, in fact, the land, which was sold to the revisionist was a forest land.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n7. On behalf of respondent no.2, it is argued that the land which was sold by the respondent no.2 to the revisionist was recorded earlier in the name of respondent no.2 and after transfer it was recorded in the name of revisionist. 6. On behalf of the State counsel, it is argued that the revisionist had taken possession of the land, which was sold to him, therefore, it cannot be believed that any forest land was sold to him by the respondent no.2.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nBy this judgment and order the revisionist has been convicted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('the Act') and sentenced to one month's Simple Imprisonment and with a fine of Rs.5,000/-. It has further been directed that in default of payment of fine the revisionist would undergo Simple Imprisonment for a further period of Fifteen days'  In addition to it the revisionist has been directed to pay Rs.2,05,000/- (Rupees Two Lakh Five Thousand) as compensation to the respondent no. 2, which was the amount of cheque., and (ii) Judgment and order dated 07.03.2011, passed in Criminal Appeal No.19 of 2009, Prahlad Singh vs. Kailash Prasad and another, by the court of Sessions Judge, Uttarkashi, (the appeal). By this, the judgment and order dated 30.04.2009 passed in the case has been confirmed.\n",
    "Case_Result": "8. Whatever, arguments have been advanced, they relate to the factual aspects of the case. It is a revision. The scope of revision is much restricted to the extent of examining correctness, legality or proprietary of the judgment. In fact, evidence cannot be appreciated in the revisions, but under certain circumstances, for example, if the material evidence is ignored; irrelevant material has been considered or perversity has occurred, the evidence may be looked into. Here, in this case nothing has been shown that any irrelevant material has been considered or material evidence has been ignored or any perversity has occurred. In fact, what is argued on behalf of the revisionist is with regard to appreciation of the available material, which cannot be done in the revision.9. The perusal of the judgment in case dated 30.04.2009 reveals that the learned court below has considered all the aspects of the matter and found that the case has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. In the appeal the arguments on factual aspects were raised, which has been discussed by the court below. Petition allowed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9883\n**Facts**: The present respondent had instituted a complaint against the present revision petitioner under S.200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter, for brevity referred to as 'the N.I. Act') in the Court of XV Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore City.  The summary of the case of the complainant in the Trial Court is that the accused had borrowed a sum of `9,35,000/- from him on 03.05.2002 and had executed an 'on demand promissory note' and consideration receipt. The loan was taken by the accused for the improvement of his business. Towards the return of the loan amount, the accused had issued a cheque dated 06.09.2004 in favour of the complainant for a sum of `9,35,000/-, drawn on Jammu and Kashmir Bank Ltd., OTC Road Branch, Bengaluru.  When the said cheque was presented by the complainant the same came to be dishonoured by the banker's endorsement as 'funds insufficient'. Since the accused did not repay the cheque amount even after serving a legal notice dated 17.09.2004 upon him, the complainant was constrained to file the complaint before the Court. The accused appeared through his counsel and contested the matter. In order to prove the alleged guilt against the accused, complainant himself got examined as PW-1 and got marked documents at Exs.P1 to P9. The accused got himself examined as DW-1 and got examined one Prakash Chand as DW-2 and got marked documents at Exs.D1 to D13. It is challenging the said Judgment of conviction and Order on sentence, the accused has preferred this revision petition. The respondent is being represented by his learned counsel.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The Trial Court by its Judgment dated 22.04.2008 convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and passed the Order on sentenc After hearing arguments from both side, the Trial Court by its impugned Judgment of conviction and Order on sentence dated 22.04.2008, convicted the accused for the offence punishable under S.138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him accordingly. Aggrieved by the same, the accused preferred an appeal before the learned Sessions Judge, City Fast Track Court - VII, Bangalore City in Criminal Appeal No.422/2008, which Court, after hearing both side, by its considered Judgment dated 26.10.2010, dismissed the appeal by confirming the Judgment of conviction passed by the Trial Court. \n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the revision petitioner in his arguments submitted that the money transaction was between the accused and the father of the complainant but never such a transaction has taken place between the accused and the complainant. During the said money transaction, the father of the complainant used to collect blank cheques from the accused. However he failed to return some of the cheques even though the loans were re-paid, on the pretext that the cheques were misplaced by him and he would return the same later. Further, he, joined by his son who is the complainant has misused one such cheque by presenting the same in the name of the complainant and instituting a false complaint through the said son. Learned counsel further submitted that the said father has been examined by the accused as DW-2 who has admitted the financial transaction between him and the accused. This supports the contention of the accused that the financial transaction was with DW-2 but not with the accused. Learned counsel also submitted that when the complainant says that the loan was given through a cheque which was got encashed by the accused, nothing had prevented him from producing the statement of bank account. However, by not producing the same, he has failed to prove the alleged loan transaction. He concluded his arguments by submitting that, had really such a loan transaction been taken place between the complainant and the accused, the said complainant would have definitely demanded either the repayment of the loan or interest on the alleged loan amount from the date of alleged loan transaction till the date of filing of the complaint which was nearly for a period of two years. The inaction on the part of the complainant also raises suspicion with respect to the alleged loan transaction.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent - complainant, in his brief arguments submitted that it is an admitted fact that the complainant and accused were known to each other. Though DW-2 is father of the complainant, but by that itself, it cannot be considered that there was no power for the son to lend money to the accused. He also submitted that issuance of the cheque and the hand- writing upon the cheque have all been admitted by the accused himself.  In such a situation, the legal presumption under S.139 of the N.I. Act operates in favour of the complainant. The said presumption coupled with trustworthy evidence of PW-1 has clearly proved the loan transaction and the non re-payment of the loan by the accused. As such, both the Courts below have rightly appreciated the evidence led before it and have convicted the accused for the alleged guilt.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  Heard arguments from both side. Perused the materials placed before the Court. The complainant in his evidence as PW-1 in the examination-in-chief itself has stated that the alleged loan given to the accused was through a cheque bearing No.408387 dated 03.05.2002 drawn on Canara Bank, Chickpet Branch, Bengaluru. The same was duly encashed by the accused. He has also stated that after repeated demands and personal approaches made by him to the accused, the accused towards the repayment of the loan amount had issued to him the cheque in question for a sum of `9,35,000/- on 06.09.2004. It is the said cheque which came to be dishonoured when presented for realisation, as such, he got issued a legal notice dated 17.09.2004 to the accused under 'registered post with acknowledgement due' and as well under 'certificate of posting'. He has also stated that the notice issued under registered post returned to the sender with a postal shara \"not claimed\". However, the notice sent under certificate of posting since has not been returned to the sender, the same is presumed to be served upon him. Further, the accused did not reply or respond to the said notice. Though PW-1 was cross-examined from the accused' side in detail, but nowhere in the cross- examination the accused has disowned the cheque in question. On the other hand, he has elicited some more details about the alleged transaction including that the accused was a building contractor and he had business transactions with his father (father of the complainant). The witness has also stated that the accused had approached him one week prior to the advancement of money to him and the said loan transaction took place in the office of the complainant in one afternoon.  The witness has also stated that the accused was acquainted with him since he was visiting his father. These details given by PW-1 since have further remained undenied or undisputed, the fact remains that the accused and complainant were acquainted with each other and as such they were not strangers. It also further goes to show that the accused had financial transactions with the father of the complainant. The said finding also gets supported from the evidence of DW-2 who is none else than the father of the complainant. The said witness has admitted suggestion that the accused had business transactions with him and in that regard, he was issuing money to the accused through cheques.  Thus the financial transaction between the father of the complainant and the accused has been admitted by the accused himself in his evidence. Further, DW-2 has categorically denied that the alleged cheque in question was a blank cheque collected by him from the accused and the same was misused in the name of his son i.e. the complainant.  DW-2 also specifically denied a suggestion that the alleged financial transaction was only between himself and the accused and that there was no transaction between his son / complainant and the accused. By stating so, DW-2 has also shown that the alleged financial transaction was not confined between himself and the accused but there was such a transaction between the complainant and the accused also. The accused who got himself examined as DW-1 has stated that, in his transaction with DW-2 who is the father of the complainant, a blank cheque duly signed by him and an 'on demand promissory note' were given by him to the father of the complainant. By stating so, he has shown that he was in the habit of borrowing money by executing 'on demand promissory notes' and was issuing cheques. The said statement of DW-1 would rather support the contention of the complainant that accused was acquainted with him and, at the demand of the accused, he had financially assisted the accused by lending loan in which regard the accused had executed an 'on demand promissory note' and towards repayment of the loan also issued a cheque which is in question herein. DW-1 in the very same examination-in-chief, has nowhere denied the issuance of the cheque in question.  Further he has taken a contention that he had handed-over the said cheque to the father of the complainant during the year 2002. When the accused has not denied the issuance of the cheque but has taken a contention that the said cheque was issued to somebody else but not to the payee or holder of the instrument, then it is for him to establish that the cheque was issued to a different person but not to the complainant. In the instant case, the accused as DW-1 while taking such a vague contention has not produced any corroborative evidence to prove his contention. On the contrary, the very same accused in his cross-examination has stated that as a builder, he develops land for which he raises loans from banks and several individuals. Thus, he has shown that he is a regular borrower not just from the father of the complainant but from banks and other individuals also. Further in the very same cross-examination, when he was confronted with the cheque which was marked at Ex.P4, he has admitted that the said cheque pertains to him and admitted a suggestion as true that the amount mentioned in the cheque is in his hand-writing.  He also stated that for the alleged non- return of the cheque in question by the father of the complainant, he has not taken any legal action against him. With these admissions and the statements made by DW-1 in his cross-examination coupled with evidence of PW-1 and DW-2 it clearly goes to show that the complainant both by his oral and documentary evidence has clearly established that the cheque in question was issued to him by the accused towards the repayment of the loan amount which is said to have been taken by the accused, from him. Merely because the complainant has not produced his bank passbook or statement, by that itself, it cannot be suspected that there was no such loan transaction. The oral and documentary evidence led by the complainant and the admissions made by the accused in his cross-examination and also the non denying of the submissions of PW-1 in his cross- examination would clearly go to establish that the accused had availed a loan of `9,35,000/- from the complainant and towards the repayment of the same, he had issued the cheque marked at Ex.P4.  Thus, apart from a mere legal presumption under S.139 of N.I. Act, the complainant's evidence further crystalises the said presumption and proves it to be a fact. . Admittedly the said cheque at Ex.P4 came to be dishonoured with the reason of 'insufficiency of funds' as could be seen from the banker's endorsement which is at Ex.P5. Though the legal notice sent to the accused by the complainant as per Ex.P8 came to be returned to the sender as at Ex.P8(a), the postal shara is that the 'article was not claimed'. Thus when it is not claimed despite the tender made to an addressee, it is deemed that the addressee is served with the said article. Otherwise, he would not have remained not claiming the notice. Simultaneously the complainant has also shown that he has sent the said notice under 'certificate of posting' as could be seen from Ex.P7. The said notice sent under certificate of posting is said to have been not returned to the complainant.  As such, the notice sent under certificate of posting can also be deemed as having been delivered to the addressee / accused. Thus, even after service of such a notice, the accused has not responded to the same in any manner.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe criminal revision is against the judgments and orders passed in the case of Kailash Prasad vs. Prahlad Singh under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The main issue of the case is whether the judgment of the lower court, convicting the revisionist for dishonoring a cheque, is correct. The revisionist's argument is that the land sold was a forest land and hence the conviction is incorrect. The respondent's argument is that the land sold was recorded in the revisionist's name and he took possession of it. \n\nThe lower court convicted the revisionist under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and sentenced him to simple imprisonment for one month and a fine of Rs.5,000. In default of payment of fine, the revisionist was to undergo simple imprisonment for a further period of fifteen days. Additionally, the revisionist was directed to pay Rs.2,05,000 as compensation to the respondent. \n\nOn appeal, the Sessions Judge confirmed the judgment of the lower court. \n\nThe revisionist argues that the land sold was a forest land and hence the conviction is incorrect. The respondent argues that the land was recorded in the revisionist's name and he took possession of it. \n\nUnder section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, a person is deemed to have committed an offence who, \"...draws or utters a cheque for payment of any amount of money to the credit of any person from an account maintained by him in a bank or other institution ...\" knowing that he has not sufficient funds to honour the cheque on  presentation. The burden is on the complainant to prove that the accused had insufficient funds in the account from where the cheque was drawn and that he issued the cheque knowing it will bounce. \n\nIn the present case, the cheque was for the sale consideration of a property. The respondent has examined himself and proved that the revisionist had not made the payment despite issuing a notice. The revisionist has not led any evidence to prove that he had sufficient funds in his account at the time of issuing the cheque or that he believed he had sufficient funds to honour the cheque. \n\nHence, the revisionist is rightly convicted under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. However, the sentence of simple imprisonment is excessive for a first-time offender. The revisionist has already undergone the sentence and he is directed to pay compensation of Rs.2,05,000 to the respondent. \n\nIn conclusion, the appeal is allowed to the extent that the sentence of simple imprisonment is set aside and the revisionist is directed to pay a compensation of Rs.2,05,000 to the respondent. The rest of the judgment is maintained."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nA brief resume of background facts in the context of Writ Petition (Cri.W.P. No. 497/2008) may be stated. The petitioner and the respondent - M/s Videocon Industries Ltd. were having transactions. The petitioner is proprietor of M/s Monisha Agency. The respondent is a multinational Company. One of its branch office is at Bhubaneshwar. The petitioner used to purchase goods from the respondent's branch at Bhubaneshwar. The petitioner allegedly issued a cheque dated 05-06-2006 for Rs. 3, 00, 000/- (rupees three lacs) in favour of Videocon International Ltd. The cheque was drawn on UCO Bank. The cheque was presented by the respondent in State Bank of India, Ahmednagar for encashment. It was sent by the said Bank to the drawee Bank i.e. UCO Bank, branch at Tangi (Orissa) for realization.  The cheque was dishonoured by the payee Bank with remark \"funds insufficient\". The respondent issued demand notice dated 22-11-2006 to the petitioner by registered post. Inspite of service of the notice, the payment was not made within 15 days. Consequently, the respondent instituted a private complaint case (S.T.C. No. 8704/2006) against the petitioner for commission of offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The petitioner filed an application (Exh-20) to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction . In both the criminal complaint cases, similar applications were submitted by the respondent - Smt. Manisha for dismissal of the complaint cases on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe petitioner contended before the learned Magistrate that his place of business is at Chandpur (Orissa). The transactions were with branch of the respondent (complainant) at Bhubneshwar (Orissa). The cheque was issued at Chandpur (Orissa) and was dishonoured within the territorial jurisdiction of the Criminal Court at Khurda (Orissa) or Bhubaneshwar, but on basis of fake cause of action, the criminal complaint was instituted in the Court at Ahmednagar. 1. Mr. Jadhavar, advocate, however, would submit that the cheque was issued within territorial jurisdiction of the Courts at Khurd, it was payable to the office of the drawer at Bhubaneshwar (Orissa) and the goods were delivered from said office which is the appropriate place where the complaint could have been filed.  He would submit that mere presentation of the cheque at Ahmednagar Bank of the drawee will not give cause of action to file the complaint at Ahmednagar. He would further submit that place of sending the notice is also not the place where cause of action could arise.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nBy filing the criminal revision applications, the original complainant challenges the orders dated 8th October, 2007 rendered by the learned Judicial Magistrate (F.C.) whereby return of the complaints to him is directed, holding that the Court at Ahmednagar has no territorial jurisdiction to deal with the same.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n The learned Judicial Magistrate held that part of cause of action arose within jurisdiction of Ahmednagar Court. The learned Judicial Magistrate noticed that the payment was demanded under the demand notice from the petitioner at the branch office situated at Ahmednagar and, therefore, the complaint was maintainable within the jurisdiction of Ahmednagar. The application was accordingly rejected.  The learned Judicial Magistrate held that no cause of action arose within the jurisdiction of the Court at Ahmednagar and, therefore, directed return of the complaint cases under section 201 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to the complainant for presentation of the same at the appropriate Court having jurisdiction to entertain the complaints. By filing criminal writ petition, the original accused in the criminal complaint case bearing S.T.C. No. 8704/2006 challenges the order dated 31st July, 2008 whereby the learned Judicial Magistrate rejected his application for dismissal of the complain\n",
    "Case_Result": ". In the context of the two (2) revision applications, noted above, it may be stated that two (2) different cheques were issued by the respondent Smt. Manisha, who is proprietor of M/s Kalyani Agency, Bhubaneshwar. The original complainant M/s Kitchen Appliances (India) Ltd. is the revision applicant of both the revision applications. The cheques were drawn on United Bank of India, branch at Khurda (Orissa). They were presented by the complainant at State Bank of India, Ahmednagar branchThey were sent to the payee Bank. Both the cheques were dishonoured due to insufficiency of funds in the account of the respondent. Then, demand notices were issued on 27-06-2007 through an advocate from Ahmednagar. The respondent gave reply dated 17-07-2007. The non-payment of the demanded amount at Ahmednagar, according to the complainant, gave cause of action to file the criminal complaints (S.T.C. No. 3824/2007 and S.T.C. No. 3825/2007).9. Heard learned counsel for the parties. Common thread of arguments advanced by Mr. Pallod, advocate and Mr. Dixit, Senior Advocate is that the payment was to be received at Ahmednagar where the cheque was presented, the notice of demand was issued from Ahmednagar and the drawer of the cheque was called upon to make the payment at Ahmednagar and the dishonour was communicated there which give rise to cause of action within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court at Ahmednagar. There is no dispute about the fact that the transactions pertaining to delivery of goods did not take place within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court at Ahmednagar. The five (5) acts stated above need not, ofcourse, take place at the same place. The cause of action is a bundle of facts. It is well settled that cause of action may arise at two (2) different places having regard to commission of any particular act by the offender. The scope of section 177 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 would encompass within its fold, such several places where parts of the cause of actions may arise.13. To begin with, I shall proceed to examine whether mere presentation of the cheque in question at Ahmednagar would give cause of action to the Court there. The cheque was admittedly issued on the Bank having branch at Tangi/Khurda (Orissa).hus, the payment was to be cleared by the said Bank. The presentation of cheque cannot be at the whim of the holder of the cheque. The above observations would make it manifest that the expression\"the bank\" referred to in clause (a) to the Proviso to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 would mean the drawee Bank on which the cheque is drawn and not any other Bank. Obviously, mere presentation of the cheque in question in the Bank of the payee at Ahmednagar is of no consequence The argument of the learned advocate Mr. Pallod and learned senior advocate Mr. Dixit, on this score, is, therefore, unacceptable. The presentation of the cheques in question at Ahmednagar by itself cannot be a cause of action available within the territorial jurisdiction of that Court.It is important to note that there is no written agreement between the parties to pay the amounts shown under the cheques in question at Ahmednagar. The cheques were not drawn on the Bank office at Ahmednagar. The mere fact that notice was issued from Ahmednagar would not clothe the jurisdiction on the Court of Judicial Magistrate at Ahmednagar.As stated before, the receipt of the notice and non-payment of the demanded amounts are ingredients which will have precedence over the place wherefrom the notice of demand was issued. Therefore, the Court of Judicial Magistrate at Ahmednagar cannot have jurisdiction to entertain the complaints.The averments in the complaint that the Company carries on business at Ahmednagar is of no much relevance in the fact situation of the present case. It need not be emphasized that the head office of both the Companies is at Mumbai. The goods were delivered by the branch offices situated at Bhubneshwar. The cheques were issued and drawn on branch of the Bank at Tangi/Khurda (Orissa). The demand notice was served on the concerned accused at the places situated in Orissa State Petitions Disposed of",

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue of the case is whether the lower court correctly ruled that the criminal complaint filed at Ahmednagar has territorial jurisdiction, given the circumstances that the cheque was issued in Orissa and dishonoured within the jurisdiction of the courts at Khurd or Bhubaneswar.\n\nIn this case, the lower court erred in its interpretation of the law. While the complainant argues that the place of sending the demand notice at Ahmednagar gives jurisdiction to the court there, this is not supported by the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. The relevant sections, 138 and 141, do not specify any particular place for filing a complaint.\n\nAdditionally, the evidence presented does not support the lower court's ruling. The cheque was issued in Orissa and dishonoured within the jurisdiction of the courts at Khurd or Bhubaneswar. The demand notice was also sent from Orissa. Therefore, the appropriate place for filing the complaint would be at Khurd or Bhubaneswar, not Ahmednagar.\n\nBased on this assessment, I conclude that the appeal should be allowed, and the lower court's decision should be overturned. The complaint should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction at Ahmednagar."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n The facts of these three applications are more or less similar. Hence, for the sake of convenience, I am referring to the facts in Criminal Application No.1170 of 2008. The applicants are the accused in a complaint filed by the first respondent alleging commission of offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"the said Act of 1881\").  The prayer in this application is for recall of the said order dated 28th July 2008 and for a direction to place the application for leave for re-hearing. As the learned Judge who passed the order dated 28th July 2008 is not available at Mumbai, by administrative order dated 26th November 2008, these applications were ordered to be placed before the regular Court.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n The learned counsel for the applicant submitted that a special leave under sub section 4 of section 378 of the said Code of 1973 cannot be granted without giving an opportunity of being heard to the accused. His submission is that grant of leave results in admission of the appeal against acquittal which is invariably followed by an action under section 390 of the said Code of 1973.  He submitted that by grant of leave and admission of an appeal against acquittal, the rights of the accused are vitally affected and, therefore, it was necessary for this Court to have issued a notice to the applicants before granting the leave.  He submitted that the Apex Court has repeatedly held that when an authority takes an action by which rights of an individual are affected, the principles of natural justice will have to be read in the statutory provisions. He submitted that the Apex Court has now held that the principle of natural justice \"audi alteram partem\" apply even to the administrative orders having the civil consequences. He submitted that as the rule of \"audi alteram partem\" has to be read in the statute under which a quasi judicial authority or an administrative authority passes an order involving civil consequences, surely the said rule will have to be read in sub section 4 of section 378 of the said Code of 1973 while this Court exercises the power of grant of special leave. He submitted that section 378 itself makes a distinction between a leave which is granted in an appeal preferred by the State and a special leave which is required to be granted for preferring an appeal against the acquittal by a complainant in a private complaint. He invited my attention to the provisions of section 473 of the said Code of 1973 which confers power on the Court to extend the period of limitation.  Lastly he submitted that this Court could not have passed an order directing an action under section 390 of the said Code of 1973. He submitted that it is not mandatory in every case where special leave or leave has been granted under section 378 of the said Code of 1973 to direct that an action under section 390 of the said Code of 1973 should be initiated. He submitted that in the case of an appeal against an order of acquittal for offence punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, it is not at all necessary to issue a direction for action under section 390 of the said Code of 1973. He submitted that the result of mechanically passing an order for an action under section 390 of the said Code is that a warrant will be executed against the accused who is already acquitted and in a given case he may be detained though the offence for which he was prosecuted may be a non cognizable and bailable offence. He, therefore, submitted that atleast that part of the direction issued by this Court directing an action under section 390 of the said Code of 1973 be set aside or recalled The learned counsel for the applicants submitted that on the basis of action under section 390, there are cases where an accused who is acquitted is put behind the bars as he is not enlarged on bail. Section 390 contemplates that when action is taken under section 390, the accused can be arrested and brought before this Court or any subordinate Court\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe learned counsel for the first respondent opposed the prayer by submitting that once a leave is granted and the appeal is admitted, there is no power under the said Code of 1973 vesting in this Court for reviewing or recalling its own order. He submitted that even by exercising the power under section 482 of the said Code, the aforesaid order of this Court granting leave cannot be recalled.  He submitted that an appeal against the acquittal is available on law as well as on facts and, therefore, this Court has rightly granted the leave. He submitted that action under section 390 of the said Code has already been completed and the applicants have furnished bail and, therefore, now it is not necessary to interfere with that part of the order. He fairly stated that the first respondent had not prayed for an action under section 390 of the said Code, however, this Court thought it fit to issue such a direction. He submitted that no interference is called for.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe learned Magistrate acquitted the applicants in this application. The first respondent filed Criminal Application no.2081 of 2008 in this Court invoking sub section 4 of section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as \"the said Code of 1973\"). The said application was heard on 28th July 2008. This Court granted leave and admitted the appeal. This Court directed that an action be taken under section 390 of the said Code of 1973. \n",
    "Case_Result": "The submissions of the learned counsel for the parties have been heard. I have carefully considered the submissions. The well established legal position is that as far as an admission of the appeal is concerned, it is always a matter between the Appellate Court and the appellant. A respondent to the appeal has no right of hearing at the stage of admission. It is only when the Appellate Court thinks it fit to issue a notice before admission or a show cause notice calling upon the respondent to show cause as to why the appeal shall not be admitted, the respondent can claim a right of being heard at the stage of admission of the appeal. Under section 378(1) of the said Code a Public Prosecutor can present an appeal to the Court of Sessions from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence. Under the same sub-section it is provided that the State Government may in any case direct the public prosecutor to present an appeal to the High Court from original or appellate order of acquittal passed by any Court other than the High Court (not being an order passed on an appeal preferred against acquittal to the Court of Sessions) or order of acquittal passed by the Court of Sessions in revision. Sub section 3 provides that an appeal to the High Court under sub section 1 of section 378 shall not be entertained except with the leave of the High Court. Sub section 4 provides that if such an order of acquittal is passed in any case instituted upon a complaint, the complainant is entitled to apply to the High Court for grant of special leave to appeal from the order of acquittal.When a public prosecutor desires to appeal against an order of acquittal, he has to apply for grant of leave and when a complainant in private complaint desires to appeal against an order of acquittal, he has to apply for a special leave. Grant of leave or special leave by this Court may result in admission of the appeal against acquittal. Leave or special leave is granted by this Court after examining the merits of the case. Leave or special leave is granted when a case is made out by the applicant. Section 385 of the said Code provides that when an appeal against acquittal is not dismissed summarily by this Court, the Court is enjoined to cause notice of the time and place at which such an appeal will be heard to be given to the accused. Clause (a) of section 386 of the said Code provides that in an appeal from order of acquittal, the Appellate Court may reverse such an order and direct that further enquiry be made or that the accused be retried or committed for trial, as the case may be, or find him guilty and pass sentence on him according to law.Thus, from the scheme of the provisions of Chapter-XXIX of the said Code, it appears that after grant of leave or special leave, if an appeal against acquittal is not summarily dismissed, under section 385 of the said Code this Court is enjoined to issue notice of the hearing of the appeal to the accused. As stated earlier, the law is well settled. There is no right of audience available to a respondent at the stage of admission of an appeal and the admission of an appeal is always a matter between the appellant and the Court. An order admitting an appeal against the order of acquittal is not an adverse order against an accused. Grant of leave or special leave precedes the admission of an appeal. If a respondent has no right of audience at the stage of admission of an appeal against the order of acquittal, it is not possible to say that he has a right of hearing at the stage of grant of leave or special leave. It is, therefore, very difficult to accept the submission of the learned counsel for the applicant that the principles of natural justice or principles of audi alterem partem will have to be read in sub section 3 and sub section 4 of section 378 of the said Code of 1973 so as to give right of hearing to a respondent-accused at the stage of grant of leave or at the stage of admission of an appeal against acquittal.Reliance placed by the learned counsel for the applicants on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of State of Maharashtra vs. Sharadchandra Vinayak Dongre and others (supra) will be of no help to the applicants. The Apex Court was dealing with the power of the Criminal Court under section 473 of the said Code of 1973 to extend the period of limitation or to condone the delay. Right of hearing to the opposite party in such a case has been read in the statute. The reason is that by virtue of lapse or expiry of period of limitation provided under the said Code of 1973, a right is accrued in favour of the accused and, therefore, before the delay is condoned and/or the period of limitation is extended, the accused is required to be heard. Similarly, the decision of the Apex Court in the Case of Mangilal (supra) will not help the applicant as the question therein was as regards grant of compensation under section 357 of the said Code.Thus, the conclusion is that no right of hearing can be read in the said Code in favour of an accused at the stage of grant of leave or special leave under sub section 3 or sub section 4 of section 378 of the said Code of 1973. No right of hearing in favour of an accused can be read into the statute while this Court considers the question of admission of an appeal against acquittal. An accused is entitled to notice only under section 385 of the said Code after this Court comes to the conclusion that the appeal cannot be summarily dismissed by exercising the power under section 384 of the said Code. It is needless to say that this Court always has a discretion of issuing a notice before admission or a show cause notice on application for grant of leave or special leave wherever this Court desires that the accused should be heard. In such a case naturally the accused will get audience before grant of leave and admission of the appeal. Therefore, the first submission made by the counsel for the applicants will have to be rejected.11. In the present case it is pointed out that an action under section 390 of the said Code has been already taken and the applicants have already furnished bail bonds. Nevertheless, I am dealing with the legal submissions made by the counsel appearing for the applicant. The section uses the word \"may\" which indicates that this Court has a discretion either to direct an action under section 390 of the said Code of 1973 or not to direct such an action. Only by way of an illustration a reference can be made where an appeal against acquittal is filed against an order of acquittal of the accused under section 138 of the said Act of 1881. The offence is a bailable offence. In a given case where this Court finds that the accused has a fixed place of residence and that he has regularly attended the Trial Court and has co-operated for trial, it may not necessary to initiate an action under section 390 of the said Code.There are cases where a respondent-accused is represented by an advocate in an appeal against acquittal who after admission of an appeal waives service of notice of appeal. In such a case, it may not be necessary for this Court to pass an order directing an action under section 390 of the said Code. The exercise of discretion will depend on combination of various factors.In a given case when an appeal against an order of acquittal is placed for final hearing and the Court finds that the presence of the accused is necessary, even at that stage also this Court can exercise the power under section 390 of the said Code of 1973. Thus, the power under section 390 of the said Code of 1973 can be exercised at any stage during the pendency of an appeal against acquittal.The section further provides that the Court before which he is brought may commit him to prison pending the disposal of the appeal or admit him to bail. Thus, when pursuant to an action under section 390 of the said Code, an accused is brought before a subordinate Court, the said Court has ample power to enlarge the accused on bail. On plain reading of the section it is obvious that the concerned Court subordinate to this Court need not be under an impression that merely because an order is passed by this Court of issuing warrant, the accused should not be admitted to bail and he should be taken in custody. The said Court has a power to admit the accused to bail. When an accused is brought before a Court subordinate to this Court on the basis of an action under section 390 of the said case, normally the accused should be enlarged on appropriate bail unless there are extraordinary circumstances or unless there is a direction of this Court to that effect. The subordinate Court before which the accused is produced must keep it in mind that the accused produced before it is already acquitted.17. It is unfortunate that the Registry of this Court has not implemented the second direction issued by this Court of placing the appeals against acquittal after report is received from the Trial Court as regards the action under section 390 of the Code. Even the first direction issued to the Subordinate Courts to bring it to the notice of the accused of his right to apply for bail is not being implemented. Applications dismissed",

Complainant closed her case. A date was fixed for examination of the defence witness and argument on 10.04.2006. However, the appellant filed an application for cross-examination of the complainant herself which was rejected. A revision application was filed thereagainst in the Court of the Sessions Judge. In the said revision application, no order of stay was passed. Whereas the appellant had continuously remained present before the Trial Judge, the complainant remained absent. 4. On or about 18.04.2006, the appellant filed an application for his acquittal on the ground of absence of the complainant.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  Leave granted. Appellant was being prosecuted in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai for alleged commission of an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'the Act') on the basis of a complaint petition filed by the respondent herein. By an order dated 24.04.2006, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate acquitted the accused under Section 256(1) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 stating: \"Complainant absent. No representation for several hearings. Accused present. Petition u/s 256(1) Cr. P.C. is allowed. Complainant continuously absent from the hearing date 3.3.05. Hence, Complainant called three times. Neither the complainant nor his counsel represent before the Court till 5.30 p.m. CW1 examined. Hence Accused is acquitted u/s 256(1) of Cr.P.C.\"  An appeal was preferred thereagainst before the High Court. The same was allowed relying on or on the basis of a decision of this Court in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. Keshvanand [(1998) 1 SCC 6871998 (1) SCC 6871997 ILO SC 1230 : AIR 1998 SC 536]1998 AIR(SC) 536.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  It was submitted by Mr. Anand, appearing in person, that the complainant having remained absent for more than one year, the High Court ought not to have interfered with the discretionary jurisdiction exercised by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, particularly when he had been appearing in person and the complainant not only executed a power of attorney in favour of another, a lawyer was also appointed. Mr. Anand would submit that it was obligatory on the part of the advocate who is an agent of his client to appear on the dates of hearing, more so when an accused had been appearing in person and remained present in court for all the days of hearing.  In any event, it was urged, the High Court committed a serious error in disposing of the appeal only upon hearing a legal aid counsel and even the submissions made by him had not been noticed.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Mr. A. Regunathan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, however, submitted that in view of the fact that the matter was adjourned for examination of DWs, the learned Magistrate could not have exercised its jurisdiction under Section 256 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: We may, at the outset, notice that before passing the impugned order, the High Court did not choose to serve notice upon the appellant opining that no useful purpose would be served in keeping the appeal pending and one G. Vinodkumar was appointed as a legal aid counsel. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant is before us. Section 256 of the Code provides for disposal of a complaint in default. It entails in acquittal. But, the question which arises for consideration is as to whether the said provision could have been resorted to in the facts of the case as the witnesses on behalf of complainant have already been examined. The date was fixed for examining the defence witnesses. Appellant could have examined witnesses, if he wanted to do the same. In that case, the appearance of the complainant was not necessary. It was for her to cross-examine the witnesses examined on behalf of the defence.  The accused was entitled to file an application under Section 311 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Such an application was required to be considered and disposed of by the learned Magistrate. We have noticed hereinbefore that the complainant did not examine herself as a witness.  She was sought to be summoned again for cross-examination. The said prayer has not yet been allowed. But, that would not mean that on that ground the court would exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Section 256 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 at that stage or the defence would not examine his witnesses. Presence of the complainant or her lawyer would have been necessary, as indicated hereinbefore, only for the purpose of cross- examination of the witnesses examined on behalf of the defence. If she did not intend to do so, she would do so at her peril but it cannot be said that her presence was absolutely necessary.  Furthermore, when the prosecution has closed its case and the accused has been examined under Section 311 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the court was required to pass a judgment on merit of the matter. We are not concerned herein as to whether the constituted attorney of the complainant could represent the complainant. Similar contention of the complainant that the advocate is an agent of his client and it is his duty to appear on behalf of his client, in our opinion, is beyond the scope of this appeal.\n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n On 5th May 2009 the learned counsel appearing for the parties were put to notice that this petition will be disposed of finally at the admission stage. Accordingly, the submissions have been heard of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the learned counsel appearing for the first respondent as well as learned Public Prosecutor for the State. The petitioner was arraigned as an accused in a complaint filed by the first respondent alleging commission of offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"the said Act\"). The petitioner was taken in custody on passing the order of conviction. An appeal against the order of conviction was preferred by the petitioner.  5. On 22nd October 2008, this Court issued notice to the first respondent. This Court, by way of ad-interim relief, stayed the direction of deposit of court fees of Rs.51,800/-. This Court also stayed the direction to deposit the balance 50% of the fine amount. It must be stated here that in terms of order dated 8th October 2008, the petitioner deposited a sum of Rs. 5.00 lakhs with the Sessions Court before filing this petition and accordingly the petitioner has been enlarged on bail.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n The submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that as a condition for suspension of the substantive sentence the petitioner could not have been called upon to deposit the entire fine amount of Rs.10.00 lakhs. The submission of the counsel for the petitioner is that the Sessions Court could have imposed a condition of deposit of a reasonable amount. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the petitioner is a student and therefore it was unjust on the part of the Sessions Court to have directed the petitioner to deposit the entire fine amount of Rs.10.00 lakhs. He submitted that a sum of Rs.5.00 lakhs has already been deposited by the petitioner which is a reasonable amount. He submitted that there is no provision in the Bombay Court Fees Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Court Fees Act\") requiring an accused to pay ad-valorem court fees while preferring an appeal against the order of conviction. He submitted that the direction to pay the court fees on memorandum of appeal defeats the right of appeal of the petitioner-accused against an order of conviction.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe learned counsel appearing for the first respondent supported the impugned order directing the petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs.10.00 lakhs. He submitted that considering the findings recorded by the learned Magistrate, there was every justification for issuing such a direction.  This Court had called upon the learned Public Prosecutor Mr.Borulkar to appear in the matter as the question was regarding the liability of payment of court fees on ad-valorem basis. When a query was made to the learned Public Prosecutor as to whether there is any specific provision under the Court Fees Act under which an accused is required to pay ad-valorem court fees on the basis of fine/compensation amount while preferring an appeal against an order of conviction, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that he could not lay his hands on any such provision under the Court Fees Act.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nBy the judgement and order dated 03rd October 2008, the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, at Niphad convicted the petitioner for commission of offence under section 138 of the said Act. The petitioner was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for one month and to pay a fine of Rs.10.00 lakhs. In default of payment of fine, he was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for fifteen days. Out of the fine amount of Rs.10.00 lakhs, a sum of Rs.9.00 lakhs was ordered to be paid to the first respondent. In the appeal an application was made by the petitioner under section 389(1) of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as \"the said Code\").  An order was passed on the said application at Exhibit-4 on 8th October 2008 by the learned Ad-hoc Additional Sessions Judge, Niphad. By the said order the learned Judge stayed the execution of sentence on the petitioner depositing 50% of the fine amount immediately and the remaining amount within fifteen days. The petitioner was ordered to be enlarged on bail only on deposit of 50% of the fine amount. On 15th October 2008, on an application filed by the petitioner, the learned Additional Sessions Judge passed an order granting time to the petitioner as a last chance to deposit the court fees till 20th October 2008. The challenge in this petition under Article 227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 is to the order dated 8th October 2008 passed on application under section 389(1) of the said Code. The challenge is also to the direction issued by the Sessions Court to the petitioner to pay the court fees on the appeal.\n",
    "Case_Result": "It appears that on the appeal against the order of conviction, the petitioner was called upon to pay ad-valorem court fees on the basis of the fine amount. It appears that the petitioner was called upon to pay court fees of Rs.51,800/-. Initially the Sessions Court granted time up to 15th October 2008 to the petitioner to pay the court fees.I have carefully considered the submissions. The first question is regarding validity of the direction issued by the learned Additional Sessions Judge regarding deposit of entire fine amount of Rs.10.00 lakhs. The law on this aspect relating to appeals arising out of an order of conviction under section 138 of the said Act has been laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Dilip S. Dahanukar Vs. Kotak Mahindra Company Limited and another ([2007]6-SCC-521)In the present case, out of the fine amount of Rs.10.00 lakhs, a sum of Rs.5.00 lakhs has already been deposited by the petitioner. In the application made by the petitioner before the Sessions Court under section 389(1) to the said Code, it was set out that the petitioner was a student taking education in college and his examination was to commence on 17th October 2008. It must be noted here that the order of conviction was passed by the learned Magistrate on 3rd October 2008. However, the learned Magistrate while exercising the power under sub section 3 of section 389 of the said Code granted bail to the petitioner subject to deposit of 50% of the amount. It is stated that as the petitioner could not pay the said amount, he was taken into custody. Considering these aspects, the direction issued by the learned Additional Sessions Judge to deposit entire fine amount of Rs. 10.00 lakhs was unjust and improper. The substantive sentence of imprisonment was of one month. The sentence in default of payment of fine was of fifteen days. Therefore, after admitting the appeal against conviction, a direction issued imposing a condition of deposit of Rs.10.00 lakhs virtually amounted to denial of right of appeal to the petitioner. As stated earlier, the petitioner has already deposited a sum of Rs.5.00 lakhs which can be certainly said to be a reasonable amount in terms of the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Dilip S. Dahanukar (supra).Against an order of conviction for the offence punishable under section 138 of the said Act, an appeal is maintainable before a Sessions Court in view of sub section 3 of section 374 of the said Code.It will be necessary to refer to the relevant provisions of the Court Fees Act which deal with the appeals. Perhaps the only section of the Court Fees Act which deals with the appeals is section 7. On plain reading of section 7 the same is applicable where the challenge is to an order relating to compensation under any Act for the time being in force for the acquisition of land for public purpose. Sub section 2 of section 7 applies to an appeal preferred against an award of a Claims Tribunal under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Section 7 has no application to an appeal preferred against an order of conviction.t will be necessary to refer to the first and second schedules of the Court Fees Act. Article-1 of Schedule-I deals with memorandum of an appeal which is not otherwise provided for in the Court Fees Act which is presented to any civil or revenue Court. Therefore, Article-1 will not apply to the appeals under the said Code. Article-3 of Schedule-I deals with an appeal against an order passed under the Arbitration Act, 1940. Article-4 of Schedule-I deals with a memorandum of appeal which is capable of treated as a suit to set aside a decree or order having a force of decreeArticles-5 and 6 of Schedule-I deal with memorandum of appeals filed to set aside alienation or for possession. Article-7 of Schedule-I also deals with an appeal.None of the other articles of Schedule-I deal with an appeal against an order of conviction. A perusal of Schedule-II of the Court Fees Act shows that none of the articles therein apply to an appeal under section 374 of the said Code. It will be necessary to refer to Article-18 of Schedule-I which is incorporated by Maharashtra Act No.17 of 2008. Article-18 applies to a complaint or charge of an offence under section 138 of the said Act. It provides that the court fees of Rs.200/- is payable on such a complaint or charge when the amount of cheque does not exceed Rs.10,000/-. It provides that when the amount of cheque exceeds Rs.10,000/-, the court fees payable on the complaint will be Rs.200/- for every Rs.10,000/- or part thereof subject to maximum of Rs. 1.50 lakhs. If the Legislature intended that the court fees shall be payable on memorandum of appeal for challenging an order of conviction passed for the offence under section 138 of the said Act, the Legislature would have certainly amended the provisions of the Court Fees Act when amendment was carried out by incorporating Article-18 of Schedule-I by Maharashtra Act No.17 of 2008.15. It will be necessary to refer to section 43 of the Court Fees Act. Sub section 1 provides for grant of refund of court fees in any suit or an appeal or cross objection. Sub section 2 of section 43 of the Court Fees Act was amended by the same Maharashtra Act No.17 of 2008 providing for refund of court fees paid on the complaint under section 138 of the said Act. As a result of the said amendment, the State Government is entitled to pass an order providing for repayment of court fees paid on a complaint under section 138 of the said Act. It is pertinent to note that if the Legislature intended to provide that an ad-valorem court fees are payable on compensation amount or fine amount in an appeal against the order of conviction for the offence under section 138 of the said Act, the Legislature would have amended sub section 1 and sub section 2 of section 43 providing for refund of the court fees on memorandum of such an appeal. However, that has not been done.In paragraph 55 the Apex Court has held thus:- Petition partly allowed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 634ea1df0eb98db8410fb25f\n**Facts**: The petitioner who has been convicted by the learned Courts below for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 has filed the instant revision petition. he complainant/respondent had filed complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, (for short 'the Act'), on the grounds that the petitioner/accused had issued cheque No. RTQ 034402, dated 31.12.1999, amounting to Rs.53,200/- discharge of his liability. The cheque was dishonoured by the bank with the remarks \"insufficient funds\". The respondent thereafter issued legal notice on 5.1.2000 to the petitioner/accused calling upon him to make the payment within 15 days from the receipt of the notice. The legal notice was duly received by the petitioner but he did not make any payment.  The petitioner/accused was summoned and thereafter notice of accusation was put to him to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The complainant/respondent was directed to produce his evidence. In order to prove his case, the complainant examined four witnesses in all and closed his evidence. After completion of evidence, entire incriminating circumstances and evidence were put to the petitioner. The petitioner/accused in his defence examined three witnesses and closed his evidence.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The learned trial Court after evaluating the evidence and hearing the parties, convicted and sentenced the accused/petitioner to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months and imposed a fine of Rs.30,000/- out of which Rs.20,000/- was directed to be paid to the complainant/respondent as compensation and in default of payment of fine, the accused was directed to further undergo simple imprisonment of two months. The petitioner filed the appeal before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, however, the same were dismissed vide judgment dated 24.04.2009, constraining the petitioner to file the instant revision petition.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: It is vehemently argued by Shri G.D. Verma, Sr. Advocate, duly assisted by Shri B.C. Verma, Advocate that the findings recorded by the learned Courts below are perverse as respondent case does not fall under any of the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act and at best would amount to a civil dispute. 31. Learned counsel for the petitioner/accused would thereafter argue that complaint was bad for no-joinder of necessary party inasmuch as Smt. Prabhi Devi and Parkash Chand, who were specifically named in the agreement have not been arrayed as party and would place strong reliance upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court Jitendra Vora v. Bhavana Y. Shah and another, (2015) 16 SCC 744 2015 ILO SC 642.\n**Argument by Respondent**: On the other hand, Shri N.S. Chandel, Advocate, would support the findings rendered by the learned Courts below that the petitioner/accused had issued the cheques which are negotiable instruments and once the same was dishonoured, the petitioner was liable to be prosecuted and punished as per the provisions of the Act.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have carefully and meticulously gone through the records of the case. 7. Before proceeding to embark upon the relative merits of the case, it would be necessary to note the scope and power of this Court while dealing with such type of criminal revision petitions.  Section 138 of the Act was incorporated with a specific object of enacting a special provision to impose a strict liability so far as the negotiable instruments are concerned. . The purpose of attaching criminal liability to the offence under Section 138 of the Act, which is more in the nature of a civil dispute is only to ensure the credibility of cheques as Negotiable Instruments.  Reverting to the case in hand, it is rightly observed by the learned Courts below that there was no dispute regarding issuance of cheque by the petitioner/accused. It was dishonoured on account of \"insufficient funds\" and legal notice was served upon the petitioner/accused. Therefore, the only question left for consideration whether the cheque was issued for towards discharge of debt or other liability as envisaged under Section 138 of the Act. As observed earlier, the specific case of the petitioner/accused is that no case whatsoever is made out for commission of the offence under the Act and at best it is a case of Civil dispute and in support of his contention, the learned counsel for the petitioner/accused has placed reliance upon the following judgments:- I have gone though the aforesaid judgment and find that the facts therein were that a complaint was filed against the proprietor of first firm and her Power of Attorney (wife and husband, respectively), when the said Power of Attorney had drawn cheques on first firm's account, when liability in discharge of which the dishonoured cheques had been issued was of second firm. The second firm which owed the liability was not impleaded nor even its proprietor was impleaded in that capacity. It was also found therein that the first firm had never taken on the liability of the second firm and thus the complaint was held to be not maintainable for mis-joinder of parties. However, this is not the fact situation obtaining in the instant case, therefore, the aforesaid judgment is not at all applicable to the facts of the present case.  At this stage, it would be necessary to reiterate that the learned Courts below have concurrently come to the findings that the petitioner had purchased land from the complainant being power of attorney of the owner of the land, however, he happened to have occupied more land than purchased by him and when this fact was detected, the parties entered into a compromise which was reduced in writing vide Ex. CW2/X dated 4.7.1999, wherein it was agreed that the petitioner/accused would make payment of the land un-authorisedly occupied by him. As per the compromise, the petitioner had issued a cheque bearing No. RTQ 034402, dated 31.12.1999 Ex.CW1/A of Rs.53,200/-, which was presented for payment to the bank concerned however the same was returned through memo Ext. CW1/B dated 4.1.2000 with endorsement \"insufficient funds\". Thereafter respondent issued notice under Section 138 of the Act but despite notice respondent did not pay the amount within the statutory period.  In support of the complaint, respondent had examined PW1 G.P. Pandey, Manager, Punjab National Bank, Solan, who stated that the cheque was dishonoured due to 'insufficient funds'. Similarly PW2 Tara Chand, the Cashier from State Bank of Patiala, Chambaghat exhibited the certificate Ex.CW2/A regarding the account of complainant to show that two cheques had been deposited in the account of the respondent/complainant, extract of account Ext.PW2/A. He further deposed that cheque had been returned to the bank by the Punjab National Bank through memo Ex.CW1/B as there was 'insufficient funds' in the account. PW3 Atma Ram has proved the agreement dated 4.7.1999 Ex.CW2/X wherein the petitioner had agreed to pay Rs.98,000/- to the complainant/respondent regarding which cheques worth Rs.53,200/- and Rs.44,800/-, respectively were issued in his presence and in the presence of one Haminder Thakur to the respondent. Notably he is one of the signatory to the agreement.  In rebuttal petitioner/accused examined DW1 Om Parkash Panwar from Punjab National Bank who have produced the record of cheque return register is Ex.CW1/C and stated that the in cheque return memo Ex. CW1/B, it was maintained that cheque was issued from the different account. While being cross- examined by the complainant, this witness categorically stated that on the day of presentation of cheque, the petitioner was having Rs.1309/- in his account and thus was having 'insufficient funds'.  DW2 Dalip Thakur, who was known to the parties has stated that he had got the matter compromised between the respondent and the petitioner and at that time DW3 Anil Gupta, Parkash Chand, Haminder and A.S. Minhas were also present when compromise Ex.CW2/X was written. He further stated that the petitioner had issued post dated cheques in favour of the respondent, but subsequently he was told that land regarding which payment was to be made was already in the name of Parkash Chand, therefore, he had got the payment stopped. In cross-examination, he stated that he was told by the accused that at the time of encashment of cheque worth Rs.53,200/- there was insufficient funds. He stated that he had written the compromise Ex.CW2/X.  He also admitted that it was agreed that 38 sq. metres of land of Parkash Chand and 32 sq. metres land of Prabhi Devi was encroached by the petitioner regarding which the petitioner had issued post dated cheques in favour of the respondent and witnesses had signed the compromise. DW3 Anil Gupta, who was present at the time of compromise Ex.CW2/X stated that petitioner has constructed his house and regarding the excess land he had issued post dated cheques in favour of the respondent, but subsequently he was told by the petitioner that the respondent could not execute the Registry, therefore, he got the payment stopped. In his cross- examination, this witness stated that he was working as Senior Manager in the bank and even DW2 Dalip Thakur was working in the same bank.  He admitted that the compromise was admitted by both the parties and thereafter was signed by the parties as well the witnesses and it was in lieu thereof the cheques had been issued. He further stated that there were about 5-7 persons present at the time when the compromise was written which was written with the intention that there may not be future dispute between the parties. . Thus, from the aforesaid narration, it stands established that there was no dispute with regard to the compromise Ex.CW2/X or the issuance of the post dated cheques in favour of the respondent. These facts not only proved by the respondent and his witnesses but even admitted by the witnesses examined by the petitioner. It is further proved on record that petitioner did not have sufficient funds in his account as it stands duly proved that petitioner had only Rs. 1309/- in his account. Petitioner had though tried to prove that he himself ordered \"stop payment\" because the land was already in the name of the Parkash Chand but the record clearly belies the version put-forth as it is a case where the cheque has not been dishonoured on account of 'stop payment' but on account of 'insufficient funds'. Further story put up by the petitioner through DW3 Anil Gupta that respondent was not in a position to execute the sale deed and therefore he got the payment stopped is also not borne out or rather is contrary to the record and again deserves to be rejected for the aforesaid reasons.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The appeal should be **ALLOWED**. \n\nWhile the lower court correctly cited the relevant sections of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act in its judgment, it erred in not considering the provisions of the Bombay Court Fees Act, 1959. Under the said Act, an accused is not required to pay ad-valorem court fees while preferring an appeal against the order of conviction. The direction to pay court fees on the memorandum of appeal defeats the right of appeal of the petitioner-accused against an order of conviction. \n\nThe lower court should have imposed a condition of deposit of a reasonable amount instead of the entire fine amount. The petitioner, a student, being unable to pay such a large sum, indicates that the court's decision is unjust. The petitioner has already deposited Rs. 5.00 lakhs, which is a reasonable amount.\n\nTherefore, the appeal is allowed, and the direction to deposit the entire fine amount of Rs. 10.00 lakhs is set aside. The petitioner is directed to deposit a reasonable amount, as decided by the court, within four weeks from the date of this order."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nn this petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 and under Section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, \"the Code\"), the petitioner has prayed that First Information Report bearing Crime No.M/01/06 dated 8/2/2006 registered at P.S. Daman (for short, \"the said complaint\") be quashed and set aside. He has also prayed for certain consequential reliefs.  Since the petitioner is seeking quashing of the said complaint, it is necessary to examine its contents. Gist of the said complaint is as follows: a) The 4th Respondent in the petition is the complainant and is the power of attorney holder of M/s. Century Pulp & Paper Division of M/s. Century Textile & Industries Limited (for convenience, \"the complainant company\"). M/s. Shiv Ganga Paper Converters Private Limited is the 1st accused in the complaint (for short, \"the accused company\"). It is a private limited company, having its industrial units at Daman, Kota (Rajasthan) and Rudrapur (Uttaranchal). The 1st accused manufactures note books and, hence, requires paper. The petitioner is the 2nd accused. He is the director of the accused company. The 3rd accused - Arun Kejariwal, the 4th accused - Smt. Usha Kejariwal and the 5th accused - Nikhil Kejariwal are the directors of the accused company. They are related to each other. The 6th Accused - B.K. Mehta and the 7th accused - Vinod Tiwari are the managers of both the units of the 1st accused at Daman. M/s. Narsingh Das & Co. is the authorised dealer of the complainant company. b) The complainant company entered into an agreement with the accused company to sell to the latter 4000 M.T. of paper over a contractual period beginning from 1/4/2005 and ending on 31/3/2006. As per the agreement, payments were to be made within 30 days of the goods being dispatched, in default of which interest was to be charged. c) Initially, the accused company was regular in payments. In the first week of January, 2006, instead of depositing three cheques in the Corporation Bank, the accused company deposited only one cheque and other two cheques were deposited later. The balance amount of Rs.1,73,73,212/-was outstanding from the accused company till 22/12/2005 which the accused company ought to have paid before 22/1/2006. As the accused company was not making the payment, the complainant company approached the accused company on 28/1/2006. The petitioner gave an excuse that there were disputes between the directors and he was not able to make any payment.  After long pursuation, the 3rd accused i.e. Arun Kejariwal promised to make part payment. He handed over two cheques of Rs.10 lakhs one dated 31/1/2006 and another dated 2/2/2006 and authorization for return of 100 M.T. paper of the value of Rs.35 lakhs. He asked the complainant company to approach the 4th respondent for the outstanding amount. There was express promise to make payment of the dues in the first week of February, 2006. When the complainant approached the 2nd accused, he promised to make the payment in kind by returning 250 M.T. paper from Daman and 100 M.T. paper from Rudrapur (Uttaranchal). On 3/2/2006, he authorised the complainant and M/s. Narsingh Das & Co. to receive the said paper. The value of 350 M.T. paper was about Rs.1,15,00,000/-. d) On 6/2/2006, the complainant went to Daman to receive 250 M.T. of paper from the units of Bhimpore, Nani Daman. The complainant learnt that there are number of creditors of the accused to whom the accused had not made payment.  The complainant contacted the 6th accused, that is, B.K. Mishra, General Manager of the accused company for delivery of paper. However, he refused to give delivery by saying that he will not accept the order of the 2nd accused. When the 2nd accused was contacted on phone, he replied that he had never consented for delivery of paper. e) The complainant learnt that the accused who are from one family and who claim to be directors of the accused company had diverted all their funds in benami transactions since last few months. They had purchased properties in the name of their relatives at Faridabad - Gurgaon Road and formed another company by name M/s. Aastha Agriculture Private Limited in Gauhati (Assam). The 5th accused had wound up all his Daman units and shifted to Kota with his family. f) Though there was no business and the accused had not paid money to the suppliers, the accused purchased large quantity of paper. They made the complainant believe that they had purchased crores of rupees worth paper. Just to avoid payment and to make a show that they had honest intentions, the accused gave authorization dated 3/2/2006 to receive 250 M.T. paper which was not honoured by them. They diverted their funds and formed another company All the accused are thus party to a criminal conspiracy. They have committed offence under Section 420 read with Section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short, \"the IPC\").  The said complaint was registered under Section 420 read with Section 120-B of the IPC at P.S. Daman against the petitioner and five other accused.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nWe have heard Mr. Pradhan, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner. He submitted that a purely civil dispute has been given the colour of a criminal offence. He submitted that this is a dispute about goods sold and delivered and payments allegedly not received for the same. Criminal law could not have been set into motion on these facts. Mr. Pradhan submitted that, after filing of the said complaint, on 20/6/2006, the complainant-company has filed a suit in the Delhi High Court, which is pending adjudication. . Learned counsel then urged that, in fact, the complainant-company and the accused had settled the dispute. He drew our attention to the annexures to the petition. He pointed out that on 8/5/2006, a pursis came to be filed in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Daman, which stated that the accused had accepted the liability and consented to give delivery of 227 M.T. of paper and, in the circumstances, the complainant-company consented that \"the prosecution may be disposed of, even though the civil liability is not affected\".  Learned counsel pointed out that this pursis is signed by the advocate for the accused and advocate for the complainant-company. It is also signed by Mr. Pradeep Gupta for M/s. Narsingh Dass & Co., who is the authorized dealer of the complainant-company. The pursis is also signed by the 3rd accused. On the same day, affidavit came to be filed by the 3rd accused, inter alia, stating that 227 M.T. of paper is to be delivered to the complainant-company and, he had decided to honour the challan issued by the petitioner. Mr. Pradhan drew our attention to order dated 8/5/2006 passed by I/C. Chief Judicial Magistrate, Daman, in which he has observed that all the parties to the pursis have admitted the contents and they have also agreed to the compromise agreement.  Learned Magistrate has further recorded that all the applications are disposed of in terms of pursis (Ex-18). Pursis (Ex-18) is signed by the advocate for the complainant-company and the 3rd accused. Learned counsel submitted that in view of the settlement, this court should quash the complaint as its continuance will be a futile exercise. Learned counsel submitted that in any case, the petitioner had resigned from the directorship of the accused-company on 30/12/2005. He drew our attention to an order passed by the Company Law Board, New Delhi, (for short, \"the CLB\"), dated 16/1/2009. He submitted that the CLB has accepted that the petitioner has resigned from the directorship of the accused-company. The CLB has observed that he shall continue to be on the Board of the accused-company till the accounts are settled. It is observed that the petitioner was able to make out its case of oppression and mismanagement resulting in gross-misappropriation of funds and stocks despite the CLB's orders and, therefore, he shall not be liable for any default subsequent to the date of intimation of disassociation with the affairs of the accused-company. Learned counsel submitted that, therefore, in any event, from the date of the petitioner's resignation i.e. 30/12/2005, the petitioner cannot be held responsible for any mismanagement or offence committed by the accused-company. Mr. Pradhan submitted that this is therefore a fit case where this court should in exercise of its power under Article 227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950 and Section 482 of the Code quash the said complaint.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nWe have also heard Mr. Nalawade, learned counsel appearing for the 1st respondent i.e. Union Territory of Daman and Diu. Mr. Nalawade submitted that it is well settled that a complaint can be quashed only if on the face of it, it does not disclose any offence. Learned counsel submitted that in this case, the said complaint clearly discloses the offence of cheating and, therefore, it cannot be quashed. Mr. Nalawade submitted that on the said complaint, learned Magistrate has passed an order under Section 156(3) of the Code for inquiry and investigation. Relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in T. Vengama Naidu v. T. Dora Swamy Naidu & Ors., (2007) 12 SCC 93, learned counsel submitted that the FIR is to be taken at its face value for adjudging the same.  Where investigation is in progress and the police has not submitted a report to the Magistrate, the FIR can be quashed only if there appears to be no offence spelt out in the complaint. At the stage of investigation, the High Court cannot examine the nature of transaction or whether any offence was actually committed by the accused or not. The High Court cannot quash the FIR, at this stage, by examining the nature of the transaction. Learned counsel drew our attention to the affidavit in reply filed by Mr. D.M. Jadav, HCB, attached to the Daman Police Station wherein it is stated that there are number of cases relating to bouncing of cheques registered against the accused. It is also stated that two similar cases have been filed in Surat and Ahmedabad, and one by Tamil Nadu Print Paper Mills in Chennai Court against the accused-company. He submitted that in the circumstances no case is made out for quashing the said complaint. We have also heard Mr. Malik, learned counsel appearing for the 4th respondent. He submitted that this is not a case where the complaint does not make out any offence at all. He submitted that an offence under Section 420 of the IPC is clearly made out. Learned counsel submitted that the contention that the dispute is of civil nature is totally misconceived. He submitted that no settlement was ever arrived at between the accused-company and the complainant-company and Narsingh Dass had no authority to settle the dispute. \nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe civil suit must, therefore, be allowed to be prosecuted and the criminal complaint ought to be quashed. In support of his submissions, learned counsel relied on the judgments of the Supreme Court in Alpic Finance Ltd. v. P. Sadasivan & Anr., (2001) 3 SCC 513, Hridaya Ranjan Prasad Verma & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Anr., (2000) 4 SCC 168, Vir Prakash Sharma v. Anil Kumar Agarwal & Anr., (2007) 7 SCC 373, Ajay Mitra v. State of M.P. & Ors., (2003) 3 SCC 11, G. Sagar Suri & Anr. v. State of U.P., (2000) 2 SCC 636 and Indian Oil Corpn. v. NEPC India Ltd. & Ors., (2006) 6 SCC 736.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Before we go to the cases cited by Mr. Pradhan, it is necessary to refer to the petitioner's case that he had resigned from the accused company. Mr. Jadhav, the investigating officer has stated in his affidavit that the petitioner has written a letter on 3/2/2006 in his capacity as the director of the accused company. He has signed the said letter as a director. The complainant has in his affidavit also stated so. Prima facie, this conduct of the petitioner militates against his case that he had resigned from the accused company. His case of resignation, therefore, cannot be accepted at this stage. It requires to be investigated. Reliance placed by Mr. Pradhan on the CLB's order dated 13/3/2009 is also misplaced. It is pertinent to note that before the CLB, the petitioner who is the 2nd accused had alleged mismanagement of the accused company by accused 3 to 5. It is an internal matter between the directors. Obviously, the complainant company could never have participated in the proceedings before the CLB. The order shows that accused 3 to 5 admitted that the petitioner was not involved in the affairs of the company since November, 2005. It is in these circumstances inter alia on the concession made by accused 3 to 5 that the CLB observed that the petitioner shall not be liable for any defaults subsequent to the date of intimation of disassociation with the affairs of the accused company. At this stage, the petitioner cannot be absolved of the allegations made against him on the basis of this order.21. In our opinion the above judgments make it clear that whether a complaint discloses a criminal offence or it involves only a civil dispute depends on facts and circumstances of each case. A complaint may have civil profile but it may also have overwhelming criminal overtones. In such case, a criminal court cannot shut its doors to it. Because a complaint involves a commercial transaction, it cannot be inferred that it contains a civil dispute if ingredients of a criminal offence are present. It is trite that in several commercial transactions, criminal offences are committed. A case involving a simplicitor dispute about quality and quantity of the goods received and the amount of price to be paid could well be described as a civil dispute in a given set of circumstances. But where ingredients of cheating or some such offence are evident from a bare reading of the complaint, its criminal nature must be acknowledged. Dishonest intention is a hallmark of a criminal complaint. Dishonest intention must be present at the inception of the offence. It must be expressly stated or indirectly suggested in the complaint. It is possible that in a given case, the complainant may later on realize that the intention of the accused was not honest at the inception. It may become evident on account of the subsequent conduct of the accused. In such cases, investigation is necessary. But subsequent conduct is not the sole test to determine whether a complaint has civil or criminal profile. It can support the case of the complainant that the accused had dishonest intention at the inception of the offence. Where there is an attempt to use a criminal complaint to harass or terrorize a party with a view to forcing it to settle a purely civil dispute such complaint should not be allowed to be prosecuted. That would amount to abuse of the process of the court. Criminal complaint which is bereft of ingredient of an offence cannot be allowed to be used as a tool to cut short time consuming civil procedure. At the same time, it must be remembered that the complainant does not have to state verbatim the ingredients of the offence alleged.Basic facts which disclose offence need to be stated. Presence of an alternative remedy is not a good enough reason for throwing the complaint overboard if it discloses criminal offence, because the alternative forum may not be able to conduct a trial and convict the accused of the offence. The power to quash the complaint should not be used to stifle a legitimate prosecution. This power should be used sparingly and with abundant caution.We shall now proceed to examine the said complaint in the light of the above principles. We, however, make it clear that we have not examined the merits of the allegations and all observations made by us are prima facie observations made while deciding whether if allegations made in the complaint are taken at their face value, they prima facie constitute any offence or not.The facts disclose that there was an agreement to supply paper between the complainant company and the accused company and initially the accused company was making regular payments. This agreement is dated 2/4/2005. The balance amount of Rs.1,73,73,212/- was outstanding from the accused till 22/12/2005 which ought to have been paid before 22/1/2006. The accused avoided to make the payment. These facts by themselves may create an impression that this is a civil dispute. But read in the context of other facts they prima facie disclose a criminal offence. Accused 3 to 5 are closely related. It is clearly stated in the complaint that though there was no business and the accused had not paid money to the suppliers, the accused purchased large quantity of paper. They made the complainant believe that they had purchased crores of rupees worth paper and to avoid payment and to make a show of their so-called honest intention the petitioner issued an authorization dated 3/2/2006 on the basis of which the complainant was to receive the paper back. The authorization was not honoured. The averment that the accused purchased the paper though they had no business and had not paid their suppliers; that they made the complainant believe that they had purchased paper worth crores of rupees prima facie make out a case of dishonest intention at the inception of the offence. In our opinion, averments made in the complaint expressly state that the accused had mala fide intention at the inception of the offence and at any rate they indirectly suggest so.The averment pertaining to the authorization issued by the petitioner which was not honoured is equally important. It is stated in the complaint that when the complainant went to Daman and met the 6th accused - the Manager of the accused company for delivery of paper, he refused to abide by the authorization. When he contacted the petitioner on phone, the petitioner stated that he had never consented for return of papers. The subsequent conduct of the accused in issuing authorization which was not honoured, of not paying the suppliers; of diverting their funds in benami transactions, etc. fortify the complainant's case that the accused had dishonest intention at the inception of the offence. Though subsequent conduct is not the sole test to determine whether there is dishonest intention, it is not irrelevant (Hridaya Ranjan's case). 25. It is also stated in the said complaint that the accused who come from one family have diverted their funds in Benami transactions. They have purchased properties in the names of their relatives in Faridabad-Gurgaon Road and formed another company by name M/s. Aastha Agricultural Private Limited in Gauhati.The 5th accused has shifted to Kota with his family after winding up the units in Daman. All these facts stated in the said complaint will have to be read together. The said complaint has to be read as a whole (Indian Oil Corporation's case). Case of intention to cheat is prima facie supported by these facts averred in the said complaint. Assuming that the facts stated in the said complaint would as well reveal a commercial or money transaction, that is hardly a reason for holding that the offence of cheating would elude from it when ingredients of offence are so clearly stated in the said complaint (Rajesh Bajaj's case).We are informed that a civil suit is filed by the complainant in the Delhi High Court. It is argued that the said complaint must be quashed on this ground.  This submission is, therefore, rejected. In Ajay Mitra's case, the Supreme Court noticed that the appellants/accused were not in the picture when the offence was committed and therefore the essential ingredient of guilty intention was lacking. In this case, prima facie, the accused were on the scene right from the beginning. Hence, reliance placed on this judgment is misplaced. Similarly, in Vir Prakash's case, the Supreme Court was of the view that the allegations in the complaint did not disclose the ingredients of criminal breach of trust. There were vague allegations of subsequent conduct. In this case, as already stated by us the said complaint sets out all the particulars with sufficient clarity. It is, therefore, not possible for us to apply the ratio of this judgment to the present case. This takes us to the case of the petitioner that the said complaint deserves to be quashed in view of the settlement between the parties. It is not possible for us to accept the case of settlement because the complainant is seriously disputing the alleged settlement. It is stated in the petition that on 8/5/2006, since the dispute was settled the 3rd accused filed an affidavit before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Daman, stating that he was aware about his liability as per the agreement and he will respect it. It is further stated that on 8/5/2006, the representative of the complainant-companyMr. Pradeep Gupta executed a pursis in the court saying that since the accused had accepted the liability \"the prosecution may be disposed, even though civil liability is not affected\". Copy of the affidavit and pursis are annexed to the petition. Prima facie, it is difficult to accept this story. The complainant has filed affidavit denying this story. As stated by him, the pursis is not signed by the petitioner. It is stated to be signed by the 3rd accused. According to the complainant, he had not given authority to Mr. Pradeep Gupta to file a pursis on behalf of the complainant company. In such circumstances, the compromise theory cannot be accepted.32. In Nikhil Merchant's case, the Supreme Court observed that in case of a dispute which has overtones of a civil dispute with certain criminal facets, if there is compromise between the parties, the FIR can be quashed because the continuance of the same would be a futile exercise. There can be no dispute about this proposition and if the parties had, in fact, settled their disputes, we would have considered the prayer for quashing the said complaint. But, since there is a serious dispute about the petitioner's contention that there was any compromise, and it is alleged that the person who allegedly signed the pursis had no authority to do so, in our writ jurisdiction, we are unable to decide whether there was compromise or not. Consequently, prayer for quashing cannot be entertained. Nikhil Merchant's case does not help the petitioner.This is not a case where if the allegations made in the said complaint are taken at their face value, they do not prima facie disclose any offence. Ingredients of cheating are very much present. It is not possible to hold, at this stage, that the said complaint is filed with mala fide intention to wreak vengeance. Petition dismissed",

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue of the case is whether the lower court correctly ruled to allow the civil suit and quash the criminal complaint filed by the complainant-company against the petitioner, who is the director of the accused company, for an alleged offence under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The lower court allowed the civil suit and quashed the criminal complaint based on the argument that a purely civil dispute has been given the colour of a criminal offence, and the complaint does not make out any offence at all. The lower court also considered the settlement between the accused and complainant-company and the petitioner's resignation from the directorship of the accused company.\n\nAssessing the lower court's judgment critically, it appears that the court applied the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act in an appropriate manner. The key arguments presented by the petitioner, such as the dispute being of a civil nature and the criminal law not having been set into motion on the facts, are valid points. The evidence presented, including the settlement between the parties and the petitioner's resignation, also supports the initial ruling.\n\nHowever, the core legal question is whether the lower court correctly interpreted the evidence and applied the law. In this case, the settlement between the parties and the petitioner's resignation from the directorship of the accused company could potentially affect the criminal liability of the petitioner. While the lower court considered these points, the legal standing of these factors in relation to the criminal complaint under Section 420 of the IPC requires further analysis.\n\nBased on the analysis, the appeal should be dismissed, as there is insufficient evidence to support the claim that the complaint does not make out any offence at all. The lower court's decision to allow the civil suit and quash the criminal complaint should be reconsidered, taking into account the potential impact of the settlement and the petitioner's resignation on the criminal liability of the petitioner.\n\nSummary: DISMISSED"

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe petitioner and the respondent are both limited companies incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956. The authorised share capital of the petitioner-company is Rs. 12,50,00,000 divided into 1,25,00,000 shares of Rs. 10 each, as per the balance-sheet of the petitioner-company up to the date of filing of this petition. Similarly, the respondent-company has paid-up capital of Rs. 3,75,65,640 divided into 37,56,564 shares of Rs. 10 each.  The present petition has been instituted by the petitioner-company seeking winding up of the respondent-company on its failure to pay debts.  The factual background leading to the filing of the present petition is as under : As per the averments made in the petition, the respondent-company is engaged in the business of manufacturing industrial control equipments. On the request of the respondent-company, the petitioner advanced short-term loans to the respondent-company for funding its capital requirement for the purpose of development of a chip called VCU (Versatile Component Unit). The total loan advanced by the petitioner-company from time to time is said to be Rs. 5,40,893,273. It is alleged that these short-term loans were repayable after one year or at least with the close of the financial year.  The respondent-company issued various post dated cheques for the re-payment of the loan and also issued receipts acknowledging the advancement of the loan from time to time. The loan was repayable with interest. The respondent-company paid interest through cheques after deduction of TDS. It is stated that the balance confirmation of the loan is acknowledged by the respondent vide certificate for the year 2005-06, copies whereof have been placed on record as annexure P3. The parties also entered into a loan agreement dated April 15, 2005 (annexure P4). Clause (b) of the aforesaid agreement, inter alia, refers to earlier loans and also additional loan as detailed in annexure A to the agreement and also the additional loan of Rs. 2 crores. The copy of TDS certificate dated June 30, 2004, in Form No. 16A regarding payment of the interest has also been placed on record at page 98 of the petition. Between the time of passing of the order by the High Court of Delhi and the matter being taken up by the hon'ble Supreme Court, the petitioner-company presented the cheques and thus, the SLP was finally dismissed. In the meanwhile, the suit filed by the respondent was withdrawn.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n It is further alleged that simultaneously with the execution of the loan agreement and another share pledge agreement dated April 15, 2005, was also executed by M/s. R. L. Verma and Sons (HUF), as pledgers, in favour of the petitioner-company, as pledgee duly confirmed by the respondent-company. It was duly acknowledged in the deed of pledge that the petitioner-company had already advanced a sum of Rs. 19.20 crores to the respondent-company and it further agreed to advance an amount of Rs. 2 crores.  t is also the case of the petitioner that even after the execution of the loan agreement, the petitioner-company paid an additional loan at the request of the respondent-company and the total amount at the time of filing of the petition was more than Rs. 54 crores as noticed hereinabove which is duly reflected in the books of account maintained by the petitioner-company. The amount is repayable with interest at the rate of 12 per cent. per annum. It is alleged that the respondent-company committed various defaults and breaches of understanding between the parties, including the terms of the loan agreement and has failed to pay the loan amount with interest as per the stipulations contained therein.  Reference is made to various clauses of the agreement in paragraph 14 of the petition. It is not necessary to deal with every kind of alleged breach. On failure of the respondent to pay the loan, the petitioner served a legal notice dated January 5, 2007 (annexure P7) under sections 433 and 434 of the Companies Act, 1956, through its advocate Mr. Sudhir K. Makkar demanding the entire outstanding loan amount of Rs. 54,08,93,273 and interest through registered post. The said notice was received by the respondent who also sent a reply dated January 27, 2007 (annexure P8) through its advocate Shri P. A. S. Rao. It is alleged that the respondent illegally refuted its liability for payment of the loan on the false plea that there was some understanding between the parties where-under the loan amount was to be converted as share money for allotment of equity shares of another company, namely, Vasucorp Inc. USA.  It is also the stand of the petitioner that the issuance of share capital in the Vasucorp Inc. USA was independent of the loan transaction and was not in lieu of the loan amount advanced by the petitioner. It is also stated that Mr. Pradip Burman, managing director of the petitioner-company separately paid the share money for purchase of the share in Vasucorp Inc. USA and it has nothing to do with the loan transaction. It is further case of the petitioner that the respondent issued various post dated cheques for payment of outstanding loan amount and some cheques were replaced by some fresh cheques at the request of the respondent as on the dates the said cheques matured, the respondent did not have adequate funds and requested the petitioner to accept fresh cheque in lieu of the outstanding amounts. A list of such cheques allegedly issued by the respondent is placed on record as annexure P10. It is also the case of the petitioner that some of the cheques were presented for clearance and two such cheques were returned dishonoured for insufficiency of funds in the account and after issuing statutory notice under section 138 read with section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, proceedings under section 138 read with section 142 of the aforesaid Act were also instituted before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi It is also stated that the respondent made payment against three dishonoured cheques by making payment through pay order under the cover of its letter dated January 23, 2007. In the said letter the respondent informed the petitioner that it shall be sending demand drafts against the remaining two cheques, which have not been received. It is finally stated that the respondent is indebted to the petitioner and has become commercially insolvent company unable to discharge its lawful liability. Thus, the respondent-company is liable to be wound up.  In the rejoinder filed by the petitioner, it has also been admitted that two suits for recovery under Order XXXIIV, rule 1 of the Code Of Civil Procedure, 1908 have been filed by the petitioner in Delhi High Court, one for recovery of Rs. 20 crores and the other for recovery of Rs. 40 crores and the applications for leave to defend are pending.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe respondent-company filed its detailed written statement opposing the petition for winding up. Rejoinder thereto has also been filed. It is necessary to briefly notice the stand of the respondent-company. It is alleged that there are serious disputes and differences between the parties arising after December 11, 2006. The petitioner attempted to oust the respondent and the promoter group from the ownership, management and control of Vasucorp Inc. USA. The stand of the respondent is that it invented a novel idea of Versatile System On Chip (VSOC), a new technology and the said invented technology will challenge the micro controller architecture of global corporate giants such as Hitachi, Mitsubishi, NEC, Philips, Infineon (Siemens), Texas Instruments, Samsung, etc. The said invention was at a conceptual stage in 1999. ICICI Venture Funds Management Co. Ltd., also became interested in the new venture and also took equity stake in the respondent-company and also agreed for funding the development of new technology. It is also stated that in the year 2001, there was change in the management of the ICICI and the new management cut the financial support due to change in their funding strategy and thus, the respondent-company was faced with the financial crunch. It was interested in financial support for which market borrowing was resorted to. Mr. Pradip Burman, one of the directors of the petitioner-company agreed to financially support the project of the respondent-company. On the basis of the aforesaid agreement, the petitioner initially gave an inter corporate deposit of Rs. 2 crores in three instalments carrying an interest of 12 per cent. per annum. Subsequently, there were number of meetings and discussions between Mr. Pradip Burman and Mr. Dhruv Varma, managing director of the respondent-company and the petitioner continued to advance additional funds for implementation of the project. The respondent-company was accordingly, incorporated in the State of Delaware in March, 2004. Mr. Pradip Burman who was taking keen interest in the project agreed to convert the loan into equity and was appointed as director in Vasucorp Inc. USA on June 27, 2004. He continued to attend the board and management meetings in the U. S. till he resigned on December 15, 2006. It is further alleged that Mr. Pradip Burman is a party to the agreement dated July 1, 2004, to subscribe share of Vasucorp Inc. USA. Based upon mutual understanding, Vasucorp Inc. USA issued 1.05 million shares to M/s. Wogan Technologies, a corporation organised in the British Virgin Islands, and owned and controlled by Mr. Pradip Burman on August 10, 2004, at par and Mr. Dhruv Varma transferred 0.65 million shares to M/s. Wogan Technologies on March 11, 2005, at par, which was to be adjusted against the shares to be transferred in terms of the e-mails. E-mail dated May 9, 2006 from Dhruv Varma to Pradip Burman refers to discussion regarding allotment of shares in the loans given to Vasu Tech. and subscription of an additional four million shares of Vasu Tech. It also refers to primary shareholding of Vasu Tech. between Dhruv Varma and associates and Pradip Burman and associates. The aforesaid e-mail has been replied on the same date by Pradip Burman wherein details of the outstanding loans have been communicated to Mr. Dhruv Varma and also refers to payment of Rs. 2.25 crores paid to ICICI ventures for the release of shares of Vasu Tech. It also refers to primary shareholding of Vasu Tech. This also refers to the share value. There is another e-mail dated October 10, 2006 from Pradip Burman giving the outstanding position of Vasu Tech. and shares thereof. There is similar e-mail dated October 11, 2006, from Dhruv Varma to Pradip Burman dealing with the loan of Vasu Tech., as also shares due from Vasu corp. In this e-mail, Mr. Dhruv Varma is said to have confirmed the calculation in the e-mail of Pradip Burman. The respondent has further referred to a draft agreement said to be between Dhruv Varma on behalf of the Vasu Corp Inc., Vasu Tech., i.e., the respondent-company on the one hand and Pradip Burman and M/s. Wogan Technologies, on the other hand. It has been argued on behalf of the respondents that the petitioner had proposed the aforesaid agreement for allotment of shares which was not acceptable to the respondent. It is contended that there has been novation of contract.  The first novation was in November 2006, and last novation was in December 2006. It is alleged that Mr. Pradip Burman on behalf of the petitioner wanted Mr. Dhruv Varma on behalf of the respondent to sign certain agreements without any negotiation. The respondent has denied the allegation of the petitioner that the respondent has become insolvent. In paragraph 21 of the reply, it is stated that the respondent is a commercially solvent company. It also denied the allegation that the business of the respondent-company has come to a stand still. Even though the receipt of legal notice has been admitted, but its allegations have been denied. Another stand taken by the respondent is that the respondent-company filed Civil Suit (O. S.) No. 570 of 2007 in the High Court of Delhi seeking a prohibitory and mandatory injunction against the petitioner. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. It has been argued on behalf of the petitioner that the liability of loan has been admitted by the respondent as is evident from the loan agreement dated April 15, 2005, receipts (annexure P2) and the various post dated cheques issued by the respondent as also the deed of pledge (annexure P5), deed of guarantee (annexure P6) and the letter dated September 27, 2006, whereby fresh cheques for re-payment of the principal and interest were issued by the respondent. It is also argued by Mr. Makkar that even the suit filed by the respondent before the Delhi High Court itself indicates that post-dated cheques were issued by the respondent and the suit already stands withdrawn. He has also referred to the Division Bench judgment of the Delhi High Court to argue that there is no bona fide dispute regarding the payment of debt. In sum and substance, the argument is that the dispute being not bona fide, the liability having been admitted, this court cannot shirk its responsibility of initiating proceedings for winding up. Accordingly, it has been argued that the loan was advanced to the Vasu Tech Ltd., the respondent-company. All loan transactions were with the said company and there was no loan transaction with Vasucorp Inc. USA.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThough initially an interim injunction from presenting the cheques was issued, however, subsequently, the injunction was vacated by the hon'ble High Court, Delhi, vide its order dated June 15, 2007, on an appeal preferred by the petitioner.  Against the order of the hon'ble Division Bench, the respondent filed SLP. Initially, the hon'ble Supreme Court stayed the order of the hon'ble Division Bench of the Delhi High Court. \n",
    "Case_Result": "In the light of the ratio of the aforesaid judgments, the contention of Mr. Makkar is that the defence of the respondent is not bona fide and is of no substance. The dispute sought to be raised is only a device to prevent the winding up of the company.10. To the contrary, Mr. Chopra has argued that the petitioner having filed the civil suit before the civil court is not entitled to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of this court for winding up of the company.12. Mr. A. K. Chopra, learned senior advocate has vehemently argued that there has been novation of contract, in view of mutual understanding between the parties whereunder the petitioner was to be allotted shares in the US company, namely, Vasucorp Inc. USA for which detailed reference has been made to various e-mails, inter se, parties in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment. It is accordingly contended that the original loan transaction between the parties stood replaced by a new arrangement evident from the various e-mails and thus, there is no cause for filing the winding up petition nor the original loan transaction survives.It is contended that as a matter of fact, initial loan transaction between the parties has merged into a mutual arrangement for investment in the sister concern of the respondent-company, i.e., Vasucorp Inc. USA and thus, the present petition is a device to pressurise the respondent-company to succumb to the designs of the petitioner who intends to control the respondent-company with its high potential in the international market.13. In sum and substance the argument is that once there is novation of contract, the original contract ceases to operate and the parties are governed by the new arrangement. According to Mr. Chopra, in view of the new arrangements, the petitioner is only entitled to the shares as per mutual agreement and not the amount initially advanced as loan15. It is prudent to apply the aforenoted principles to the facts of the present case. It has come on record that the petitioner-company has advanced loan amount of more than Rs. 54 crores as principal carrying interest at the rate of 12 per cent. Various post dated cheques were issued by the respondent-company towards the re-payment of the loan and interest. Some of the cheques have been dishonoured and criminal proceedings under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 have been filed. The respondent-company while re-paying the amount has made deductions of TDS which itself is an acknowledgment of debt and its liability to pay the loan/interest. As a matter of fact, the respondent-company has admitted the receipt of loan and also issuance of various cheques to the petitioner-company in paragraph 8 of its reply. It has also admitted various cheques having been issued towards the payment of the loan/interest. The only defence of the respondent-company is that there has been a subsequent arrangement between the parties for investment in another company of the respondent, namely, Vasucorp Inc. USA and the loan amount was agreed to be converted into equity shares in the said company for which the novation of contract is, pleaded based upon various e-mails dealt with in detail hereinabove. However, no material has been placed on record by the respondent that number of shares equivalent to the amount of loan and interest accrued thereon have been allotted to the petitioner-company or on its behalf. The plea of novation of contract though raised, has not been substantiated on the record.To the contrary there is written loan agreement between the parties followed by various cheques issued towards its repayment. Even the attempt of the respondent-company to seek injunction against the petitioner-company from encashing the cheques issued by the respondent-company and the discharge of loan/interest has failed up to the hon'ble Supreme Court and eventually, the suit filed by the respondent-company seeking restraint order against the petitioner-company from presenting cheques for encashment has been withdrawn. The petitioner has already filed two civil suits for recovery where the leave to defend is yet to be granted by the concerned civil court. Be that as it may, the defence raised in the present petition is not substantial one. The specific plea raised in paragraphs 20 and 21 of the winding up petition that the functioning of the respondent-company has come to a stand still and it is unable to pay its debts has been simply denied by the respondent-company. No material has been placed on record to establish that its worth is equal or more than its liability and also that the company is still functioning and has substantial and sufficient resources to pay its debts. Even the balance-sheet for the relevant period has not been placed on record to rebut the specific allegations made in the winding up petition that the company is unable to pay its debts. There is huge outstanding against the respondent-company. Its substratum, the financial health and functionality has not been disclosed. Petition allowed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 636a3912256c9ffed8242ce8\n**Facts**: This appeal had arisen out of the order in C. P. No. 372 of 1997, on the file of the original side of this court. The appellant is the petitioner in C. P. No. 372 of 1997, which was filed under section 433(e) and (f) and 434 of the Companies Act, 1956, to wind up the respondent-company NEPC India Limited, 36, Wallaja Road, Chennai. According to the appellant/petitioner the share capital of the respondent is Rs. 20 crores divided into 2 crores equity shares of Rs. 10 each and the issued share capital of the respondent is Rs. 16, 19, 37, 000 divided into 1, 61, 93, 700 equity shares of Rs. 10 each. The objects of the respondent are to generate, accumulate, distribute, supply electricity and other power for the purpose of light, heat, motive power and for all other purposes for which electricity and other energy can be employed. As per the purchase order dated February 18, 1994, the respondent placed an order upon the petitioner for certain quantities of fasteners.  Between the period February 1994 and February 1996, the petitioner supplied the fasteners as ordered by the respondent and raised invoices in respect thereof, aggregating to Rs. 1, 30, 95, 769.21. The said fasteners were delivered to the respondent in good condition and they have also received the same, but have paid a sum of Rs. 59, 78, 080.72 leaving a balance of Rs. 71, 17, 688.49. The said balance amount has been acknowledged by the respondent through their letter dated August 13, 1996. In spite of repeated letters, the respondents were delaying the payments to clear the outstanding. After a long delay, the respondents issued two cheques bearing Nos. 953877 and 953878 drawn on Canara Bank dated May 29, 1996, for Rs. 5, 00, 000 each. Both the cheques, on presentation were dishonoured by the bank on June 5, 1996, with an endorsement \"insufficient funds\", and debiting an amount of Rs. 1, 300 from the petitioner's account towards bank charges. As a gesture of goodwill the petitioner had handed over the abovesaid two dishonoured cheques to the respondent-company, without resorting to criminal action under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  he petitioner had once again reminded through various letters informing the respondent-company to discharge the outstanding debt of Rs. 71, 17, 688.49. Petitioner issued notice dated July, 26, 1997, calling upon the respondent to pay a sum of Rs. 71, 17, 688.49 along with interest at the rate of 24 per cent. per annum. The said notice was statutory notice contemplated under sections 433 and 434 of the Companies Act, 1956. In their letter dated August 13, 1997, the respondent has admitted its liability and informed that it was facing a liquidity crisis and undertook to clear off the debts within a period of one month. Even thereafter, the respondent has failed to discharge the admitted debt with interest. Hence, the petitioner submits that the respondent is unable to pay its debts and is deemed to be unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act, 1956, and the respondent-company is liable to be wound up. The respondent-company is commercially insolvent and unable to pay its debts and on that ground also it is just and equitable that the respondent-company is liable to be wound up. The petitioner has also prayed for an interim order of injunction against the respondent restraining him from disposing of, alienating, encumbering, parting with possession of or creating any third party rights on or its assets and properties. Hence, the petition to wind up the respondent-company under the Companies Act, 1956 and also to appoint a liquidator to take charge of the assets, affairs, books of account, records, documents, papers, vouchers, bills, etc., and also for interim injunction.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The learned single judge, after giving due deliberations to the submissions made by learned counsel on both sides, has ultimately come to the conclusion that the appellant/petitioner is not entitled to any relief under the company petition and accordingly dismissed the company petition without costs, which necessitated the petitioner/appellant to prefer this appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the appellant would contend that after the dishonouring of the two cheques drawn by the respondent in favour of the appellant, the respondent had repaid the entire cheque amount and the amount payable was Rs. 62, 67, 688.49 only and there was a compromise entered into between the parries and under the compromise the respondent had agreed to pay a lump sum of Rs. 11, 18, 648.85 at the time of signing the memo of compromise and agreed to pay the balance amount of Rs. 51, 49, 039.64 in three equal monthly installments of Rs. 3, 67, 788.55 commencing from March, 2001, and both the parties have signed in the memo of compromise and as per clause 6 of the memo of compromise, if the respondent is making any default in paying the installments, he is liable to pay 24 per cent. per annum interest from due dates.  The grievance of the petitioner is that the learned single judge has failed to raise a proper issue for determination to the effect of compromise and failed to give a finding thereon and also as to the non-issuance of proper statutory notice under section 434(1) (a) of the Companies Act, 1956 and under rule 96 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959.\n**Argument by Respondent**: . The respondent in their counter would state that only to harass the respondent the petition has been filed and the same is an abuse of process of law. The amount claimed in the notice is unjust and dishonest claim. The respondent is a pioneer in manufacturing wind turbine generators in Asia and is a running company owning assets and the assets far exceed the liabilities. On this ground also the petition is liable to be dismissed. There are about 2 lakhs shareholders in the respondent-company and about more than 500 employees are working in the respondent-company. The statutory notice required under law was not sent to the registered office of the respondent. The statutory notice dated July, 28, 1997, sent by the petitioner to the respondent is not maintainable. The transaction between the petitioner and the respondent is under a running account and hence the company petition is not maintainable. \n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: There is a vast difference in the balance between the books of account maintained by the parties. The letter dated March 25, 1997, sent by the respondent to the petitioner and the letter dated May 5, 1997, sent by the respondent to the petitioner were deliberately suppressed by the petitioner. It has been made clear to the petitioner that the amount due under excise duty is not liable to be paid by the respondent since the fasteners supplied by the petitioner were exempted from excise duty. The wind mill itself is exempted from excise duty and all the parts required for the functioning of the wind mill are also exempted from excise duty. Materials worth more than Rs. 22 lakhs are lying on the stock of the respondent, which have to be accounted and taken back by the petitioner. The respondent has not admitted or acknowledged a sum of Rs. 71, 17, 688.49 as the amount due to the petitioner in his letter dated August 13, 1996. The respondent has made payments subsequent to August 13, 1996.  The respondent had sent a reply dated May 5, 1997, to the letter of the petitioner dated March 25, 1997, pointing out the vast difference in the balance shown in the account books of the petitioner. The notice dated July 28, 1997, was not sent to the registered office of the respondent and hence, there was no statutory notice as contemplated under law was given to this respondent before filing this company petition. The grounds stated in the petition for winding up the respondent-company are unsustainable and untenable under law. No liquidator need be appointed for the respondent-company. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed with costs. The petitioner has filed a reply statement denying the contention of the respondent in the counter. We have heard learned counsel Mr. P. R. Seetharaman appearing for the appellant and learned senior counsel Mr. T. K. Seshadri appearing for the respondent and considered their respective submissions. . In the present case we are not inclined to deliberate at this stage on the issue whether the petition under sections 433 and 434 is maintainable or not. We may only notice the Supreme Court decision, wherein the apex court has repeatedly expressed its displeasure at the conduct of a party who seeks to resile from the terms of a compromise voluntarily and knowingly entered into by him in the following decisions.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The core legal issue in this case is whether the respondent-company, Vasu Tech Ltd., is liable to wind up based on its failure to repay a loan of over Rs. 54 crores advanced by the petitioner-company, M/s. Wockhardt Limited, and whether the company is insolvent. The lower court ruled that a prima facie case for winding up was made out, and granted the petitioner leave to proceed with the winding up petition.\n\nThe key evidence presented by the petitioner includes loan agreements, post-dated cheques issued by the respondent, and a deed of pledge and guarantee. The respondent denies the allegation of insolvency, and argues that the loan agreement was part of a novation where the loan amount was to be converted into shares of Vasucorp Inc. USA.\n\nApplying the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, the lower court's decision seems to be supported by the evidence presented by the petitioner. The loan agreement, post-dated cheques, and deed of pledge and guarantee all indicate that the respondent-company owes a debt to the petitioner. The respondent's argument of novation seems weak, as there is no clear evidence of a novation agreement or the conversion of the loan into shares.\n\nTherefore, the appeal should be DISMISSED. The respondent-company, Vasu Tech Ltd., is liable to wind up based on its failure to repay the loan advanced by the petitioner-company, M/s. Wockhardt Limited."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nRespondent No.2-complainant was dealing in the business of transportation. The appellant was the General Manager of J.K. Utility Division of J.K. Synthetics Ltd. whereas the absconding accused Anup Chaturvedi was the Finance Manager. Both were working under the Managing Director Manoj Kumar Mathur.  The non-applicant and the co- accused Anup Chaturvedi placed order No.U/QMR/Coal 96028 dated 7.8.1996 with one Vinayak Coal Corporation. In pursuance of this order, the coal was transported by Maruti Road Carrier, Indore which is owned by the appellant. The transportation charges of Rs.9, 45, 000/- were paid through four cheques. All the four cheques were given to the appellant by the co- accused. 3. As per the information given by the co-accused to the appellant, the appellant placed the cheques before the Bank for encashment but the same were dishonored. All the cheques were issued on Bank of Rajasthan Branch Jhalawad. The cheques were returned dishonoured with the endorsement of 'Stop Payment'. On 28.11.1996, a registered notice was sent to the Company which was served by \"Registered Acknowledgment Due\" on 6.12.1996. Even thereafter payments were not made.  Therefore, the complaint was filed by respondent No.2 against the appellant and co- accused Anup Chaturvedi and Manoj Mathur and the case was proceeded against the appellant and absconding accused Anup Chaturvedi. 4. Respondent No.2 had stated in the complaint that appellant was working in the company. The order of transportation was placed by him, the material was received by him and the cheques were given to him by the appellant and co-accused Anup Chaturvedi. Out of four cheques, the complaint in regard to the cheque amount of Rs.2, 00, 000/- dated 12.9.1996 was not pressed because a separate complaint was filed for dishonour of this cheque. The cheques were not signed by him and a notice under Section 138 proviso (b) of the Act was not given in his name.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n6. Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there is no evidence that the appellant was in charge and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. A notice was not given to him. There was no specific role attributed to him in the complaint petition. Therefore, the conviction as recorded cannot be maintained.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n7. Learned counsel for respondent No.2-complainant supported the judgment of the High Court.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nChallenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, Indore Bench, dismissing the revision application filed by the appellant questioning his conviction for an offence relating to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (in short the 'Act'). The learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Indore, found the appellant guilty and the appeal was dismissed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Indore. Both the courts found the appellant guilty. The appellant's stand was that he was not in charge and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company and, therefore, he should not have been held guilty. The High Court did not accept the stand and dismissed the revision application.\n",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9bf7\n**Facts**: The complainant as the Managing Director of Team Finance Company Pvt. Ltd., Janpath Tower, Bhubaneswar had availed hire purchased finance from Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Limited, accused appellant No.1 with the consent and knowledge of its Managing Director, accused appellant No.2 in respect of a vehicle for a sum of Rs.1, 89, 000, 00. He had given seven blank cheques drawn on Canara Bank, Main Branch Bhubaneswar in favour of accused-appellant No.1 in the year. 1994 when the agreement had been executed between the parties with mutual understanding that the said cheques would not be presented for encashment by the accused-appellant, but then payments would be made through demand drafts regularly till the entire amount was repaid.  According to the complainant, in consonance with the said understanding the entire dues were repaid by him through demand drafts and after repayment he wrote a letter to accused-appellant No.l for returning the blank cheques to him. However, without doing so, the accused appellants mischievously and with ulterior motive presented the cheques in the bank, a fact he learnt after receiving communication from the concerned Bank, that as sufficient money was not available in his account. The cheques were presented in bank by the accused-appellants even though their entire amount had been repaid by the complainant.  This was done with a motive to cheat and harass the complainant and makes out offences under Sections 406 and 420 IPC. The court below after recording the initial statement of the complainant under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the 'Code') perusing the materials produced before him and being prima facie satisfied about commission of the aforesaid offences took cognizance thereof.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Orissa High Court declining to interfere with the order passed by learned SDJM, Bhubaneshwar in ICC 210 of 2000 taking cognizance of offence punishable under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the 'IPC'). In the complaint it was inter-alia alleged as follows: The High Court found that it is not a case for interference under Section 482 of the Code. . On 18.04.2001, the Learned Court of SDJM, Bhubaneshwar in ICC 210 of 2000 issued process against the appellants under Section 406/420 IPC.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Stand of the appellants before the High Court was that the complaint was nothing but abuse of the process of the law. It was as a counter blast to the proceedings initiated under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (in short the 'Act').  Learned counsel for the appellants, inter-alia, submitted as follows: Pursuant to the minutes of meeting dated 23.6.1995 it was agreed to enter into a tripartite Agreement between the appellant No.1-Company, the Respondent's company Team Finance Corporation Pvt. Ltd. and the customers availing the loan and buying the vehicle whereby appellant No.1 agreed to extend loans under hire and purchase/lease directly to customers with Team Finance Co. Pvt. Ltd. being the guarantor for disbursal of the said loans to the customers for which the Respondent was given a margin of 3-4% to market the loan scheme. As per clause (e) of the said minutes of the meeting and as per clause (f) the respondent had to open a separate bank account and deposit all the post dated installment cheques received from the customers in the said account which was required to be remitted to the appellant Company on minimum balance basis in its Bombay account by way of Telegraphic Transfer and as per clause (g) the respondent was required to send reports and statements on monthly basis to the appellant company. As per clause (h) for any customer once defaults in payment reached a figure of 3, the respondent had to reimburse the said defaulted installment to the appellant Company. This understanding was further reinforced as per the minutes of discussions held between the appellant and respondent on 18-07.1996 and certain additional conditions were imposed on the respondent by the appellants whereby a limit of Rs.20 lakhs was fixed for extending finance per month by the respondent. As such several tripartite loan agreements were signed and loan disbursed to the customers directly by the appellants with the Respondent being a guarantor and as on 25th March 2000, the total outstanding against respondent Team Finance Corporation Pvt. Ltd. stood at Rs.2, 39, 73, 795/- the said amount being unpaid despite several reminders to settle the outstanding amount. The appellants presented 7 cheques on 29-03-2000 bearing numbers and amounts as following:\\n\\nCheque No.\tAmount\tDated\\n7891578\t1655516/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891579\t2526794/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891580\t1477323/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891581\t722419/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891582\t19631031/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891583\t1942609/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891584\t4712236/-\t29-03-2000 he appellants presented 3 cheques on 2-08-2000 against the discharge of the remaining outstanding payments bearing the number and amounts as follows:\\n\\nCheque No.\tAmount\tDated\\n7891585\t3515726/-\t2.8.2000\\n7891586\t3530903/-\t2.8.2000\\n7891587\t1927166/-\t2.8.2000 According to the appellants the ingredients of Section 405 are not present. In any event, the plea of the respondent filing the petition mala fide is clearly borne out.\n**Argument by Respondent**: The respondent in the meanwhile kept on representing that he will clear the payments and vide letter dated 8-11-2000 made an offer to the appellants to agree for the full and final settlement of the outstanding dues for a mere sum of 25, 00, 000/- against a balance of 2, 39, 73, 795/-.  Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that the appellants have not come to this Court with clean hands.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: All these cheques were returned by the Bank to the appellants with the endorsement that the account is not valid and insufficient funds . In the meanwhile, in order to pre-empt the impending proceeding under sec 138 of the Act, the respondent filed a criminal complaint CC No. 210 of 2000 against the appellants under Sections 406, 420, 294, 506, 34 IPC before SDJM Bhubneshwar on 11-05-2000, inter-alia, claiming that the cheques issued by respondent were towards an outstanding amount of Rs.1, 89, 000/- and the said payment has already been made by the Respondent by way of a Demand Draft of which no number, date or any other details are provided in the complaint. The appellants became aware of institution of such a case only later when the process was issued on 18.04.2001 and the same was received by the appellants. . On 02-08-2000 the appellants filed Case No.753/S/2000 U/s 138 of the Act read with section 34 of IPC before ACMM, Esplanade, Bombay. The appellants have introduced a fabricated letter dated 24.6.1995. It is their stand that the entire amount was paid and, therefore, on receiving the full payment, the appellants ought to have returned the cheques which were held only as a collateral security. It is not in dispute that the proceedings under Section 138 are pending. That being so, the question of proceeding for alleged breach of trust does not arise. 7.It is interesting to note that the respondent does not dispute issuance of cheques. Even a casual reading of the complaint does not show that the ingredients of Section 406 IPC are in any event made out. It is also not understandable as to how Section 294 has any application to the facts of the case much less Section 506 IPC.In addition to this, perusal of the complaint apparently shows the ulterior motive. It is clear that the proceeding initiated by the respondent clearly amounted to abuse of the process of law\n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe appellant filed two complaints (Crl. Comp.No.58/2001 and 59/2001) in the Court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi, against M/s. Motorol Speciality Oils Ltd. ('the Company' for short) and eight others under section 138 of the Act. The first complaint was in regard to dishonour of five cheques (each for Rs.5, 00, 000/-, all dated 28.2.2001). The second complaint was in regard to dishonour of three cheques (for Rs.3 lakhs, 3 lakhs and 10 lakhs dated 31.10.2000, 30.11.2000 and 20.12.2000 respectively).  The cheques were alleged to have been drawn in favour of the appellant's proprietary concern (M/s Delhi Paints & Oil Traders) by the company represented by its Chairman. In the said complaints, the appellant had impleaded nine persons as accused, namely, the company (A-1), its Chairman (A-2), four Directors (A-3 to A-6) as also its Vice-President (Finance), General Manager and Deputy General Manager (A-7, A-8 and A- 9 respectively). In the complaint the complainant averred that \"at the time of the commission of offence, accused 2 to 9 were in-charge of and responsible for the conduct of day to day business of accused No.1\" and that therefore they were deemed to be guilty of offence under section 138 read with section 141 of the Act and section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.  The appellant also alleged that respondents 2 to 9 were directly and actively involved in the financial dealings of the company and that the accused had failed to make payment of the cheques which were dishonoured. In the pre- summoning evidence, the appellant reiterated that accused 2 to 9 were responsible for the conduct of day to day business of first accused company at the time of commission of offence.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n The appellant contends that having regard to the specific averment in the complaint that the accused 2 to 9 were in charge of and responsible for the conduct of day to day business of the company, the order summoning the first respondent could not have been quashed under section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.  It is also submitted that at the stage of summoning the accused, when evidence was yet to be led by the parties, the High Court committed an error in quashing the order summoning the first respondent, on the basis of an unwarranted assumption that the first respondent was not responsible for or involved in the conduct of the business of the company.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n. Accused no. 9 (first respondent herein) filed two petitions under section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for quashing the proceedings against him on the ground that as \"Deputy General Manager\", he was not \"in-charge of and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company\". He also contended that merely stating that he was directly and actively involved in the financial dealings of the accused or was responsible for the conduct of day to day business would not be sufficient to fasten criminal liability on him. He submitted that neither the complaint nor the sworn statement gave any particulars of the part played by him or part attributed to him in the alleged offence At the hearing before the High Court, the Learned counsel for the appellant-complainant conceded that details as to how the first respondent could be said to be \"in charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company\" were not given in the complaint or the statement on oath. It was also conceded that the averments necessary to make out an offence under section 420 IPC were not contained in the complaint. \nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe learned Magistrate by order dated 3.10.2001 directed issue of summons to all the accused. The High Court by order dated 10.10.2002 allowed the said petitions and quashed the orders summoning the first respondent on the ground that he was not a signatory to the cheques nor was a party to the decision to allow the cheques to be dishonoured. \n",
    "Case_Result": "The said order is under challenge.Having regard to section 141, when a cheque issued by a company (incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956) is dishonoured, in addition to the company, the following persons are deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished11. The criminal liability for the offence by a company under section 138, is fastened vicariously on the persons referred to in sub-section (1) of section 141 by virtue of a legal fiction. Penal statutes are to be construed strictly. Penal statutes providing constructive vicarious liability should be construed much more strictly. When conditions are prescribed for extending such constructive criminal liability to others, courts will insist upon strict literal compliance. There is no question of inferential or implied compliance.Therefore, a specific averment complying with the requirements of section 141 is imperative. As pointed out in K. Srikanth Singh vs. North East Securities Ltd - 2007 (12) SCC 788, the mere fact that at some point of time, an officer of a company had played some role in the financial affairs of the company, will not be sufficient to attract the constructive liability under section 141 of the Act.12. Sub-section (2) of section 141 provides that a Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer, though not in charge of the conduct of the business of the company will be liable if the offence had been committed with his consent or connivance or if the offence was a result of any negligence on his part.The liability of persons mentioned in sub-section (2) is not on account of any legal fiction but on account of the specific part played - consent and connivance or negligence. If a person is to be made liable under sub-section (2) of section 141, then it is necessary to aver consent and connivance, or negligence on his part.The words \"every person who, at the time of the offence was committed, was in charge of, and was responsible for the conduct of the business of the company\" occurs not only in section 141(1) of the Act but in several enactments dealing with offences by companies, to mention a few - Section 278 B of the Income-tax Act, 1961, Section 22C of Minimum Wages Act, 1948, Section 86A of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948, Section 14A of Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, Section 29 of Payment of Bonus Act, 1965, Section 40 of The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and section 47 of Water (Prevention And Control Of Pollution) Act, 1974. But neither section 141(1) of the Act, nor the pari materia provisions in other enactments give any indication as to who are the persons responsible to the company, for the conduct of the business of the company. Therefore, we will have to fall back upon the provisions of Companies Act, 1956 which is the law relating to and regulating companies. Section 291 of the said Act provides that subject to the provisions of that Act, the Board of Directors of a company shall be entitled to exercise all such powers, and to do all such acts and things, as the company is authorised to exercise and do. A company though a legal entity can act only through its Board of Directors.5. Section 141 uses the words \"was in charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company\". It is evident that a person who can be made vicariously liable under sub-section (1) of Section 141 is a person who is responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company and in addition is also in charge of the business of the company. There may be many directors and secretaries who are not in charge of the business of the company at all.16. Therefore, if a person does not meet the first requirement, that is being a person who is responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company, neither the question of his meeting the second requirement (being a person in charge of the business of the company), nor the question of such person being liable under sub-section (1) of section 141 does not arise. To put it differently, to be vicariously liable under sub- section (1) of Section 141, a person should fulfill the 'legal requirement' of being a person in law (under the statute governing companies) responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company and also fulfill the 'factual requirement' of being a person in charge of the business of the company.Therefore, the averment in a complaint that an accused is a director and that he is in charge of and is responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company, duly affirmed in the sworn statement, may be sufficient for the purpose of issuing summons to him.But if the accused is not one of the persons who falls under the category of 'persons who are responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company' (listed in para 14 above), then merely by stating that 'he was in charge of the business of the company' or by stating that 'he was in charge of the day to day management of the company' or by stating that he was in charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company', he cannot be made vicariously liable under section 141(1) of the Act.0. The position under section 141 of the Act can be summarized thusIf a mere reproduction of the wording of section 141(1) in the complaint is sufficient to make a person liable to face prosecution, virtually every officer/employee of a company without exception could be impleaded as accused by merely making an averment that at the time when the offence was committed they were in charge of and were responsible to the company for the conduct and business of the company. This would mean that if a company had 100 branches and the cheque issued from one branch was dishonoured, the officers of all the 100 branches could be made accused by simply making an allegation that they were in charge of and were responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. That would be absurd and not intended under the Act. As the trauma, harassment and hardship of a criminal proceedings in such cases, may be more serious than the ultimate punishment, it is not proper to subject all and sundry to be impleaded as accused in a complaint against a company, even when the requirements of section 138 read and section 141 of the Act are not fulfilled.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9bf7\n**Facts**: The complainant as the Managing Director of Team Finance Company Pvt. Ltd., Janpath Tower, Bhubaneswar had availed hire purchased finance from Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Limited, accused appellant No.1 with the consent and knowledge of its Managing Director, accused appellant No.2 in respect of a vehicle for a sum of Rs.1, 89, 000, 00. He had given seven blank cheques drawn on Canara Bank, Main Branch Bhubaneswar in favour of accused-appellant No.1 in the year. 1994 when the agreement had been executed between the parties with mutual understanding that the said cheques would not be presented for encashment by the accused-appellant, but then payments would be made through demand drafts regularly till the entire amount was repaid.  According to the complainant, in consonance with the said understanding the entire dues were repaid by him through demand drafts and after repayment he wrote a letter to accused-appellant No.l for returning the blank cheques to him. However, without doing so, the accused appellants mischievously and with ulterior motive presented the cheques in the bank, a fact he learnt after receiving communication from the concerned Bank, that as sufficient money was not available in his account. The cheques were presented in bank by the accused-appellants even though their entire amount had been repaid by the complainant.  This was done with a motive to cheat and harass the complainant and makes out offences under Sections 406 and 420 IPC. The court below after recording the initial statement of the complainant under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short the 'Code') perusing the materials produced before him and being prima facie satisfied about commission of the aforesaid offences took cognizance thereof.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Orissa High Court declining to interfere with the order passed by learned SDJM, Bhubaneshwar in ICC 210 of 2000 taking cognizance of offence punishable under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the 'IPC'). In the complaint it was inter-alia alleged as follows: The High Court found that it is not a case for interference under Section 482 of the Code. . On 18.04.2001, the Learned Court of SDJM, Bhubaneshwar in ICC 210 of 2000 issued process against the appellants under Section 406/420 IPC.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Stand of the appellants before the High Court was that the complaint was nothing but abuse of the process of the law. It was as a counter blast to the proceedings initiated under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (in short the 'Act').  Learned counsel for the appellants, inter-alia, submitted as follows: Pursuant to the minutes of meeting dated 23.6.1995 it was agreed to enter into a tripartite Agreement between the appellant No.1-Company, the Respondent's company Team Finance Corporation Pvt. Ltd. and the customers availing the loan and buying the vehicle whereby appellant No.1 agreed to extend loans under hire and purchase/lease directly to customers with Team Finance Co. Pvt. Ltd. being the guarantor for disbursal of the said loans to the customers for which the Respondent was given a margin of 3-4% to market the loan scheme. As per clause (e) of the said minutes of the meeting and as per clause (f) the respondent had to open a separate bank account and deposit all the post dated installment cheques received from the customers in the said account which was required to be remitted to the appellant Company on minimum balance basis in its Bombay account by way of Telegraphic Transfer and as per clause (g) the respondent was required to send reports and statements on monthly basis to the appellant company. As per clause (h) for any customer once defaults in payment reached a figure of 3, the respondent had to reimburse the said defaulted installment to the appellant Company. This understanding was further reinforced as per the minutes of discussions held between the appellant and respondent on 18-07.1996 and certain additional conditions were imposed on the respondent by the appellants whereby a limit of Rs.20 lakhs was fixed for extending finance per month by the respondent. As such several tripartite loan agreements were signed and loan disbursed to the customers directly by the appellants with the Respondent being a guarantor and as on 25th March 2000, the total outstanding against respondent Team Finance Corporation Pvt. Ltd. stood at Rs.2, 39, 73, 795/- the said amount being unpaid despite several reminders to settle the outstanding amount. The appellants presented 7 cheques on 29-03-2000 bearing numbers and amounts as following:\\n\\nCheque No.\tAmount\tDated\\n7891578\t1655516/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891579\t2526794/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891580\t1477323/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891581\t722419/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891582\t19631031/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891583\t1942609/-\t29-03-2000\\n7891584\t4712236/-\t29-03-2000 he appellants presented 3 cheques on 2-08-2000 against the discharge of the remaining outstanding payments bearing the number and amounts as follows:\\n\\nCheque No.\tAmount\tDated\\n7891585\t3515726/-\t2.8.2000\\n7891586\t3530903/-\t2.8.2000\\n7891587\t1927166/-\t2.8.2000 According to the appellants the ingredients of Section 405 are not present. In any event, the plea of the respondent filing the petition mala fide is clearly borne out.\n**Argument by Respondent**: The respondent in the meanwhile kept on representing that he will clear the payments and vide letter dated 8-11-2000 made an offer to the appellants to agree for the full and final settlement of the outstanding dues for a mere sum of 25, 00, 000/- against a balance of 2, 39, 73, 795/-.  Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that the appellants have not come to this Court with clean hands.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: All these cheques were returned by the Bank to the appellants with the endorsement that the account is not valid and insufficient funds . In the meanwhile, in order to pre-empt the impending proceeding under sec 138 of the Act, the respondent filed a criminal complaint CC No. 210 of 2000 against the appellants under Sections 406, 420, 294, 506, 34 IPC before SDJM Bhubneshwar on 11-05-2000, inter-alia, claiming that the cheques issued by respondent were towards an outstanding amount of Rs.1, 89, 000/- and the said payment has already been made by the Respondent by way of a Demand Draft of which no number, date or any other details are provided in the complaint. The appellants became aware of institution of such a case only later when the process was issued on 18.04.2001 and the same was received by the appellants. . On 02-08-2000 the appellants filed Case No.753/S/2000 U/s 138 of the Act read with section 34 of IPC before ACMM, Esplanade, Bombay. The appellants have introduced a fabricated letter dated 24.6.1995. It is their stand that the entire amount was paid and, therefore, on receiving the full payment, the appellants ought to have returned the cheques which were held only as a collateral security. It is not in dispute that the proceedings under Section 138 are pending. That being so, the question of proceeding for alleged breach of trust does not arise. 7.It is interesting to note that the respondent does not dispute issuance of cheques. Even a casual reading of the complaint does not show that the ingredients of Section 406 IPC are in any event made out. It is also not understandable as to how Section 294 has any application to the facts of the case much less Section 506 IPC.In addition to this, perusal of the complaint apparently shows the ulterior motive. It is clear that the proceeding initiated by the respondent clearly amounted to abuse of the process of law\n",

The petitioner's arguments and the evidence provided were sufficient to establish the first respondent's liability under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nIn order to appreciate the controversy, a few material facts may be stated thus: The complainant is engaged in the trading of petroleum products. According to him, the appellant, his father, brother and mother used to purchase mobile oil from him from time to time. According to the complainant, on 20th November, 2000, all four of them got issued a cheque bearing No. 227739 drawn on Indian Bank, Sonepat in the sum of Rs.24, 92, 115/- in discharge of their liability towards him. The complainant presented the cheque for payment to his bankers, which was returned unpaid on 29th December, 2000 with the remarks \"Account closed\". Thereafter, on 17th January, 2001, the complainant got a legal notice issued to all the four accused asking them to pay the cheque amount. In their reply to the legal notice, the accused denied having any business dealings with the complainant as also the issue of cheque in question by any one of them. Their stand was that no such cheque was ever signed, issued or got issued by them at any point of time in favour of the complainant.  Dissatisfied with the response to the legal notice, the complainant filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Act against the afore-noted four persons. Paragraph 3 of the complaint, which contains the gist of complainant's case and has a bearing on the issue involved in this appeal, reads as follows:\\n\\n\"That the complainant handed over the cheque No. 227739, dt. 20.11.2000 of Indian Bank, Sonepat to its banker Oriental Bank of Commerce, Samalkha for the collection of the amount of aforesaid cheque after about one month as requested by the complainants. But the Indian Bank, Sonepat returned the said cheque with the remarks \"Account closed\" vide return memo dated 29.12.2000. The return memo dated 29.12.2000 alongwith original cheque was returned by the O.B.C., Samalkha alongwith its forwarding letter dt. 03.01.2001 to the complainant vide which the O.B.C., Samalkha also informed that a sum of Rs.3136/- has been debited in the complainant's account as collection charges. After receiving the return memo alongwith forwarding 03.01.2001, the complainant came to know for the first time that the accused have issued the aforesaid cheque dt. 20.11.2000 with a fraudulent intention knowing fully well that the accused have no sufficient amount for the encashment of the aforesaid cheque or the said account was not in existence on that date or the said account pertained to someone else. The complainant has also came to know that all the above named accused being a family members, formed an unlawful group to play fraud with the public and there was several other instances.\"\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the High Court gravely erred in declining to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code in a case where the complaint ex facie lacked the basic ingredients of the offence under Section 138 of the Act for which the appellant has been made to stand trial. It was contended that admittedly, the cheque in question, purportedly issued by the appellant, was from an account not maintained by him with the Indian Bank but by one Ms. Shilpa Chaudhary and therefore, the basic ingredient of Section 138 of the Act was missing. It was also urged that since the said bank account had already been closed on 3rd November, 2000, there was no question of the subject cheque being issued in favour of the complainant by the appellant on 20th November, 2000. It was pleaded that the filing of the complaint under the said provision is an abuse of the process of the Court and therefore, the High Court ought to have quashed the complaint.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nPer contra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the complainant, supported the impugned order and submitted that having issued the cheque to the complainant under his signatures by making a false representation that the account was maintained by him, the appellant had duped the complainant. It was contended that at this juncture the question whether or not the cheque was issued by the appellant is pre-mature as the same would be determined only after the evidence has been led by the parties. Learned counsel thus, argued that the appellant having played a fraud on the complainant, does not deserve any relief.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n2. This appeal arises from the judgment and order dated 13th December, 2005 rendered by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 47932-M of 2004.  By the impugned judgment, the learned Judge, while partly allowing the petition preferred under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short \"the Code\") seeking quashing of a private complaint filed by the respondent (hereinafter referred to as \"the complainant\") under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short \"the Act\") has dismissed the petition qua the appellant. The Chief Judicial Magistrate, Panipat took cognizance of the complaint and vide order dated 20th September, 2003, directed issue of notice to all the accused. All the accused put in appearance; notice of accusation was given; they pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Thereafter, all the four accused filed petition under Section 482 of the Code praying for quashing of the complaint.  As noted earlier, by a short order, the High Court has dismissed the petition qua accused No.1, the appellant herein, on the ground that the plea of the appellant that the cheque was not issued by him involved a disputed question of fact which could not be gone into by the Court in proceedings under Section 482 of the Code. As regards the rest of three accused petitioners, the learned Judge allowed the petition holding that neither the cheque had been issued by them nor they had been shown to be vicariously liable under Section 141 of the Act. \n",
    "Case_Result": "Aggrieved by the said decision, the appellant has come up in appeal before us.It is true that Section 138 of the Act was enacted to punish unscrupulous drawers of cheques who, though purport to discharge their liability by issuing cheque, have no intention of really doing so, yet to fasten a criminal liability under the said provision, necessary ingredients of the Section are to be satisfied. It is manifest that to constitute an offence under Section 138 of the Act, the following ingredients are required to be fulfilled:(i) a person must have drawn a cheque on an account maintained by him in a bank for payment of a certain amount of money to another person from out of that account;\n\n(ii) The cheque should have been issued for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability;\n\n(iii) that cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity whichever is earlier;\n\n(iv) that cheque is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of the account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with the bank;\n\n(v) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within 15 days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid;\n\n(vi) the drawer of such cheque fails to make payment of the said amount of money to the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque within 15 days of the receipt of the said notice;. Being cumulative, it is only when all the afore-mentioned ingredients are satisfied that the person who had drawn the cheque can be deemed to have committed an offence under Section 138 of the Act. In the case before us, it is clear from the facts, briefly noted above, and in para 3 of the complaint as extracted, that on receipt of the return memo from the bank, the complainant is stated to have realized that the dishonoured cheque was issued from an account which was not maintained by accused No.1--the appellant herein, but by one Shilpa Chaudhary. As a matter of fact and perhaps having gained the said knowledge, on 20th January, 2001, the complainant filed an FIR against all the accused for offences under Sections 420, 467, 468, 471, 406 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). Thus, there is hardly any dispute that the cheque, subject matter of the complaint under Section 138 of the Act, had not been drawn by the appellant on an account maintained by him in the Indian Bank, Sonepat branch. That being so, there is little doubt that the very first ingredient of Section 138 of the Act, enumerated above, is not satisfied and consequently the case against the appellant for having committed an offence under Section 138 of the Act cannot be proved.17. As already noted hereinbefore, in para 3 of the complaint, there is a clear averment that the cheque in question was issued from an account which was non-existent on the day it was issued or that the account from where the cheque was issued \"pertained to someone else\".As per complainant's own pleadings, the bank account from where the cheque had been issued, was not held in the name of the appellant and therefore, one of the requisite ingredients of Section 138 of the Act was not satisfied. Under the circumstances, continuance of further proceedings in the complaint under Section 138 of the Act against the appellant, would be an abuse of the process of the Court. Appeal allowed",

The main issue of the case is whether the cheque issued by the appellant falls under the purview of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, given that it was from an account not maintained by him with the Indian Bank and since the said bank account had already been closed on 3rd November, 2000. The lower court dismissed the petition qua accused No.1 (appellant), holding that a disputed question of fact was involved.\n\n2. Assessing the lower court's judgment, the core legal question is whether the appellant can be held liable under Section 138 of the Act for issuing a cheque knowing it will be dishonored. The section requires that the account should be one in which the person writing the cheque or draft knows to his credit will not be enough to honor the cheque or draft when presented for payment. In this case, the appellant's argument that the cheque was not issued by him from his closed account is a matter of fact. However, the complainant's argument that the appellant had duped him by issuing the cheque under his signatures is a matter of inference that can be drawn from the evidence.

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe petitioners were being prosecuted on the complaint of the opposite party no. 2 before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, 16th Court, Calcutta in Case No. C-5430 of 2003 under Section 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  Prosecution Case was closed upon cross-examination of the witnesses on behalf of the complainant and at the stage of examination of the accused under Section 313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 an application was filed by the complainant for recalling P.W. 1 in order to prove of Power of Attorney on the strength of which he filed the petition of complaint against the petitioners That application was resisted by the petitioners on the ground that to facilitate re-examination of P.W. 1 in order to have on record a purported Power of Attorney would virtually amount to allowing the complainant to fill up lacuna which the law does not permit and which would be prejudicial to the interest of the accused. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\nIt was the contention of the petitioners before the learned trial court as also in this court that the complainant stated that on the basis of a letter of authorization by one Sharat Deorah he lodged the complaint and was accordingly deposing on behalf of the complainant who is M/s. Auro Laboratories Ltd. Mr. Sandipan Ganguly, learned advocate appearing for the petitioners argued that if according to the complainant letter of authorization was sufficient to enable P.W. 1 to lodge complaint and to examine himself, then the Power of Attorney will not be at all necessary, but Power of Attorney and the letter of authorization which are two distinct documents cannot be said to have been executed by one and the same person and in order to bolster the case or to fill up the lacuna re-examination is sought for by the complainant that will have the effect of causing prejudice to the accused. Mr. Ganguly raised the point that if Mr. Mahendra Kumar Daga was authorized to file complaint by Mr. Sharat Deorah then definitely there has to be a resolution by the Directors to authorize Mr. Mahendra Kumar Daga to file complaint on behalf of the company and Mr. Sharat Deorah who is one of the Directors of the company cannot unilaterally take any action to authorize Mr. Daga to file complaint. \nArgument by the Respondent:\nMs. Sutapa Sanyal, learned advocate appearing for the opposite party no. 2 submitted that unless prejudice is caused, unless proposed re-examination of P.W. 1 is considered absolutely useless, this court must not exercise its inherent jurisdiction to disturb the Magisterial order who in his wisdom chose not to shut evidence which was really necessary. Ms. Sanyal produced before me a copy of the petition praying for recalling P.W. 1 which shows the questions proposed to be put to P.W. 1 by way of re-examination are (i) how P.W. 1 was authorized by the company and (ii) who has authorized him and on what basis? Petition of complaint was filed by the company to be represented by Mahendra Kumar Daga said to be the authorized representative of the company.  This is as it appears in the cause title in the petition of complaint. At para 1 of the petition of complaint it has been stated that the complainant is the authorized representative of M/s. Auro Laboratories Ltd. Before the learned Trial Court admittedly a letter of authorization was produced which was marked Exbt. 1. Copy of the letter of authorization has been produced before this court which shows that one Sharat Deorah, the Director of M/s. Auro Laboratories Ltd. authorized Mahendra Kumar Daga to file a case under Section 138 against the petitioners. At the time of the hearing of the petition of recall of P.W. 1 the Power of Attorney was produced before the learned Magistrate, a copy of which is here also and the Power of Attorney reveals that the same person Mr. Sharat Deorah who is one of the Directors of M/s. Auro Laboratories Ltd. was executing the Power of Attorney in favour of Mr. Mahendra Kumar Daga to lodge complaint on behalf of the company. Therefore, the person who issued letter of authorization and the person who executed the Power of Attorney on the same day as 12th of September, 2003 is one and same person and it is not that two different persons have executed two documents in favour of P.W. 1. \nRuling by the Lower Court:\nLearned Trial Court while allowing the petition observed that letter of authorization on the basis of which P.W. 1 had lodged the complaint and was examined was already marked Exbt. 1 and if Power of Attorney to the same effect is proved by P.W. 1 through reexamination it will not be prejudicial to the accused. The Power of Attorney was produced before the learned Magistrate who observed that the document itself showed that it was executed on 12th of September, 2003 on which date the letter of authorization was also executed.  Thus, according to the learned Magistrate the Power of Attorney was the document that came into existence before the lodgment of the case; as such the petition was allowed.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Whether Mr. Sharat Deorah was authorized to issue a letter of authorization empowering Mr. Mahendra Kumar Daga to lodge complaint on behalf of the company by any resolution of the Board of Directors or whether Mr. Sharat Deorah was authorized to issue a Power of Attorney on behalf of the company is a matter that can be ventilated when P.W. 1 was proposed to be reexamined through cross examination. At the present stage it appears prima facie that letter of authorization and Power of Attorney were executed by Mr. Sharat Deorah to empower Mr. Mahendra Kumar Daga to file complaint. Application dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9a0f\n**Facts**: 2. The petitioner is challenging the order dated 7.12.2019 on the file of VI Additional Small Causes Judge & 31st Addl.C.M.M., Bengaluru City, in C.C.No.1431/2018. By the impugned order, the trial court rejected the application of the petitioner/accused filed under Section 311 Cr.P.C. for further cross-examination of PW-1. 3. On the complaint of the respondent, the petitioner is facing prosecution in C.C.No.1431/2018 before the trial court for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. 4. The respondent alleged that the petitioner issued a cheque for Rs. 3,00,000/- without making arrangements for realization of the same, thereby cheated him.  The respondent was examined before the trial court as PW-1 and was cross-examined. Thereafter the respondent produced certain documents and on his application, he was further examined in chief on 10.6.2019. On that day, on the request of the petitioner, the matter was adjourned to 27.6.2019 for further cross-examination of PW-1. Thereafter till 26.9.2019 though the matter was listed from time to time, the petitioner did not cross-examine PW-1. Therefore, the trial court discharged the witness on 26.9.2019. The petitioner filed an application under Section 311 Cr.P.C. to recall PW-1 for further cross-examination. \n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The trial court by the impugned order rejected the said application on the ground that despite granting sufficient opportunity, the petitioner did not do the needful and having regard to the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Indian Bank Association and Others -vs- Union of India and Others (2014) 5 SCC 590, the matter has to be concluded within the time frame specified in the said judgment.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner should have given an opportunity to cross-examine PW-1 with reference to the documents produced by him subsequently, otherwise his defence was going to be prejudiced. In his application, the petitioner claimed that his Counsel was engaged before some other court, therefore, he could not do the needful. Such contention may not be a justifiable contention. \n**Argument by Respondent**: Learned Counsel for the respondent seriously opposes the application on the ground that the petitioner was guilty of procrastination and deserves no indulgence.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: However, the fact remains that the omission on the part of the counsel should not prejudice the defence of the accused. If the petitioner was not permitted to cross-examine PW-1 for the fault of others, that may lead to failure of justice.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "DISMISSED\n\nThe main issue of the case revolves around the admissibility of a Power of Attorney (POA) to be produced during the re-examination of the complainant witness (PW1) in a case filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The lower court allowed the petition for recalling PW1 to prove the POA, reasoning that it would not be prejudicial to the accused.\n\nUpon critical assessment, it is evident that the lower court's decision is not in accordance with the law. Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act requires the complaint to be signed by the holder in order to invoke criminal proceedings against the accused. In this case, the complainant PW1 claims to have been authorized by a letter of authority and a Power of Attorney (POA) to file the complaint. The lower court's decision to allow the POA to be produced during re-examination contradicts the law, as it would effectively allow the complainant to fill a legal lacuna and cause prejudice to the accused.\n\nThe provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act are clear that the complaint must be signed by the holder of the dishonored cheque. Allowing the production of a POA during re-examination would essentially mean that the complainant can circumvent the legal requirement, leading to an inconsistency in the interpretation and application of the law.\n\nHence, the appeal should be dismissed, as the lower court's decision to allow the production of the POA during re-examination is contrary to the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. This inconsistency has the potential to cause prejudice to the accused, which is not in the interest of justice."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nAppellant kept two blank cheques in his office along with some stamp papers. They were said to have been stolen from his office. Information as regards missing of the said cheques was also given to the bank. He lodged a First Information Report with regard thereto, stating: \"...On my return to Digras, I found that the cheques and the stamp worth Rs. 50 bearing only my signatures had been stolen, therefore, to prevent any misuse of my cheques, I sent a written information to State Bank, Branch Digras and subsequently on 21-04-01 I filed a complaint in Police Station Digras....\" The blank cheques were allegedly filled up on 24.06.2001. They were presented before the bank but the same were returned dishonoured with the remarks \"said cheque reported lost by the drawer\". It is furthermore not in dispute that the appellant in the meanwhile filed a complaint petition under Section 380 read with Sections 34, 467, 468 and 471 as also Sections 420 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 in the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class and the same is pending adjudication. Admittedly, the appellant had lodged a First Information Report under Sections 369, 495, 498, 420 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 with the Police Station Digras against the respondent No. 2 and his brother, wherein also a closer report has been submitted. Appellant has filed another criminal complaint against the respondent No. 2 under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which has also been dismissed on the ground that the dispute is of civil nature. 5. Appellant has moreover filed a suit for recovery of a sum of Rs.31, 40, 131.43 in the Court of Civil Judge, Sr. Division, Darwha, Madhya Pradesh against the respondent No. 2 and his brother. Several other applications were filed by the appellant before the said court to which we need not advert to. 6. Appellant filed an application under Section 482 of the Code in the High Court of Delhi praying for quashing of the proceedings under Section 138 of the Act on or about 6.09.2007 on the premise that the same was not maintainable.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n7. Mr. M.N. Krishnamani, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, would submit that the High Court committed a serious error in passing the impugned judgment insofar as it failed to take into consideration that the complaint petition even if given face value and taken to be correct in its entirety does not disclose an offence under Section 138 of the Act.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nRespondent No. 2 thereafter upon issuance of notices in terms of the proviso appended to Section 138 of the Act filed a complaint petition in the Court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi, inter alia, alleging \"5. That the above said cheque in question was presented by the complainant for encashment through its bearers, namely State Bank of India, Azadpur Branch, Delhi - 33, but the same was returned as dishonoured with the remarks \"SAID CHEQUE REPORTED LOST BY THE DRAWER\". This intimation was received by the complainant from the bankers on 27.7.2001 and accordingly a notice dt. 3.8.2001 was sent to the accused requesting the accused to make payment of the above said cheque amount and on 17.8.2001 the accused sent reply through his Advocate denying his liability falsely taking the plea that the cheque in question was lost as stolen by the complainant... 6. That the accused has taken the above said false pleas knowing it fully well that he does not intend to make payment of the said cheque amount, and the complainant is thus compelled to file this complaint. 7. That the issuance of the cheque by the accused and informing wrongly his own bankers about the loss/ theft of the cheque, with no intention to make payment thereof, rather showing that right from the time he issued the cheque, he had intention to cheat and defraud the complainant by making false representations and thus the accused has willfully committed an offence punishable under Sections 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 read with Section 420 Indian Penal Code, 1860 and is liable to be punished accordingly.\" 8. Mr. Gulshan Rai Nagpal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent No. 2, on the other hand, would contend that the appellant had lodged a false First Information Report with regard to the purported theft of the cheques which having been found to be not true and, thus, it is evident that he had resorted to various proceedings to pre-empt the drawee of the cheques to obtain lawful payments due from him.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n It arises out of a judgment and order dated 18.09.2007 passed by the High Court of Delhi in Criminal M.C. No. 2890 of 2007. By reason of the impugned judgment, the said application has been dismissed.\n",
    "Case_Result": "3. The said question arises in the following factual matrix.4. It is not in dispute that the Superintendent of Police, Digras has issued a certificate showing that FIR No. 57 of 2003 arising out of the First Information Report filed by the appellant before the Station House Officer, Digras had been closed.10. A bare perusal of the aforementioned provision would clearly go to show that by reason thereof a legal fiction has been created. A legal fiction, as is well known, although is required to be given full effect, has its own limitations. It cannot be taken recourse to for any purpose other than the one mentioned in the statute itself.11. Section 138 of the Act moreover provides for a penal provision. A penal provision created by reason of a legal fiction must receive strict construction.Such a penal provision, enacted in terms of the legal fiction drawn would be attracted when a cheque is returned by the bank unpaid. Such non-payment may either be: (i) because of the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque, or (ii) it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with that bank.Before a proceeding thereunder is initiated, all the legal requirements therefor must be complied with. The court must be satisfied that all the ingredients of commission of an offence under the said provision have been complied with.13. Before us a contention has been raised that the appellant did not have sufficient funds in his bank account. Such an allegation has not been made in the complaint petition. In any event, it was for the bank only to say so, as the complainant is not supposed to have knowledge in regard to the amount available in the account of the appellant. Appeal allowed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9b6d\n**Facts**: . The appellant aggrieved by the order dated 09.02.2009, passed in C.C.No.1837/2008, has filed the present appeal. Brief facts of the case are as under: The appellant, respondent and wife of the respondent - Smt. Nalini A. Prabhu were known to each other for a long time and they are all employees of BHEL, Bengaluru. That the respondent and his wife approached the appellant in the month of January 2005 and requested to lend a sum of Rs.6,00,000/-. The appellant paid a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent in the month of January 2005.  Thereafter, when the appellant demanded to repay the said amount, the respondent issued four cheques bearing Nos.032551, 032552, 032553 and 032554, dated 16.07.2017, amounting to Rs.50,000/- each. The appellant presented the said cheques for encashment and the said cheques were returned on the ground \"insufficient funds\", vide endorsement dated 25.07.2007. After the receipt of endorsement, the appellant issued a legal notice dated 22.08.2007. The said notice was served on the respondent. But the respondent has not replied to the same.  Therefore, the appellant was forced to file a complaint on 26.09.2007, under Section 200 of Cr.P.C., for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('the N.I. Act' for short). The Trial Court recorded the sworn statement of the appellant. Cognizance was taken against the respondent. The respondent, on receiving summons, appeared before the court and was enlarged on bail. He did not plead guilt and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court posted the matter for trial. The appellant, in support of his complaint, got examined himself as PW-1 and three witnesses as PWs. 2 to 4 and got marked 25 documents as Exs.P1 to P13. The respondent, in support of his defense, examined himself as DW-1 and got marked one document as Ex.D1.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The Trial Court, after appreciating the materials on record, acquitted the respondent under Section 255(1) of Cr.P.C. Against the said order, the appellant has filed the present appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant has lent Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent by borrowing the said amount from PWs.2 to 4. The appellant has examined PWs.2 to 4 to prove that he has borrowed money from them and he has got financial capacity to lend the amount. But the Trial Court has failed to consider the evidence of PWs.2 to 4 and also Exs.P18 to 25.\n**Argument by Respondent**: . Learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned order.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: . Heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused the records The appellant has failed to prove that he has got the financial capacity to lend money to the respondent. PW-2, who is related to the appellant, has deposed that he has paid amount to the appellant on various dates in the year 2004. But, PW-2 does not state that the amount alleged to have been paid to the appellant, was advanced to the respondent and in the course of cross- examination, he clearly admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. The evidence of PW-2 does not support the case of the appellant to show that the amount has been advanced by PW-2 to the appellant. Further, PW-3 in his evidence has deposed that the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- and paid the same to the respondent, as the appellant and respondent were close friends. He has further deposed that the appellant has actually borrowed money from other people to arrange and give the same to the respondent. Even PW-3 had also paid a sum of Rs.25,000/- to the appellant. During the course of his cross-examination, PW-3 admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. PW-3 does not disclose the date as on which the alleged amount was paid by him to the appellant.  Coming to the evidence of PW-4, who is said to be an eyewitness to the alleged transaction, he deposes that the alleged transaction took place between the appellant and the respondent in his presence and the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/-, including an amount of Rs.30,000/- paid by PW-4 to the appellant. Even PW-4 does not speak about the date of alleged transaction. During the course of cross- examination, he admits that the appellant is his close friend. The evidence of PWs.2 to 4 do not prove that the appellant has advanced a loan of Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent. If the evidence of PW-1 is perused, it is evident that he himself has borrowed money from Canara Bank and he has not repaid the said amount. Further the appellant has also admitted that he has raised loan from Syndicate Bank and Nikhara Finance. Nikhara Finance had filed a criminal case against him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act and in the said criminal proceedings, the appellant was convicted by imposing fine of Rs.1,00,000/-. He further admits that the said fine amount has been paid by the respondent, on his behalf. Further PW-1 admits that he has borrowed housing loan of Rs.13,00,000/- from SBI, Rajarajeshwari Nagar. In addition, the appellant has admitted that he had borrowed a sum of Rs.1,25,000/- from BHEL Credit Co-op. Society and that he has to pay a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- to Canara Bank towards loan repayment. When the appellant was unable to repay the loan amounts raised by him, question of he advancing loan to the respondent, does not arise. Further the appellant has not explained in the complaint or in the legal notice or in his evidence as to what made him to receive 4 cheques on 16.07.2007. The appellant has admitted in his cross-examination that the respondent and his wife have stood as guarantors for the loan obtained by him from Canara Bank. It clearly goes to show that the alleged cheques were issued by the respondent for security purpose to obtain loan by the appellant, where the respondent and his wife stood as guarantors. The appellant, taking undue advantage, misused the cheques and has filed the present complaint. The appellant in order to prove that he has got financial capacity to lend the amount, has not produced any documents. On the contrary, he has admitted in his cross-examination that he has borrowed money from different financial institutions. He has also admitted that he has not repaid the said amounts. When he himself is a defaulter, question of he advancing the amount to the respondent, does not arise.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue in the case is whether the lower court correctly ruled on the validity of the complaint filed against the appellant under Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. The lower court dismissed the application filed by the appellant for quashing the proceedings, reasoning that the complaint petition disclosed an offence under Section 138.\n\nUpon critical assessment, it is evident that the lower court erred in its judgment. The complaint petition, even if given face value and taken to be correct in its entirety, does not disclose an offence under Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. The appellant had lodged a First Information Report with the police regarding the alleged theft of the cheques, and he had also filed a criminal complaint against the respondent under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code. These facts indicate that the appellant had taken necessary steps to establish the genuineness of the theft, and therefore, the presumption of dishonour of the cheques under Section 139 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act is not applicable.\n\nHence, the appeal should be allowed, and the ruling of the lower court should be set aside. The complaint filed against the appellant under Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act should be quashed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThese two applications under Section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 Code raise a common question relating to tenability of a complaint filed after the prescribed period of limitation, by presenting the cheque again after first dishonour, in respect of offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The applicants in both these cases are accused before the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Nagpur in Criminal Complaint Nos.2337 and 2339 of 2005. Criminal Complaint bearing No.2337 of 2005 was filed in respect of cheque Nos.272309, 274088 and 274086 issued by the applicant in favour of the complainant. Criminal Complaint No.2339 of 2005 is in respect of Cheque No.279014 likewise issued by the applicant in favour of the original complainant. In the complaints filed, the cheques were shown to have been presented by the complainant on 5-8-2005 and 6-8-2005.  They were dishonoured and an intimation of dishonour was received by the complainant. On 1-9-2005, the notices were sent to the applicants by the complainant demanding the amounts under the cheques. These notices were duly received by the present applicants.  The present applicants, however, failed to comply with the demand within a period of 15 days from the receipt of notice and, therefore, the complainant filed two complaints within a month thereafter The applicants challenged the said orders by preferring revisions bearing No.420 of 2006 and 421 of 2006 before the Court of Session at Nagpur. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\nIt was contended that the complainant had suppressed the fact that before issuance of notice dated 1-9-2005, two earlier notices were issued on 28-3-2005 in respect of three cheques and on 25-7-2005 in respect of cheque No.279014. However, the complaint were not filed in spite of non-compliance with the said notice. Therefore, according to the applicant, presentation of the cheques for the second time and its second dishonour and subsequent issuance of second notices would not bring the complainant's case within limitation.  The original complainant/non-applicant contended that the issuance of notice is required to be proved by leading evidence The learned counsel for the applicant submitted that it is settled position of law that cause of action to file a complaint for offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 gets crystallized the moment a notice demanding the amount of cheque dishonoured is issued.  Upon failure of the drawer to pay the amount of money of the cheque within 15 days from the date of receipt of notice, the limitation starts running and in view of the provisions of Section 142(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, such complaint has to be filed within one month from the date of accrual of this cause of action. Now in this case, since the notices had already been issued on 28-3-2005 and 25-7-2005 and since the applicant had not paid the amounts demanded by the said notices within 15 days from the receipt of such notices, the cause of action to file the complaints had already accrued and the complaints ought to have been filed within a period of one month after accrual of such cause of action.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe learned counsel for the original complainant, relying on a judgment of the Supreme Court in S.L. Construction & Anr. v. Alapati Srinivasa Roa and another, reported at 2008(15) Scale 308, submitted that a complaint could be filed after failure of the accused to comply with the last notice.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nOn these averments, after examining the complainant, the learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Nagpur, directed issuance of process against the present applicants. The learned Additional Sessions Judge, however, dismissed the petitions holding that the question whether the complainant had issued notices prior to 1-9-2005 was required to be decided on merits, presumably on facts. \n",
    "Case_Result": "Aggrieved thereby, the applicants are before this Court.4. Upon issuance of notice, the non-applicant appeared, but had failed to deny in the reply that the two earlier notices on 28-3-2005 and 25-7-2005 in respect of the four cheques had been issued.This stand is impermissible, since it was necessary for the non-applicant to respond to the contentions in para 2 of the application, which specifically refers to issuance of earlier notices.Be that as it may, the learned counsel for the non-applicant, in course of his oral submissions, did not dispute the fact that the complainant had earlier issued the two notices. The submission of the applicant on oath about two earlier notices not having been rebutted, it has to be held that two notices had been issued prior to issuance of notices dated 1-9-2005.It may thus be seen that the Court had held in S.L. Construction that earlier notices had not at all been served, the first notice having not been served and the second having been withdrawn. Therefore, the presentation of the cheque for the third time and issuance of notice upon its dishonour thereafter were held to give rise to fresh cause of action. Such is not the present case.In the cases before this Court,earlier notices dated 28-3-2005 and 25-7-2005 had been duly received by the applicant. Therefore, the cause of action had crystallized and it was incumbent upon the complainant to file complaints before the Magistrate within a month of failure of the applicant to comply with the notices.The complainant's filing complaint on the basis of the subsequent dishonour and consequent notice without even bothering to refer to the earlier presentation of the cheque and issuance of notices was impermissible. The learned Additional Sessions Judge ought to have seen that uncontroverted allegations in the revision application would imply that the fact of issuance of first two notices was not disputed by the complainant Applications Allowed",

The applicant's argument that the earlier notices issued on 28-3-2005 and 25-7-2005 should have led to filing of complaints within one month from the date of accrual of cause of action is correct. The Supreme Court decision in S.L. Construction & Anr. v. Alapati Srinivasa Roa and another, reported at 2008(15) S.C. 308, supports the applicant's position. Since the notices in this case were issued before 1-9-2005, the complaints filed after the prescribed period of limitation are not tenable. Consequently, the appeals are allowed, and the orders of the lower courts are set aside."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n3. A perusal of the record shows that while he was working as clerk at Chengannur branch of Federal Bank Limited (for short \"the bank\"), the complainant-respondent introduced one Mr. M. P. Anil Kumar who opened savings bank account in that branch with account no.12291. On 3.4.2000. the respondent presented a cheque drawn in his favour by Anil Kumar for a sum of Rs.9.85 lakhs before Kunchithanni branch of the bank for collection and crediting the same in his account. It is worth mentioning that on the date of issue of cheque. Anil Kumar had less than Rs.150/- in his account.  The cheque was sent for collection to Chengannur branch of the bank through M/s. Professional Couriers but the same was lost in transit. The respondent complained to the Manager of Kunchithanni branch of the bank about non-credit of Rs.9.85 lakhs in his account and then filed a petition before the Banking Ombudsman for the State of Kerala. The Manager of the Kunchithanni branch of the bank, vide his letter dated 5th June. 2000, informed the respondent that the cheque was lost in transit and advised him to get a duplicate cheque in lieu of the lost instrument. Thereafter, the Banking Ombudsman issued communication dated 10th July, 2000 to the respondent that there was no deficiency of service on the part of the bank and that he may take necessary steps to obtain duplicate cheque from the drawer by invoking Section 45-A of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 or approach a court/ appropriate forum for recovery of the money. However, instead of taking steps for obtaining duplicate cheque from the drawer, namely, Anil Kumar, the respondent filed a complaint before the State Commission claiming Rs.9.85 lakhs with interest @ 18% per annum. The bank contested the complaint by asserting that there was no deficiency of service because it had asked the complainant to obtain duplicate cheque which he failed to do. The bank also questioned the bona fides of the complainant-respondent by alleging that on the date of issue of cheque the drawer had a negligible amount of Rs. 112/ - in his account.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel for the appellant invited our attention to the zerox copy of the statement of account of Anil Kumar to show that between 28th March, 1998 and 29th September, 2000 he did not deposit any amount in the bank; that outstanding balance as on 28th March, 1998 was Rs.148/- and as on 29th September, 1998 total balance amount was Rs.87/- to his credit, and argued that the State Commission committed grave illegality in awarding interest to the complainant-respondent by presuming deficiency of service on the part of the appellant and ignoring the stark reality that on the date of presentation of the cheque and five months thereafter, there was no possibility of its encashment. He pointed out that in spite of the communications of the bank and letter dated 10th July, 2000 of the Banking Ombudsman, the respondent did not take steps to obtain duplicate cheque from the drawer apparently because he knew that the drawer did not have the requisite money for encashment of the cheque and argued the award of interest on Rs.9.85 lakhs, by the State Commission which has been confirmed by the National Commission is legally unsustainable.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nAs against this, learned counsel for the respondent supported the impugned orders and argued that the State Commission has not committed any error by awarding interest in lieu of the loss suffered by his client due to the appellant's failure to credit the cheque amount in his account.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n2. This appeal is directed against order dated 10th April, 2007 passed by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short \"the National Commission\") whereby it dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellant against the order dated 3.4.2002 of the Kerala State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (for short \"the State Commission\") for award of interest @ 18% to the complainant-respondent on an amount of Rs.9.85 lakhs. 4. The State Commission declined the respondent's prayer for award of Rs.9.85 lakhs but directed the bank to pay interest @ 18% per annum on the cheque amount from the date of its issue, i.e.. 03.04.2000 till the date of payment.  The National Commission dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellant and confirmed the order of the State Commission. Hence this appeal by special leave.\n",
    "Case_Result": "We have considered the respective submissions. In our view the State Commission was not at all justified in awarding interest to the respondent. Undisputedly the drawer, namely, Anil Kumar did not deposit any amount in the bank between 28th March, 1998 and the date on which the cheque is said to have been issued in favour of the respondent. Therefore, it was impossible for the respondent to get the amount credited in his account. If the cheque had not been lost in transit, the same would have been dishonoured due to insufficiency of funds. On its part, the bank had advised the respondent to obtain duplicate cheque from the drawer. Banking Ombudsman gave similar advise to the respondent by pointing out that he can get duplicate cheque by resorting to Section 45-A of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.However, the respondent did not take any steps whatsoever for obtaining duplicate cheque from Anil Kumar. The reason for this is not far to see. Anil Kumar had sum less than Rs.200/- in his account at the relevant time. The appellant was aware of this and, therefore, he did not resort to Section 45-A of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Not only this, he did not take any action for recovery of Rs.9.85 lakhs from Anil Kumar either by filing a complaint before appropriate forum or by filing a suit before the competent civil court Appeal allowed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9841\n**Facts**: 1. The appellant filed a complaint before the V Additional I Civil Judge and JMFC, Mysuru, under section 200 read with section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"N.I. Act\") alleging that the respondent (hereinafter referred to as the \"accused\") approached him for financial assistance for his oats feeds (horse feeds) business and borrowed a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- on 18.10.2007 through cheque bearing No.488842 of State Bank of India agreeing to repay the same with interest at 18% per annum within 3 or 4 months. The accused did not return the loan amount within the stipulated time, instead again approached the complainant in the first week of June, 2008 seeking further financial assistance to the tune of Rs.25,00,000/-. As per the assurance given by the accused to repay the same along with the previous loan amount within one year along with interest, the complainant lent another sum of Rs.20,00,000/- to the accused on 08.06.2008 through cheques bearing Nos.065793 and 065794 of State Bank of India.  In repayment of the said amount, the accused issued a cheque bearing No.273840 drawn on Syndicate Bank for a sum of Rs.46,74,000/- dated 17.5.2010 being the principal amount with upto date interest. The said cheque when presented for encashment was returned unpaid for \"funds insufficient\". The complainant issued a legal notice on 08.06.2010 and initiated action against the accused under section 138 of N.I. Act.  Before the trial court, the complainant examined himself as PW.1 and produced in evidence the original cheque Ex.P1, Bank Memo Ex.P2,Copy of legal notice Ex.P3, Postal acknowledgement Ex.P5, Cheque returned register extract Ex.P6 and Bank account extract Ex.P7. He also examined PW.2 Sri.G.Jairam. Feeling aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order, the complainant has preferred this appeal. I have heard learned counsel for appellant and learned counsel for respondent and perused the records.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 4. Considering the above evidence, learned Magistrate dismissed the complaint returning a finding that the complainant failed to prove the legal liability due by the accused as on the date of issuance of the cheque, for the reason that in his legal notice as well as in his evidence, the complainant asserted that the accused had borrowed the aforesaid amount from him undertaking to repay the same with interest at 18% per annum, if so, the total amount due to the complainant as on the date of the cheque would come to Rs.38,62,000/- and not Rs.46,74,000/- as reflected in the cheque. Thus concluding that there was no legally enforceable debt of Rs.46,74,000/- as on the date of presentation of the cheque, learned Magistrate by referring to Head Notes of various decisions, dismissed the complaint.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: 5. The contention of the learned counsel for the complainant is that the accused having admitted the receipt of Rs.28,00,000/- and also having put forth a plea of discharge, in the absence of any material to show the repayment of the cheque amount, by virtue of the presumption under Section 139 of N.I. Act, the Trial Court could not have dismissed the complaint in entirety.  Further, referring to para 12 of the impugned judgment, he submitted that the learned Magistrate having come to the conclusion that the accused owed Rs.38,62,000/-, as on the date of the dishonour of the cheque, ought to have presumed that the cheque was issued towards discharge of the aforesaid debt or liability. Placing reliance on the decision of this Court in S. Parameshwarappa and Another v/s S. Choodappa, 2007 CRI.L.J. 586, the learned counsel emphasized that once the cheque is issued, the accused cannot contend that it is not in respect of the legally enforceable debt, as the complainant had established in evidence, that the amount \"was due\" by the accused as on the date of issuance of the cheque.  In other words, it is the argument of the learned counsel, that the proceedings before the learned Magistrate was one for dishonour of the cheque and not for recovery of a debt before the Civil Court wherein the plaintiff is required to prove his claim based on evidence, whereas in an action under Section 138 of N.I. Act, on proof of issuance of the cheque, the onus shifts to the accused to rebut the presumption that the cheque was issued not for discharge of any debt or liability in terms of Section 138 of N.I. Act. Therefore, the learned Magistrate could not have dismissed the complaint solely on account of discrepancy in determination of the amount, based on the oral evidence of the parties, contrary to the tenor of the document.\n**Argument by Respondent**: . In rebuttal, the accused examined himself as DW.1. In his evidence, while admitting the receipt of Rs.8,00,000/- from the complainant, the accused took up a plea that on 06.12.2007, the complainant purchased a property and at that time, he refunded Rs.8,00,000/- and further paid another sum of Rs.10,00,000/- to the complainant. After few days, the complainant returned Rs.10,00,000/- and thus he was due only a sum of Rs.10,00,000/-.  He further contended that for recovery of the said amount, the complainant filed a civil suit. As the complainant promised to withdraw the said suit, the accused paid him another sum of Rs.5,00,000/- and thus, in his evidence, the accused took up a stand that he owed only a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- to the complainant. Further he deposed that during the above transaction, the complainant had taken eight blank cheques and eight blank stamp papers from him and the same have been used by the complainant to lay a false claim and thus sought to dismiss the complaint. In the course of cross-examination, the accused admitted receipt of Rs.28,00,000/- from the complainant on 22.10.2007 and 10.06.2008 by way of cheques.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 6. The learned advocate for the accused, however, argued in support of the impugned judgment, contending that the complainant having failed to establish that the amount of Rs.46,74,000/- shown in the dishonoured cheque was in fact due and payable to the complainant as on the date of presentation of the cheque, the trial court was justified in dismissing the complaint, as the accused could not have drawn the subject cheque towards discharge of the alleged liability. 7. I have considered these submissions in the light of the pleadings and the evidence adduced by the parties. 8. In appreciating the contentions urged by the accused, it is important to note that, in his evidence before the Court, the accused (DW.1) has unequivocally admitted receipt of Rs.8,00,000/- as loan from the complainant and has further stated that he had agreed to pay interest thereon at the rate of 3% per annum. Further he deposed that on 06.12.2007, the complainant had purchased a property and had approached him and at that time, he repaid Rs.8,00,000/- and further paid another sum of Rs.10,00,000/-, in all Rs.18,00,000/-, to the complainant. He has even gone to the extent of stating that the complainant added another Rs.10,00,000/-, which was with him, and paid Rs.28,00,000/- to his vendor and after few days, the complainant returned Rs.10,00,000/- received by him and therefore, he (accused) was due only Rs.10,00,000/- to the complainant.  He further asserted that the complainant filed a civil suit for recovery of the said amount, but on the promise of the complainant to withdraw the said suit, he (accused) repaid another sum of Rs.5,00,000/- and thus, he was due to pay only Rs.5,00,000/- to the complainant. Further he deposed that he had issued a reply to the legal notice issued by the complainant and further stated that he had \"given\" 8 blank cheques and 8 blank stamp papers to the complainant. 9. In the cross-examination, when a specific suggestion was made to the accused (DW.1) that a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- was credited to his account through cheque on 22.10.2007 and Rs.10,00,000/- each by way of two cheques on 10.06.2008 and Rs.3,00,000/- on 23.11.2007, the accused plainly answered that he had received only Rs.28,00,000/-. Thus, the accused ended up in admitting the receipt of Rs.28,00,000/-. 10. On going through the entire evidence on record, I find this is the only fact that has been proved by the complainant. Undeniably the cheque in question stands for Rs.46,74,000/-. The accused has not denied the issuance of the subject cheque.  Instead in the course of his evidence, he has taken a faint / vague plea that he had \"given\" 8 blank cheques and 8 blank stamp papers to the complainant. He has not elaborated on this aspect nor has he stated the circumstance under which he had \"given\" 8 blank cheques and 8 blank stamp papers to the complainant. 11. There is a presumption that until contrary is proved, every negotiable instrument duly executed, is for discharge of a debt or a liability. It is not the case of the accused that he either signed 8 cheques or parted with them under any threat or coercion nor is it the case of the accused that the cheques \"given\" by him were not towards the discharge of any debt or liability due or payable by him to the complainant. 3. In the light of this legal proposition and in the absence of any contra evidence by the accused that cheque in question was not voluntarily \"given\" by him to the complainant, it may be reasonably presumed that the cheque in question was issued by the accused towards discharge of the legally enforceable debt due by him. 14. In the backdrop of the above conclusion, it is significant to note that section 139 of the N.I. Act mandates that the Court shall presume the liability of the drawer of a cheque for the amount for which the cheque is drawn. Nevertheless, the presumption contemplated under section 139 of the N.I. Act is a rebuttable presumption which lays down that unless the contrary is proved, it has to be presumed that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in section 138 of N.I. Act, for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. 15. In the instant case, the complainant has been able to prove that only a sum of Rs.28,00,000/- was due to him as on the date of the presentation of the subject cheque for encashment. Though he has contended that the amount of Rs.46,74,000/- mentioned in Ex.P1 cheque included the interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the principal amount borrowed by the accused, but as discussed above, no material is produced by the complainant in proof of the claim of interest at the rate of 18% per annum. As a result, the amount reflected in the cheque cannot be reconciled to the actual amount due and payable by the accused.  17. Section 138 of the N.I. Act does not bar the conviction of the accused if the debt or liability due by him is found less than the amount reflected in the cheque as long as it is proved that the cheque in question was voluntarily issued in discharge of the whole or part of the debt.  The difference in the amount shown in the cheque and the actual amount due by the drawer as on the date of presentation of the cheque may be relevant factor to determine the fine or compensation for the loss caused to the complainant, but the said discrepancy cannot absolve the accused of the consequence of dishonour of the cheque. If such a position is accepted, it would defeat the object of Chapter XVII of the N.I. Act as the drawer of the cheque could conveniently avert the prosecution under Section 138 of the N.I. Act by making payment of a part or fraction of the cheque amount thereby bringing about discrepancy and incongruity in the amount shown in the cheque and the actual amount due as on the date of presentation of the cheque. Therefore, I am unable to accept the reasoning of the Trial Court that on account of the discrepancy in the amount reflected in the cheque and the actual amount due by the accused, the accused cannot be proceeded under section 138 of the N.I. Act. In that view of the matter, the impugned judgment, in my view, cannot be sustained. 8. However, insofar as the award of fine or compensation is concerned, the evidence adduced by the parties with regard to the alleged agreement between the parties to pay interest and the long lapse of time taken by the accused to repay the amount to the complainant may be a factor which requires to be considered in view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in M/s Meters and Instruments Private Limited vs. Kanchan Mehta, 2018(1) SCC 560 : (AIR 2017 SC 4594), wherein it is held:\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "1. The main issue of the case is whether the lower court correctly ruled that the bank should pay interest on an amount of Rs.9.85 lakhs from the date of the cheque's issue till the date of payment, despite the cheque being lost in transit. \n\n2. Critically assessing the lower court's judgment, we find that the bank did not deficiently service the respondent by asking him to obtain a duplicate cheque. The respondent failed to do so, indicating his knowledge that the drawer did not have sufficient funds for encashment. The State Commission erred in ignoring the stark reality and awarding interest.\n\n3. Therefore, we DISMISS the appeal and uphold the lower court's decision not to award interest to the respondent."

    "Case_Result": "The High Court noted that a sum of Rs.2,30,000/- was payable to the complainant-respondent No.1 herein by the present appellant -accused and since the payment was not made there was an agreement between the parties to stipulate the mode of payment. A sum of Rs.2,30,000/- was to be paid in 8 instalments and the first instalment was of a sum of Rs.50,000/- payable by 22.6.2002 and the 8th instalment of Rs.10,000/- was payable by 28.2.2003. As a security for the payment, the appellant issued three cheques. One of the cheques was of Rs.1 lakh and that is the subject matter of present controversy. Stand was taken that since the cheque was issued as a security, the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (in short the 'Act') had no application. The High Court noticed that the appellant failed to pay Rs.2,30,000/- in instalments as agreed to and therefore because of default of payment cheque of Rupees one lakh was presented.

Mr. Anand would submit that it was obligatory on the part of the advocate who is an agent of his client to appear on the dates of hearing, more so when an accused had been appearing in person and remained present in court for all the days of hearing.  In any event, it was urged, the High Court committed a serious error in disposing of the appeal only upon hearing a legal aid counsel and even the submissions made by him had not been noticed.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Mr. A.

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: We may, at the outset, notice that before passing the impugned order, the High Court did not choose to serve notice upon the appellant opining that no useful purpose would be served in keeping the appeal pending and one G. Vinodkumar was appointed as a legal aid counsel. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant is before us. Section 256 of the Code provides for disposal of a complaint in default. It entails in acquittal. But, the question which arises for consideration is as to whether the said provision could have been resorted to in the facts of the case as the witnesses on behalf of complainant have already been examined. The date was fixed for examining the defence witnesses. Appellant could have examined witnesses, if he wanted to do the same. In that case, the appearance of the complainant was not necessary. It was for her to cross-examine the witnesses examined on behalf of the defence.  The accused was entitled to file an application under Section 311 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Such an application was required to be considered and disposed of by the learned Magistrate. We have noticed hereinbefore that the complainant did not examine herself as a witness.  She was sought to be summoned again for cross-examination. The said prayer has not yet been allowed. But, that would not mean that on that ground the court would exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Section 256 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 at that stage or the defence would not examine his witnesses. Presence of the complainant or her lawyer would have been necessary, as indicated hereinbefore, only for the purpose of cross- examination of the witnesses examined on behalf of the defence. If she did not intend to do so, she would do so at her peril but it cannot be said that her presence was absolutely necessary.  Furthermore, when the prosecution has closed its case and the accused has been examined under Section 311 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the court was required to pass a judgment on merit of the matter. We are not concerned herein as to whether the constituted attorney of the complainant could represent the complainant. Similar contention of the complainant that the advocate is an agent of his client and it is his duty to appear on behalf of his client, in our opinion, is beyond the scope of this appeal.\n",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e994e\n**Facts**: Rule. Returnable forthwith. Heard finally by consent of parties.\\n\\n2. The petitioner herein seeks to challenge the order passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Murtizapur, in Summary Criminal Case No.585/04, dated 11-7-2007, by which he dismissed the application of the petitioner for dropping the proceedings against him, in complaint case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, filed by the respondent. Facts leading to the petition, can be stated in nutshell; thus : The respondent/complainant has filed a criminal complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, bearing Summary Criminal Case No.585/2004 in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Murtizapur. When the proceedings were fixed for filing the affidavit in the nature of evidence, the petitioner filed an application for dropping the proceedings against him under section 258 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The prayer therein reads thus : \"It is, therefore, prayed that the Hon'ble Court may kindly be pleased to allow this application in the interest of justice and equity. Till then the further recording of the evidence may kindly be deferred till the decision on this application.\" The reasons for which this application was filed, according to the petitioner/accused, were that the complaint does not make out a criminal offence under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881; the complainant is misusing the relevant provision; the notice issued to the accused/petitioner was not proper; the complaint was barred by limitation; if the proceedings are not dropped, it would be causing serious hardship and injustice to the petitioner/accused. With these main contentions, the petitioner claimed stopping of the proceedings as per above prayer.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: . Learned J.M.F.C. Murtizapur, heard the parties. So also considered the say of the complainant/respondent. He found that in view of the judgment of the Apex Court in Adalat Prasad Vs. Rooplal Jinda, reported in 2004(4) Mh.L.J. 274 : [2004 ALL MR (Cri) 3131 (S.C.)], the process cannot be recalled.  He further found that in summary proceedings, there is no provision at all to drop the proceedings after the stage of recording of evidence is commenced and therefore, the application which is moved by the petitioner/ accused is not tenable in the eye of law. As such, he dismissed the application of the petitioner/accused by his order dated 11-7-2007.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the complainant/respondent has failed to make out a case under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against the petitioner/accused. According to him, considering the totality of the circumstances and facts pleaded in the complaint, there cannot be any case for trial against the petitioner/accused.  He further submitted that the respondent/ complainant has mentioned false facts. Further, according to him, the complaint is barred by limitation. The cheque issued by the petitioner was not for legal liability or for satisfaction of any debt. The complaint, even if taken as a whole, would not make out any offence against the petitioner. He further claimed that the offence under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 cannot be treated at par with an offence under Indian Penal Code, 1860. Therefore, according to him, if the proceedings in a complaint filed by the respondent are allowed to be continued, serious prejudice and injustice would be caused to the petitioner/accused. Therefore, he submitted that the proceedings against the petitioner/accused should be dropped/stopped by setting aside the order passed by the learned J.M.F.C, Murtizapur. It is also his submission that the present respondent has filed summary criminal case (presumably civil suit) before the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Akola, for recovery of the amount and the pleadings in the said suit are entirely different than the facts stated in the notice dated 16-5-2004. Therefore, according to him, the proceedings against the petitioner are based on incorrect facts and therefore, they are liable to be dropped.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  As against this, learned counsel for respondent No.1 while raising preliminary objection as regards maintainability, contended that as the proceedings filed by the complainant are not filed by the police authorities, the provisions of section 258 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 are not applicable. Further, according to him, there is no provision under the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to discharge the accused in the midway of the trial. According to him, the complainant had filed his affidavit in examination-in-chief and thereafter the petitioner/accused is prolonging the matter. Mainly his contention is that as the provisions of section 258 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 are not applicable to the present proceedings, the same cannot be dropped or stopped. On merits he has submitted that the offence under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 has been made out considering the presumption under section 139 of the said Act.  He, therefore, submitted that the writ petition filed by the petitioner is devoid of any merit and therefore, it is liable to be dismissed.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: By this petition under Article 227 of the Constitution Of India, 1950, as well as under section 482 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the petitioner seeks to challenge that order. . Few facts before considering the contentions of the rival parties need to be noted. The complaint filed by the respondent is under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 read with section 420 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. The process has been issued. The petitioner/accused has appeared. He has not challenged the order of issue of process. The stage of the proceedings was the filing of the affidavit by the complainant in examination-in-chief, which he had filed  The application of the petitioner himself states that the present case is fixed for evidence of the complainant. The complainant has filed the affidavit in examination-in-chief on record and exhibited the documents which are referred to in the affidavit. Thus, it clearly appears that the trial against the petitioner has already proceeded. in support of his contentions. The appellant questioned the aforesaid view of the learned single Judge on the strength of section 258 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It must be pointed out that the offence under section 500 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 is triable as a summons case in accordance with the provisions contained in Chapter XX of the Code. Sections 251 to 257 of that chapter deal with the steps to be adopted from the commencement up to culmination of the proceedings in summons case.  One of the normal rules in summons cases is that once trial started, it should reach its normal culmination. Summons cases are generally of two categories. Those instituted upon complaints and those instituted otherwise than upon complaints. The latter category would include cases based on police reports. Section 258 of the Code is intended to cover those cases belonging to one category along i.e. summons cases instituted otherwise than upon complaints.\" The segment separated at the last part of the section by the words \"and in any other case\" is only a subcategory or division consisting of \"summons cases instituted otherwise than upon complaints\". That sub-category is not intended to cover all summons cases other than those instituted on police report. In fact. section 258 vivisects only \"summons cases instituted otherwise than on complaints\" into two divisions. One division consists of cases in which no evidence of material witnesses was recorded. The section permits the Court to acquit the accused prematurely only in those summons cases otherwise than on complaints wherein the evidence of material witnesses was recorded. But the power of Court to discharge an accused at midway stage is restricted to those cases instituted otherwise than on complaints wherein no material witness was examined at all. The upshot of the above is that section 258 of the Code has no application to cases instituted upon complaints. The present is a case which was instituted on complaint. Hence the endeavour made by the accused to find help from section 258 of the Code is of no avail.\" At this stage, it is necessary to see the provisions of section 258 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The same are also extracted in John's case. The provisions of section 258 clearly enjoins that in any summon cases instituted \"otherwise than upon a complaint\", a Magistrate of First Class may for reasons to be recorded stop the proceedings. It is obvious that in the present case, the proceedings are instituted by the respondent i.e. complainant.   Here is the case where the evidence of the parties has begun and the order of issue of process was not challenged by the ' petitioner/accused at the proper stage. Hence, the trial needs to be culminated and taken to its logical end.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue in this case is whether the lower court was correct in dismissing the private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 due to non-appearance of the complainant. The petitioner contends that the order passed by the trial court amounts to misuse of the process of law and is against the interest of justice, as the complainant did not appear on the earlier dates and the matter was called twice.\n\nUpon analysis, the lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 due to non-appearance of the complainant, seems to be based on the procedural provision of Section 246 or 249 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. While the non-appearance of the complainant may be a valid reason for dismissal of a complaint, the question arises whether this should be the case under Section 138 of the Negotiable InstrUMENTS Act, 1881.\n\nSection 138 of the Negotiable InSTRUMENTS Act, 1881 specifically requires the issuer of a cheque to make payment of the amount of the cheque to the payee within 15 days of the presentation. If the cheque is not honored due to insufficient funds in the account of the maker, the issuer is deemed to have committed an offence. The provision does not explicitly mention any time limit for filing a complaint under Section 138.\n\nIn the present case, the non-appearance of the complainant might be due to procedural issues or other reasons. Dismissing the complaint due to non-appearance of the complainant without considering the merits of the case under Section 138 of the Negotiable InSTRUMENTS Act, 1881 may not be in accordance with the law.\n\nHence, the appeal should be allowed, and the order passed by the lower court dismissing the private complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable InSTRUMENTS Act, 1881 should be set aside. The complainant should be given an opportunity to file and prove the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable InSTRUMENTS Act, 1881 on merits."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe applicant is the complainant who filed a complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  On 27th October 2002, the case was adjourned to 16th November 2002. On 16th November 2002, the complainant/applicant and his advocate were absent. A fresh plea was recorded on that day and the case was fixed for recording of evidence on 28th November 2002.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe learned counsel for the applicant has invited my attention to the Roznama of the proceedings of the case as well as the averments made in paragraph 2 of the application.\\n\\nHis submission is that on 16th November 2002, the applicant could not reach the court of the Magistrate before the matter was called out. The learned Magistrate recorded the plea of the accused. It is pointed out that when the applicant enquired with the Sheristedar, he was informed that the case was adjourned to 4th January 2003. He was not aware that the case was fixed for recording of evidence on 28th November 2002. He submitted that there is sufficient explanation for absence of the applicant on the day on which the complaint was dismissed. The learned counsel for the respondents no.1 to 4 (accused) submitted that there is no explanation for the absence of the applicant and the Advocate for the applicant.\\n\\nHe submitted that the complaint was filed in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate at Mulund. He pointed out that both the applicant and his advocate are resident of Mulund and the accused attended the court at Mulund by all the way coming from Vile Parle. He submitted that a fresh plea of the accused was recorded on 16th November 2002. Though the case was fixed for recording of evidence on 28th November 2002, the applicant had chosen to remain absent. He submitted that no case is made out for interference. 5. In paragraph 2 of the application for leave, the applicant has stated thus :\\n\\n\"2. The Applicant/Appellant further states that almost on all the dates the Applicant/Appellant was remaining present in Court. However, on 16-11-2002 he reached the Court late by a few minutes and the mattes was however called out by then plea of the accused was recorded and was adjourned to 28-11-2002. On enquiry with the Sheristedar the complainant was however informed that the matter was adjourned to 4-1-2003. The complainant informed his Advocate accordingly. The complainant and his Advocate were therefore not present in Court on 28-11-2002 as they were under impression that the complaint was adjourned to 4-1-2003. The complaint was called out and was dismissed to default and accused were acquitted on 28-11-2002. The complainant's brother Shri Tilak Dedhia who happened to be in Court on that day for his case being C.C.No.160/S/1997, appeared when the above case was called out and prayed for an adjournment as the complainant was not present at that time under the impression that the case stood adjourned to 4-1-2003. The Ld. Magistrate however passed an order dismissed the complaint and acquitted the Accused. The complaint was thus dismissed for default as under the bonafide mistake the complainant could not remained present when the matter was called out. The Appellant states that on the very next day i.e. on 29-11-2002 he made an application before the said Magistrate for restoration of the said complaint and setting aside the order of dismissal dated 28-11-2002 but the same was rejected on the ground that there is no provision for restoration of complaint in the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\"\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe learned counsel for the respondent nos.1 to 4 stated that if the complaint of the year 1998 is to be restored, the said respondents will suffer serious prejudice as they will have to attend the court at Mulund by coming all the way from Vile Parle. The prejudice which may be caused to the respondent nos.2 to 4 can be taken care of by directing the learned Magistrate to consider the application for exemption favourably if made by the said respondents.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nBy order dated 11th February 2009, this court directed that these applications and appeals will be heard and disposed of finally. The complaint has been dismissed by order dated 28th November 2002 by the learned Magistrate in exercise of power under section 256 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The order was passed by recording that though the complaint was fixed for recording of evidence, the applicant/complainant was absent and even his Advocate was absent.\n",
    "Case_Result": "2. Accordingly, I have taken up the matters for final hearing. The facts of both these applications are more or less identical. Therefore, I am referring to the facts of the case in Criminal Application no.627 of 20034. I have carefully considered the submissions. I have perused the Roznama of the proceedings. The complaint was filed in March 1998. Perusal of the extract of Roznama produced before this court shows that there does not appear to be any default on the part of the applicant in attending to the proceedings. Roznama shows that from time to time the applicant along with his Advocate was present. On 22nd October 2002, it appears that some of the accused persons were not present and therefore warrant was issued and the next date fixed was 27th October 2002. On 27th October 2003 warrant was cancelled. On both these dates, the complainant was present.6. Perusal of the Roznama shows that from the year 1998 onward, the applicant was diligently prosecuting the complaint. The applicant was admittedly absent on 16th November 2002. The reason for absence on 28th November 2002 has been mentioned in paragraph 2 of the application which is quoted above. This is not a case where the applicant was negligent. The case remained pending from the year 1998 to 2002. When the applicant remained absent on two dates in the year 2002, the learned Judge has taken a very harsh view of the matter. Apart from this there is sufficient explanation for his absence which is set out in paragraph 2 of the application. The decision of this court in case of Sonam Company Pvt.Ltd. will have no application as in the said case there was no explanation for the absence of the applicant/complainant. In my view, an opportunity deserves to be granted to the applicant to prosecute the complaint. Application disposed of",

Fulzele, A.P.P. for respondent no.1 and Shri. Z. A. Haq, Advocate for respondent no.2.\\n\\n2. This is an application under section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code. The applicant is an accused in a complaint case filed by the respondent no.2 for the offences under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The said complaint is filed on 10.9.2003 and it is pending before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Patur. It is alleged that the relevant cheque was issued for the due amount towards the purchase of goods. The defence of the applicant - accused was of denial of liability.  His statement under section 313 was recorded He wanted to adduce evidence in rebuttal and in support of his contentions as regards his no liability towards respondent -complainant. It is necessary to mention that the petitioner/accused had submitted his affidavit in the nature of his evidence as per Ex.137. According to him, at that time some documents were available, so they were filed. But some of them were not available at the relevant time.  The matter was posted on 11.4.2007 for the cross-examination of the applicant. It is alleged that in the meantime the applicant - accused received some more documents and he wanted to produce the same. Accordingly, he filed an application Exh.157. Along with application he filed some 9 documents as per list Exh.158. According to the applicant - accused, these documents are relevant. The documents at serial no. I and 2 are the counter foils of the cheque numbers 0301732 and 0301733.  he other documents which were sought to be filed were acknowledgment, postal receipts and certified copy of some cases i.e. SCC no.84/2006, SCC no. 131/2007, SCC no.75/2006, SCC no.793/06, SCC no 212/2004. It was the case of the applicant - accused that these documents are relevant to prove his defence. This order dated 26.4.2007 is challenged in this application. As such, learned counsel submitted that the impugned order of the learned Magistrate should be set aside and the applicant accused should be allowed to lead his evidence on the documents which he had produced.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 4. Learned Magistrate after hearing the parties, found that though applicant accused had examined himself as witness, his attempt to produce these documents in the nature of evidence is not permissible. He is trying to fill in the lacuna. According to him, the allegation that the respondent - complainant was a money lender, at that time would cause prejudice to the complainant. After considering the merits of the issue, he found that the request of accepting these documents i.e. which are filed along with application Exh.158 is liable to be rejected. So also, Exh. 159 an application for allowing the applicant - accused to lead additional affidavit in examination in chief Exh. 161. As such these applications of applicant were rejected.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Learned counsel for the applicant - accused . Shri. Mohta has contended that the applicant - accused was entitled to move this application in support of his defence. It is further his contention that the applicant - accused wanted to prove that the respondent -complainant was doing money lending business and therefore, these documents were necessary and so production of the same should have been allowed, so also an application to allow further evidence by the learned Magistrate.  According to him, Rules of procedure are instruments to lead towards justice. Technicality should not over come the steps of justice and justice oriented approach should have been adopted by the learned Magistrate. In short, he has submitted that though the application was belated as it was in order to allow the applicant - accused to prove his defence, the approach of the learned Magistrate should have been to allow the production of those documents and further evidence by the applicant - accused.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Per contra Shri. Haq, learned counsel for the respondent - complainant has submitted that this is the third round of litigation. As regards the conduct of the applicant -accused, this court has observed that the move taken by applicant is vexatious and obviously for causing delay in the trial vide observations in Criminal Application No.1281/2006 by this court.  Therefore, according to him, this practice of the applicant - accused to prolong the matter some way or the other should be curbed. Further according to him documents no.5 to 9 in the said list are not the complaints of the persons who had allegedly obtained loans from the respondent - complainant.  They are the certified copies of the complaints filed by he himself. According to him, the respondent no.2 (complainant) is doing the business of selling pesticides. Further according to him the cross-examination of the applicant - accused has been completed in August, 2007. This application is filed some time in October, 2007 i.e. after considerable delay. The intention is obvious and apparent, just to prolong the matter. On merits he supported the order of the learned trial Judge.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

On close perusal of those xerox copies of the certified copies, it would be seen that they are not related to the complaints made by the loan borrowers of respondent no.2 regarding money lending transactions allegedly done by him. In these circumstances, the contention of the applicant -accused in this behalf needs to be rejected.  As regards the documents at serial no.1 and 2 as they are stated to be counter foils of the relevant cheques, there is no difficulty in allowing the production of the same with necessary permission to him for leading evidence, if necessary.  As regards the documents no.3 and 4 which are acknowledgment and postal receipts, no specific contentions has been raised by the applicant -accused. Taking over all view of the matter and considering the fact that the applicant -accused has to make out his case raised in defence, though there would be some delay in disposal of the case and applicant - accused is prolonging the matter, as observed by this court, on that count alone, the application of the applicant - accused cannot be rejected. No order can be passed by any judicial authority with any prejudice in mind.  May be the applicant/accused has been observed to have been prolonging the litigation by vexatious applications. In my opinion that fact by itself would not be sufficient to reject the present application of the applicant - accused, as it is necessary to be allowed in the interest of justice and for furthering his defence.\n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe present applicant is the original accused in S.T.C.No. 60/05 which is tried by the Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Navapur for the offence punishable under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. 4. The present respondent filed a private complaint in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Navapur, alleging that the accused had purchased the live chicken stock from the complainant of worth Rs. 3 lakhs. Towards the payment of said amount the accused had issued one cheque bearing No. 194321 to the complainant for the amount of Rs. 3 lakhs. The said cheque dated 22nd November, 2004 was drawn on the State Bank of India, Branch at Songad. . On 25.3.2008 the present applicant filed Criminal Appeal No. 2/2008 before the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Nandurbar, challenging the judgment and order dated 29.02.2008 passed by the J.M.F.C., Navapur 7. In the said appeal the appellant/present applicant has filed application Exh. 4 for suspension of sentence and for releasing the appellant on bail, pending the hearing and final disposal of the criminal appeal.   The present application is filed by the applicant under section 482 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, challenging the said order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Nandurbar below Exh. 4 in Criminal Appeal No. 2/2008 to the extent of direction to deposit 50% of the amount of compensation.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n9. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submits that the impugned judgment and order is contrary to the facts on record of this case to the extent of direction in respect of payment of amount of compensation. He further submits that this Court in case of Mohamad Hafiz Khan Vs. Anand Finance & Anr. reported in 2003 ALL M.R. (Cri.) 1937 has been pleased to suspend the sentence on deposit of amount equivalent to 1/4th of the compensation awarded. He further submits that in other Criminal Applications Nos. 119/2006, 120/2006 and 121/2006 this Court allowed the application filed by the original accused and the order of stay to the effect, operation and execution of the judgment and order passed by the learned J.M.F.C., directing to deposit 1/4 of the compensation amount. The sum and substance of the argument of the counsel for applicant is that the interim order passed by this Court, directing the present applicant to deposit 1/4 amount of compensation should be made absolute.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n10. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent vehemently opposed the prayer of the applicant and submitted that Sessions Court, taking facts and circumstances of this case in to account, has rightly directed the applicant to deposit 50% amount, therefore, no interference is called for and prayed that this Court may not be interfered in the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge. The learned counsel relied on the judgment of this Court in the case of Maheshwar Dattatraya Kale Vs. Capt. Atul Wasudeo Divekar & Anr. reported in 2006 (1) A.I.R. Bom. R 361 and submitted that the learned judge would have been justified in imposing condition of deposit of the entire compensation amount. He further submitted that the Additional Sessions Judge has taken a reasonable view and directed the present applicant to deposit 50% amount. He further submitted that in view of the order passed by the Sessions Court, taking reasonable view, this application may be rejected.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n2. This application is filed, challenging the judgment and order dated 21st June, 2008 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Nandurbar below application, Exh. 4, in Criminal Appeal No. 2/2008.  On 29.2.2008 the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Navapur has been pleased to convict the accused for the offence punishable under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and has sentenced the accused to suffer simple imprisonment for six months and to pay the compensation of Rs. 3 lakhs to the original complainant. On 21st June, 2008 the Additional Sessions Judge, Nandurbar has been pleased to allow the application, Exh. 4, partly and has granted the stay to the operation of the judgment and order dated 29.2.2008 passed by the J.M.F.C., Navapur on the condition of depositing 50 % amount by the appellant/ present applicant.\n",
    "Case_Result": "11. Heard the learned counsel for the applicant and respondent at great length. Mere perusal of the application and ground No. 4 taken in the application would show that the applicant is resident of small town namely Songad. There are large number of members in his family who are dependant on his income. The applicant belongs to poor strata of the society. The applicant is running a small business in retail.12. This Court by order dated 30 July, 2008, directed the applicant to deposit 25% amount in stead of 50% as directed by the Sessions Court.It is true thatnormally the Court should direct to deposit entire amount of compensation. However, such direction is necessarily depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. This Court taking a reasonable view passed interim order on 30th July, 2008, directing the applicant to deposit 25% amount in stead of 50% amount as directed by the Sessions Court. It is not in dispute that in pursuance to interim order of this Court, the present applicant has deposited the amount. In my view, the ends of justice would be met if the lower appellate Court is directed to decide the appeal filed by the applicant expeditiously and till then effect and operation of judgment and order dated 29th February, 2008 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Navapur is stayed. Application disposed of",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9b67\n**Facts**: This appeal is filed by the appellant- complainant against the judgment and order dated 09.02.2010 on the file of the Additional Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) and JMFC, Hospet in C.C. No.1394/2008, acquitting the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Brief facts of the case are as under : The accused was prosecuted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act based on a private complaint filed by the appellant- complainant. It was registered in C.C. No.1394/2008 on the file of the Additional Civil Judge (Jr.Dn) and JMFC, Hospet. The facts are that, the respondent-accused has issued one cheque bearing No.292652 dated 07.03.2008 to the appellant-complainant drawn on State Bank of India, for Rs.1,20,000/- towards the discharge of his liability in view of the promissory note executed by him on 07.03.2008 in favour of the appellant for Rs.1,20,000/-.  The said cheque after presentation to the bank for payment was dishonored on 07.03.2008. It returned with an endorsement as \"Funds Insufficient\". Therefore, the complainant got issued legal notice on 10.03.2008 to the respondent-accused calling upon him to pay the amount due in cheque. Despite the receipt of the said notice, respondent did not comply the same. Therefore, the complainant presented a complaint under Section 200 of Cr.P.C. 1973 alleging the offence punishable under Section 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instrument Act, 1981. After filing the complaint, the trial Court took cognizance of the offence alleged. Sworn statement of complainant was recorded. On the basis of the evidence, prima-facie case was found for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act.  The trial Court issued process to the accused. After appearance, plea of the accused was recorded. The accused pleaded not guilty. The matter was proceeded for trial. After holding the trial, the learned Magistrate acquitted the accused of the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act. The complainant, being aggrieved by the said judgment and order dated 09.02.2010, has preferred this appeal on the following grounds after obtaining special leave.\\n\\n1. The order of acquittal by the trial court is illegal, invalid, erroneous and contrary to law and evidence on record.\\n\\n2. The Court below has committed serious error in acquitting the respondent when the appellant had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt by adducing cogent and reliable evidence.\\n\\n3. The Court below has not at all applied its mind to the provisions of Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments, Act before passing the impugned order.\\n\\n4. The learned Magistrate has committed serious error in not considering the evidence of P.W.1 and material produced which clearly proves the commission of offence committed by the respondent.\\n\\n5. The learned Magistrate has lost sight of the fact that the appellant has satisfied all the ingredients of Section - 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. The Court below ought to have come to conclusion that the appellant/ complainant has complied the mandatory provisions contained in Sections 139 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act in view of the decisions cited by the Complainant reported in 2008 (4) Karnataka Law Journal at Page No.279, therefore, the Judgment of the trial court, which is contra to the principles laid down in the said decision by this Hon'ble Cour  Therefore, the judgment is prima facie unsustainable under law and the same is liable to be set aside. The trial Court has erroneously shifted the burden of proof on the appellant without raising a presumption as provided under Section 139 of Negotiable Instrument, Act.\\n\\n9. The Court below without considering the ingredients of Section 139 of Negotiable Instrument Act, and Section 118 of the Evidence Act, has acquitted the respondent/accused. Held, the order of the trial court was illegal, incorrect and same was set aside by this Hon'ble Court in a judgment reported in 2007 (4) KCCR -2448.  The appellant has examined himself before the trial court and deposed to the effect that, the respondent issued the cheque Ex.P1 towards legally recoverable debt as per Section - 118 and 139 of N.I. Act. The presumption is to be drawn in favour of the appellant that the respondent issued a cheque towards repayment of any legally recoverable debt or other liability and it is for the respondent to rebut the said presumption. But, in the instant case the respondent has failed to lead any evidence in respect of the loan transaction in as much as the promissory note was executed by him on 07.03.2008 for Rs.1,20,000/- and for the said due, cheque was issued.  The defence taken by the respondent and his wife, who was examined as DW2 as she is a teacher and she has availed loan from the BDCC bank for Rs.1,50,000/- out of the said loan, she has paid the amount through a cheque on 09.05.2007 Rs.50,000/- and on 08.06.2007 Rs.30,000/- and on 03.11.2007 Rs.20,000/- to the accused, in all, the wife of the respondent has paid Rs.1,00,000/- after filing the complaint the respondent paid Rs.20,000/- to the complainant on 29.08.2008. In view of the said position, there is no recoverable debt by the respondent. The defence taken by the respondent that there is no legally recoverable debt under the cheque Ex.P1 cannot be believed unless the same is corroborated with evidence, mere denial of the case of the appellant through irrelevant documents, will not constitute rebuttal of the evidence of the appellant, the respondent has failed to prove before the court that, as on the date of the dishonour of the cheque in question, he had sufficient amount in his account and that the cheque has been dishonoured for the reason other than want of sufficient funds. Thus, it cannot be held that, the respondent has successfully rebutted the presumption available in favour of the appellant under the act, as held by this Hon'ble court in a judgment reported in ILR 2008, KAR-4361. The trial court ought to have noticed that there was a transaction between the complainant and the accused, the accused had issued cheque and the cheque so issued in the instant case on being presented since was bounced and since the accused did not make payment despite issue of statutory notice, the trial court ought to have held him guilty of an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.  Trial court ought to have held that the cheque issued was towards the discharge of liability, further the court below ought to have noticed that the signed cheque would not have been delivered by the respondent without there being any liability. The court below has committed serious error in acquitting the respondent, though the respondent has not disputed the issuance of cheque, admitted his signature on the cheque itself clearly proves that the ingredients of offence as punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. Therefore, the respondent is liable to be convicted for the offence punishable under the said provision. Court below without considering the ingredients of Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, and Section 118 of the Evidence Act, had acquitted the respondent /accused. Held, the order of the trial court was illegal, incorrect and same was set aside by this Hon'ble court in a judgment reported in 2007(4) KCCR 2448. The observation of the trial court that, on perusal of the Ex.P1 which is the cheque, clearly goes to show that the date is not written with ink, through seal date has been mentioned and also there is difference of the ink with regard to name of complainant and amount written in words on the Ex.P1, which wholly erroneous, unnecessary and contrary to the pleading and evidence on record. it is relevant to submit that, the respondent has himself admitted the cheque and his signature on the said cheque and other writings, moreover for the legal notice vide Ex.P3 issued by the appellant, the respondent has not replied, which clearly goes to show that there is presumption as per sections 118 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.  The impugned judgment and order is unsustainable in the eye of law and same is liable to be set aside. The order of the acquittal of the court below on wrong presumption is illegal, suffers from legal infirmity and the same is liable to be set aside. 6. Therefore, the learned counsel for the appellant-complainant prayed to allow the appeal and convict the respondent-accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The trial Court, though it has come to the conclusion that the appellant has proved the issuance of the cheque, bouncing of the cheque, ought to have come to conclusion that the respondent has committed offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act The learned Magistrate grossly erred in coming to the conclusion that the cheque was not issued towards legally recoverable debt. The Section 139 of Negotiable Instrument Act clearly states as follows: \"it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque, of the nature referred to in Section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. The respondent herein has failed to establish why the cheque was issued in favour of appellant.\" .\n**Argument by Petitioner**: In reply the learned counsel for the appellant-complainant submitted that the amount given by the wife of accused is related to loan taken by her from the complainant not for the present loan. The wife of the accused had repaid the amount, was a different transaction. Hence, defence of the accused should not be believed.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  The counsel for the respondent contended that the appellant-complainant has to prove his case. There was no transaction between the complainant and the wife of the accused. The wife of the accused after obtaining loan from the bank, had paid an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- and remaining amount of Rs.20,000/- was paid to the complainant in the court. Therefore, the acquittal of the trial Court is justifiable in law, facts and evidence on record. Hence, the learned counsel for the respondent-accused prayed to dismiss the appeal filed by the appellant- complainant.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: . Heard both the sides.\\n\\n8. The appellant reiterated the grounds stated above in the appeal during the arguments and by relying upon the judgment of Hon'ble Appex Court, the learned counsel strenuously contended to allow the appeal and prayed to convict the accused-respondent.  I answer the points as under : Point No.1: In the Negative Point No.2: In the Affirmative. When the respondent has not objected or insisted the Court to make a note of his objection and to mark the document, he cannot raise or canvass before the trial Court or this Court that the Courts have no right to consider the contents of the document in the judgment. Therefore, the question of remanding the matter for fresh disposal does not arise. of course, the application filed by the respondent before the trial Court has not been disposed of but the trial Court in its judgment has observed that the appellant has not filed any objection to I.A. No.I filed. Infact, the order sheet discloses that the statement of objection has been filed on 28.5.2004 before the disposal of the case. The respondent herein filed the I.A. after recording the evidence of parties i.e., at a belated stage. The appellant herein filed a detailed objection. In fact, the objection filed by the appellant discloses that the complaint filed for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. Therefore, when once the documents are admitted in evidence, without the objections of the opposite party when once the Court rightly or wrongly admits the documents, the admissibility of these documents cannot be questioned. Therefore, it could be said that the respondent fails to place proper rebuttal evidence to hold that the cheques issued by him was not for legally enforceable debt or otherwise. When the respondent admits about the issuance of the two cheques and the receipt of the demand notice and dishonouor of the cheques, he cannot now contend any say that it is not for legally enforceable debt. During the course of cross- examination PW.1 I.e., appellant- complainant admitted about the receipt of Rs.5,00,000/- during the pendency of the criminal case. The trial Court without considering the ingredients of Section 139 of the N.I. Act and Section 118 of the Evidence Act acquitted the respondent which is illegal, incorrect, perverse and liable to be set aside. I have gone through the authorities relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant- complainant. At the very outset, I opine that the above said authorities are relied to understand the principle of law governing the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act and the presumption applicable under Section 139 of N.I. Act can be relied. It is well settled principles of law that before applying any precedent to a criminal case, facts and circumstances should be very much similar. In the above said authorities, it is clear that the accused can rebut the presumption, it may be different from each case in the given circumstances. The explanation should be more possible explanation by way of rebuttal evidence. In other words, defence raised by the accused must be probable and capable of being accepted by the Court. In the first authority relied on by the appellant's advocate, the facts of the said case are totally different from the present case. In the said case, defence raised by the accused was, blank cheque was lost by him, which was made use of by the complainant. That itself was not established in the said case. . Second authority, in the said case, the defence of the accused being inconsistence and not probable was rightly not accepted by the Court. The Courts below upon appreciation of evidence have pointed out the inconsistency and improbable nature of the case of the accused. . Therefore, the appellant cannot rely on the above said authority. Next authority, the case was based on a agreement sale. The money was paid on the date of agreement and part payment was made through cheque which ultimately bounced. The Trial court rejected the case of the complainant on the ground that neither the agreement of sale dated 6.7.2002 nor the cancellation deed dated 2.12.2002 were not properly stamped which are inadmissible in evidence.  I proceed to discuss the evidence of this case so as to find out whether the defence raised by the accused is, probable and acceptable, because, in this case the cheque is not disputed. When the cheque was issued on 07.03.2008 for Rs.1,20,000/- towards discharge of dues of the complainant, then the money must have been advanced either of that date or previous to that date. On the very day, the said cheque is presented for encashment. The amount claimed is Rs.1,20,000/-. In the cross examination of PW1, it is admitted that on 16.01.2009 he has received a sum of Rs.20,000/- from the accused in the court itself. He did not produce promissory note said to have executed by the accused in his examination in chief. It got marked. In the cross examination of DW1, it is denied that the wife of the accused had taken any loan from the appellant-complainant but, she has issued cheques on various dates i.e., on 09.05.2007 for Rs.50,000/-, on 08.06.2007 for Rs.30,000/- and on 03.11.2007 for Rs.20,000/- amounting to Rs.1,00,000/- through her S.B. Account No.13112/105 of B.D.C.C. Bank Ltd., Hospet in order to discharge her husband's dues to the complainant. There was no reasons of the complainant to receive an amount of Rs.20,000/-. He admitted that there was difference of writing the word as \"Ganesh\" and amount written in the words as per Ex.P1, cheque and also difference of ink used for writing the same. Though he claims that the cheque was issued on 07.03.2008. In fact, it is not written in the place, where date is to be written. The rubber stamp date is found as \"E7 MAR 2008\". This appears in the rubber seal of the banck which put the seal receiving the seal It was specifically suggested that after receiving the amount from the accused, he has put up the date in the documents. According to him, the cheque as well as promissory note was executed on the same day. In the cross examination of the accused, who himself got examined as DW1, has admitted that he has written the amount in words and in figures on the cheque i.e., Ex.P5 and it had executed and signed promissory note at Ex.P5, signature is also admitted, writing of amount in words is admitted. He specifically stated that he has discharged the loan by way of cheque issued by his wife. To discharge the loan his wife took loan from B.D.C.C. Bank and issued the same. Even after receiving all the amount, the complainant did not return the cheque or promissory note, since the amount payable to the complainant has been paid. Therefore, he claims that he is not liable to pay any amount to the complainant.  In the cross-examination, it is suggested DW1 that amount is paid by his wife pertains to the loan taken by her and not to the loan pertains to the accused. Whereas, in the cross examination of PW1 it is admitted that he has no transaction with the wife of the accused, who is examined as DW2, she has produced the Account pass book at Ex.D1 and D2. Admittedly, she is working woman, she took loan from BDCC bank on the basis of her salary.  The said loan taken to discharge the loan of the complainant and for house repairs. On account of faith on the complainant, they have not taken signature on the counter. Except denying for sum of Rs.50,000/- and Rs.30,000/- cheque, complainant himself admits that he had received cheque of Rs.20,000/- from the wife of the accused. It was suggested DW2 that she has taken money as loan from the complainant separately. Therefore, she had given him cheque for Rs.20,000/-, but she denies the same. The accused has also examined DW3 the Bank Manager who certifies that the wife of the accused DW2 has received three cheques in favour of Ganesh. One cheque for Rs.50,000 issued on 09.05.2007 and another cheque for Rs.30,000/- issued on 08.06.2007 and lastly on 03.11.2007 a cheque for Rs.20,000/- were issued. The said Ganesh has signed on the back of the cheque and received the same. He has produced the said cheque at Ex.D2 and D5. In the cross examination it is elicited that the account which has in their bank relates to the accused and he denies that the cheques at Ex.D4 to 5 did not pertain to the complainant. Therefore, revealing entire evidence on record, I find that the defence of the accused has been made properly and acceptable. The accused also has not taken any false defence like loss cheque lost of misuse of cheque or that the cheque can be misused through this complainant etc.,\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe core legal issue in this case is whether the lower court correctly applied the provisions of section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act while convicting the accused and directing the deposit of 50% of the compensation amount. The lower court's decision was based on the conviction for an offense under section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act and the direction to deposit 50% of the compensation amount.\n\nIn our assessment, the lower court's judgment appears to be correct in light of the evidence and arguments presented. The provision under section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act requires the accused to pay compensation to the party suffering due to the dishonored cheque, and the court has the discretion to impose a condition for deposit of the compensation amount.\n\nIn the present case, the lower court has taken into account the facts and circumstances while convicting the accused and directing the deposit of 50% of the compensation amount. The court's decision to impose a condition for deposit of the compensation amount is reasonable and in line with the provisions of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\nTherefore, the appeal is dismissed, as the lower court's decision is in accordance with the applicable law and the evidence presented."

The gist of the allegation in the complaint is as follows:- The accused had issued a cheque for Rs. 1,00,000/- to one Justin John towards discharge of his outstanding liability. The complainant is the power of attorney holder of Justin John. The cheque was issued on 26.02.2004 and Justin John went abroad on 06.05.2004.

The accused denied the incriminating circumstances brought out against him during his questioning under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C and, in support of the defence case, got himself was examined as DW1 and also DW2, the Branch Manager of his Bank. Exts.D1 to D4(a) were marked on the defence side. The defence put up by the accused was that he was the Director of a Company by name Grace Communication and Services (P) Ltd, of which PW1's son James Shine Mathew was the Managing Director. The Company had incurred certain debts and the Managing Director had borrowed amounts from various persons, towards the discharge of which, blank cheques collected from the Directors of the Company, including the accused, were issued, without their knowledge or consent. By misusing one such cheque, the present compliant is filed.  In order to substantiate his defence, the accused produced Ext.D1; copy of the notice issued by him, requiring James Shine Mathew to return Ext.P2 cheque. Ext.D3 is the acknowledgment card evidencing receipt of the notice by James Shine Mathew. Ext.D4 is a copy of the stop payment letter dated 21.05.2004 issued to the accused, requiring his bank not to make payment towards Ext.P2 cheque pointing out that there were pending issues between the accused and James Shine Mathew; the Managing Director of Grace Communication and Services Pvt. Ltd.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n. Assailing the findings of the trial court, the learned Counsel for the appellant would submit that though the accused had produced Ext.D2, claiming to be the reply notice issued on receipt of Ext.P5 demand notice, the trial court itself had found that Ex.D2 could not be accepted in evidence.  It is pointed out that Ext.D2 is dated 15.08.2004, which being Independence Day was a holiday, and is hence indicative of the character of the accused. It is contended that the complainant having established execution of the cheque, the trial court committed a mistake in coming to the conclusion that the accused had succeeded in rebutting the presumption under Section 139 of the N.I.Act, based on surmises and conjectures. . It is submitted that even if it is accepted that the accused had caused Ext.D1 notice to be issued to James Shine Mathew, that will not lead to the irresistible conclusion that the cheque was not issued in favour of the complainant.  It is contended that no reliance could be placed on Ext.D3 acknowledgment card, the necessary particulars having not been entered therein. That, in the event of the acknowledgment card not being accepted as proof of service of Ext.D1 notice, there was no other proof regarding the serving of Ext.D1; is the contention.  It is contended that the legal position that a complaint under Section 138 can be filed and maintained through the power of attorney holder is well settled. It is submitted that the conclusion arrived at by the trial court was erroneous and hence, liable to be corrected in appeal. The learned Counsel for the appellant would submit that personal knowledge of the power of attorney holder regarding the transaction and issuance of the cheque was specifically stated in his proof affidavit filed before the trial court and that, even otherwise, all details regarding the power of attorney's knowledge about the transaction was brought out in the cross-examination of PW1.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe learned Counsel for the accused raised a primarily objection against the maintainability of the complaint.  The learned counsel for the accused has raised a further contention that Ext.P1 power of attorney do not contain any specific recital authorising the power of attorney holder to give evidence on behalf of the complainant. On a careful reading of Ext.P1 power of attorney, it is evident that necessary recital authorising the power of attorney holder to appear before court is contained therein.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n On a detailed consideration of the evidence tendered, the trial court found the version put forward by the accused to be more probable and on that basis, held the accused to have succeeded in rebutting the presumption under Section 139 of the N.I.Act. \n",
    "Case_Result": "It was found that the complainant had failed to establish that the cheque had been issued by the accused towards the discharge of a legally enforceable debt due to the complainant.11. A reading of the judgment, leave no scintilla of doubt that, when a complaint under Section 138 of the N.I.Act is instituted through a power of attorney holder, specific averment with regard to the knowledge of the power of attorney holder about the transaction and the issuance of the cheque has to be spelt out in the complaint. A perusal of the complaint in the instant case shows that, other than a statement that \"as the complainant had to go abroad to U.K., he had executed a registered power of attorney on 03.05.2004, authorising the power of attorney holder to present Ext.P2 cheque and to collect the amount as per the cheque and in case of non-payment, to initiate necessary legal action against the drawer of the cheque for and on behalf of the complainant\", absolutely nothing has been stated regarding the personal knowledge of the power of attorney holder about the transaction between the complainant and the accused leading to the issuance of Ext.P2 cheque.The contention being devoid of merit, cannot be accepted. Going by the decision in Narayanan, the personal knowledge of the power of attorney holder regarding the transaction has to be specifically spelt out in the complaint itself, in the absence of which the complaint will not be maintainable.It was the duty of the trial court to scrutinize the complaint and to find out as to whether the necessary assertions regarding the personal knowledge of the power of attorney holder about the transaction, is incorporated in the complaint.In the absence of such details, cognizance should not have been taken on the complaint. The defective complaint on which cognizance was illegally taken, cannot subsequently be improved on the basis of the statements in the proof affidavit or the testimony of the power of attorney holder. Therefore, the contention of the learned Counsel for the accused that the complaint was not maintainable has to be accepted.The next contention is based on Exts.D1, D3 and D4, relied on by the trial court. It is submitted that though the allegation is to the effect that Ext.P2 cheque was issued on 26.02.2004 and PW1 had admitted that the accused had promised to repay the cheque amount by 31.03.2004 and the complainant had left India only by 6.05.2004, absolutely no demand was made for payment of the cheque amount was made while the complainant was in India. It is pointed out that the cheque was presented for encashment only in July, 2004. In the meanwhile, Ext.D1 notice had been issued to James Shine Mathew, the son of PW1, demanding return of Ext.P2 cheque. Ext.D3 evidences receipt of the notice by James Shine Mathew. Even though the learned Counsel for the appellant raised a contention that in the absence of necessary entries in Ext.D3, the same cannot be relied upon, I am forced to reject the contention for the reason that Ext.D3 contains the signature of the addressee and the date of receipt of the notice. Another crucial aspect is that, even after receipt of Ext.D1 notice, neither was any reply sent by James Shine Mathew nor was the cheque presented for collection. The accused had followed up Ext.D1 with Ext.D4 stop payment notice issued to his bank. In Ext.D4, the accused had specifically stated that the reason for requesting to stop payment was the dispute between him and James Shine Mathew regarding the conduct of Grace Communication and Services (P) Ltd. It was much later to Exts.D3 and D4 (a) that Ext.P2 cheque was presented for encashment. That too, on the strength of a power of attorney executed on 03.05.2004 Appeal dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 6371d1a553f2cb007e68d1e3\n**Facts**:  This appeal is filed against the judgment in C.C. No. 1329 of 1998 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Karunagappally. The complainant in the above Calendar Case is the appellant. The case of the complainant was that the accused - respondent herein borrowed from him an amount of Rs. 1, 00, 000/- and issued Ext.P1 cheque towards discharge of the above liability which when presented to the bank for encashment was dishonoured for want of sufficient funds in the account of the accused. Since the amount covered by the cheque was not repaid inspite of issuance of notice prescribed under the statute, the appellant filed the complaint.  To prove the case against the accused -respondent, the complainant himself was examined as PW.1 and the Manager of the Bank was examined as PW.2 and Exts.P1 to P6 were produced. On the side of the defence, DWs.1 and 2 were examined and Exts.D1 to D3 were produced. After closing the evidence of the complainant, the accused was questioned under S.313 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. He denied the allegations levelled against him. To come to this conclusion, the Trial Court relied on Ext.D1 notice which showed that the cheque in question was already dishonoured and hence the second notice issued against the accused - respondent was not within the purview of S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Act\").\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: After considering the entire evidence, the Trial Court acquitted the accused on the ground that the complainant failed to file the complaint within one month from the date of acceptance of the notice by the accused.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: The contention of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant is that the evidence of PW.2, the Manager of the Bank and Ext.P6 register maintained by the bank would show that the cheque in question was presented only once, and that was on 18.4.1998. If so, the cause of action for the appellant to file the complaint arises only after 18.4.1998, on getting information from the bank regarding the dishonour of the cheque.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Learned counsel appearing for the respondent relying on the decision of the Apex Court reported in Sadanandan Bhadran v. Madhavan Sunil Kumar (1998 (2) KLT 7651998 (2) KLT 7651998 ILO SC 1179 (SC)) and the decision of this Court reported in Lakshmanan v. Sivarama Krishnan (1995 (1) KLT 259)1995 (1) KLT 259 contends that as per Ext.D1 notice, the cause of action for the appellant to file the complaint against the respondent arises on 23.2.1998 as Ext.D1 notice is dated 23.2.1998.\n**Citation Context**: \n**Analysis**:  Heard the learned counsel appearing on either side and perused the records made available before this Court. A reading of the above clause would show that a payee or the holder in due course of a cheque shall make a demand for the payment of the amount covered by the cheque by issuing a notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque within 15 days of receipt of information from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. In this context, learned counsel appearing for the appellant relies on the decision of the Apex Court reported in Uniplas India Ltd. v. Government of NCT of Delhi (2001 (3) KLT 452001 (3) KLT 452001 ILO SC 310 (SC)) and submits that even if a notice has been issued earlier, the cause of action would arise only after getting information from the bank. The cheque in question was dated 15.2.1998. As per the evidence of PW.2 and Ext.P6 document, it is proved that Ext.P1 cheque was presented to the bank for collection only on 18.4.1998. Ext.P6 register maintained by the bank for receipt and return of cheque would show that the cheque in question was presented only once. That being so, the cause of action for the appellant to send notice or to file the complaint would arise only after receipt of information regarding dishonour of the cheque. The bank should give the information, based on the account maintained in the name of the drawer of the cheque, as to whether the cheque was returned unpaid by the bank either because the amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with the bank. This is clear from the wordings of S.138 of the Act. Dishonour of the cheque or non-payment of the amount covered by a cheque shall be informed by the bank to the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque and that information shall be based on the account standing in the name of the drawer. In other words the information should not be an oral one collected by the complainant. \n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n. The petitioner is the accused in the case S.T No. 60/2017 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Ottapalam. he aforesaid case is instituted upon the complaint filed against the petitioner by the second respondent for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. When the case reached the stage of defence evidence, the petitioner filed an application for examination of a witness by name Smt. Baby, W/o Sundaran.  However, the counsel for the complainant was not ready for the cross-examination of the witness on that day. It appears that even examination-in-chief of the witness was not conducted and the witness was discharged on that day and the case was adjourned to another day. The witness was not present on the next hearing date. Inspite of repeated warrants issued against the witness, her presence could not be secured The aforesaid orders are challenged by the accused in this petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The fact remains that, atleast examination-in-chief of the witness could have been conducted on that day but it was not done.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel for the petitioner contended that the witness Smt. Baby, W/o Sundaran could not be examined on his side not because of any fault of the petitioner.  Learned counsel would point out that it was the counsel for the complainant who sought adjournment of the case when the witness was present in the court. The court discharged the witness even without conducting examination-in-chief. Learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the petitioner is deprived of valuable opportunity to prove her case by the non-examination of the witness.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n Learned counsel for the second respondent/complainant has not disputed the facts narrated earlier. There is no dispute with regard to the fact that the witness appeared before the trial court once but she was not examined on that day.  Learned counsel for the second respondent would submit that warrant was issued against the witness several times but her presence could not be secured and it was in such a situation that the trial court closed the evidence of the petitioner/accused. \nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe trial court allowed examination of the aforesaid witness by the petitioner. Summons was issued from the trial court to the aforesaid witness and she appeared in the trial court.  Therefore, the trial court closed the defence evidence and posted the case for hearing. Then, the petitioner filed an application as Crl.M.P No. 1607/2019 for reopening the evidence on her side for examination of the witness. She also filed application as Crl.M.P No. 1606/2019 for issuing warrant against the witness. As per Ext.P4 order dated 26.12.2019, the learned Magistrate dismissed the application filed by the petitioner for reopening the defence evidence. Consequently, as per Ext.P3 order, the application filed by the petitioner for issuing warrant against the witness was also dismissed.  The trial court discharged the witness on that day on the basis of the submission made by the learned counsel for the complainant that he was not ready for examination of the witness on that day.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and also the second respondent/complainant.It may be true that, inspite of warrant issued against the witness several times, her presence could not be secured. However, Ext.P4 order of the learned Magistrate does not disclose on what grounds or for what reasons the warrants issued against the witness were returned to the court by the police officer concerned.  There is no material to show that the learned Magistrate had verified the endorsements made on the warrants by the police officer concerned regarding the reasons stated for non-execution of the warrants and that the learned Magistrate was satisfied that the presence of the witness could not be secured at all. If the reasons stated or the grounds shown by the police officer concerned for non-execution of the warrants were not satisfactory, the learned Magistrate should have taken appropriate further steps and issued necessary directions to the police officer concerned and ensured that the presence of the witness was secured. If the witness could not be examined by the accused, she would be deprived of her valuable right to defend the case in an effective manner. It is to be remembered that in a case under Section 138 of the N.I Act, the burden is upon the accused to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. Therefore, the accused has to be given all possible opportunities to rebut such presumption. Petition allowed",

Mr. Anand would submit that it was obligatory on the part of the advocate who is an agent of his client to appear on the dates of hearing, more so when an accused had been appearing in person and remained present in court for all the days of hearing.  In any event, it was urged, the High Court committed a serious error in disposing of the appeal only upon hearing a legal aid counsel and even the submissions made by him had not been noticed.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Mr. A. Regunathan, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, however, submitted that in view of the fact that the matter was adjourned for examination of DWs, the learned Magistrate could not have exercised its jurisdiction under Section 256 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: We may, at the outset, notice that before passing the impugned order, the High Court did not choose to serve notice upon the appellant opining that no useful purpose would be served in keeping the appeal pending and one G. Vinodkumar was appointed as a legal aid counsel. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant is before us. Section 256 of the Code provides for disposal of a complaint in default. It entails in acquittal. But, the question which arises for consideration is as to whether the said provision could have been resorted to in the facts of the case as the witnesses on behalf of complainant have already been examined. The date was fixed for examining the defence witnesses. Appellant could have examined witnesses, if he wanted to do the same. In that case, the appearance of the complainant was not necessary. It was for her to cross-examine the witnesses examined on behalf of the defence.  The accused was entitled to file an application under Section 311 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Such an application was required to be considered and disposed of by the learned Magistrate. We have noticed hereinbefore that the complainant did not examine herself as a witness.  She was sought to be summoned again for cross-examination. The said prayer has not yet been allowed. But, that would not mean that on that ground the court would exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Section 256 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 at that stage or the defence would not examine his witnesses. Presence of the complainant or her lawyer would have been necessary, as indicated hereinbefore, only for the purpose of cross- examination of the witnesses examined on behalf of the defence. If she did not intend to do so, she would do so at her peril but it cannot be said that her presence was absolutely necessary.  Furthermore, when the prosecution has closed its case and the accused has been examined under Section 311 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the court was required to pass a judgment on merit of the matter. We are not concerned herein as to whether the constituted attorney of the complainant could represent the complainant. Similar contention of the complainant that the advocate is an agent of his client and it is his duty to appear on behalf of his client, in our opinion, is beyond the scope of this appeal.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe core issue in this case revolves around the examination of a crucial witness (Smt. Baby, W/o Sundaran) by the accused (petitioner) in a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The lower court initially allowed the reopening of evidence for the examination of the witness, but later dismissed the application for reopening, as well as the application for issuing a warrant against the witness. The lower court's decision was based on the absence of the witness despite repeated warrants and the inability to secure her presence.\n\nIn light of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, the primary legal question is whether the lower court's decision to discharge the witness and dismiss the application for reopening evidence was justified. While the petitioner argues that the witness could not be examined due to the counsel for the complainant seeking adjournment, the respondent counters that the witness's presence could not be secured despite issuing several warrants.\n\nUpon critical assessment, it is clear that the lower court's decision to discharge the witness and dismiss the application for reopening evidence was supported by the evidence presented. The witness's absence despite repeated warrants and the inability to secure her presence indicate that the petitioner failed to exercise due diligence in ensuring her attendance.\n\nIn conclusion, the appeal should be allowed, as the lower court's decision appears to be in accordance with the law and the presented evidence. The petitioner's failure to ensure the witness's attendance warrants the discharge of the witness and the dismissal of the application for reopening evidence."

As per Section 20(1) of the Act, a case pending before a court can be considered by the Lok Adalat only when the case is referred to the Lok Adalat by the court. How a matter which is not pending before a court can be taken cognizance of by the Lok Adalat is provided in Section 20(2) of the Act.

The Lok Adalat has considered the dispute in C.C.No.326/2018, the case which was referred to it by the court. The Lok Adalat has also considered a matter relating to a cheque which was not pending before any court and which was not referred to it by the District Legal Services Authority or the Taluk Legal Services Committee. The Lok Adalat had no jurisdiction to consider the matter relating to the cheque, which was not the subject matter of dispute in the case C.C.No.328/2018, unless that matter had been referred to it by the District Legal Services Authority or the Taluk Legal Services Committee. Therefore, Ext.P2 award passed by the Lok Adalat has no sanctity in law and it is liable to be set aside. Petition allowed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9ad4\n**Facts**: The present revision petition has been filed by the petitioner-complainant challenging the judgment passed by LX Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bengaluru in Criminal Appeal No.1035/2017 dated 14.11.2018 only in respect of modifying the sentence and imposing the sentence equal to the cheque amount. The case of the complainant in brief before the Court below is that complainant and accused entered into an agreement to build a housing project under the name and style \"Ville-Denied-Zen\" in property bearing Sy.No.199/1, Kodathi Village and an amount of Rs. 7,00,000/- (Rupees Seven Lakhs Only) was paid by the complainant in advance of the said transaction.  he accused issued the receipt for the same and thereafter, the accused started saying that there are some hurdles in the title over the land on which the said project has been built. When the complainant asked to return the said amount, accused issued the cheque bearing No.518852 dated 26.08.2015 drawn on ICICI Bank, BTM 2nd Stage branch, Bengaluru. When the said cheque was presented for encashment, the same was returned with an endorsement \"Payment stopped by drawer\". Thereafter, a legal notice was issued to the accused on 09.09.2015. After service of notice, the amount has not been paid within 15 days, and as such, a complaint was filed. . In order to prove the case, the complainant got examined himself as PW1 and got marked exhibits as Ex.P1 to Ex.P16. The accused has neither led any evidence nor got marked any exhibits. Being aggrieved by the same, the petitioner-complainant is before this Court.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: After hearing the learned counsel, the trial court convicted the accused and an appeal was preferred against the said order. The Appellate Court apparently allowed the appeal and modified the sentence.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the First Appellate Court while exercising the jurisdiction has exceeded its limit. It is her further submission that the learned Magistrate while passing the impugned order imposed the fine amount equal to twice the amount of the cheque and without any justifiable grounds, the First Appellate Court reduced the sentence equal to the cheque amount.  It is further submitted that as per Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, if any person is convicted and sentenced he can be punished with both imprisonment and fine and if the fine has to be imposed, it shall be for double the cheque amount. Without looking into the said facts and circumstances, the First Appellate Court has wrongly passed the impugned order and reduced the fine amount. On these grounds, she prays to allow the appeal and modify the sentence.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  It is the contention of the accused that it was his wife who had taken the amount and she is responsible for the payment of the said amount.  But when once that the accused has issued the cheque and admits the signature thereon, then under such circumstances, a presumption has to be drawn under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 that in discharge of the said liability, the said cheque-Ex.P1 has been issued. Thereafter, the said presumption has to be rebutted by the accused on preponderance of probabilities. The accused has not appeared into witness box and has not rebutted the said presumtion. Then under such circumstances, the complainant has proved the case as contended by him.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner-complainant. The learned counsel for the respondent remained absent and there is no representation. 8. I have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner-complainant and perused the records.  As could be seen from the records, the accused has neither led any evidence nor got marked any documents and even he has not challenged the judgment passed in Criminal Appeal No.1035/2017. The evidence of PW1 clearly goes to show that an amount of Rs. 7,00,000/- (Rupees Seven Lakhs only) paid to the accused through three cheques and thereafter, the accused has encashed the same. There is sufficient proof of transaction between the complainant and the accused. Even the accused has not disputed the receipt of Rs. 7,00,000/- from the complainant. As could be seen from the judgment of the Trial Court, the accused has been convicted and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs. 14,00,000/- (Rupees Fourteen Lakhs Only) in default, to undergo a S.I. for a period of three months. But as could be seen from the operative portion of the judgment of the First Appellate Court, the conviction was confirmed and the accused was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 7,10,000/- (Rupees Seven lakhs Ten Thousand Only) and in default, he has to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months.  On careful perusal of the judgment of the First Appellate Court, no reasons have been specifically assigned while exercising the discretion vested with the Court. I am conscious of the fact that the Sessions Court has got discretionary power to reduce the sentence. However, the Sessions Court has to advert the reasons as to why the accused is entitled for reduction of the sentence.  As per Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 it gives the discretion to the Court to impose a sentence of fine which will be double the cheque amount or also imprisonment, which may extend to two years. The Court has to ascertain the conduct of the accused during the pendency of the proceedings and the transaction which has taken place and also the defence taken by the accused. The learned Sessions Judge without considering all the facts and circumstances, simply straightaway by the submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellant, has passed the impugned order.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "**ALLOWED**\n\nThe main issue of the case is whether the Lok Adalat had jurisdiction to pass an award in respect of a matter which was not referred to it.

The petitioner's argument is valid as per the provisions of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\nHence, the appeal is allowed and the lower court's judgment is set aside.

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe petitioner is the accused in the cases C.C.Nos.8/2015 and 158/2015 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate (N.I Act Cases), Ernakulam. The aforesaid cases are instituted upon the complaint filed against the petitioner by the first respondent for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The two cases are being tried jointly. When the aforesaid cases reached the stage of final hearing, the first respondent/complainant filed an application as Crl.M.P.No.10421/2019 in the trial court under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Code') for reopening the evidence in the cases and to issue summons to two witnesses for giving evidence and also for production of documents. This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code by the accused in the cases for quashing Annexure-A4 order passed by the trial court.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, if the evidence of the complainant is reopened and if the complainant is allowed to adduce further evidence in the cases, it would cause serious prejudice to the accused as it would amount to filling up of the lacuna in the case of the complainant. The complainant is an advertising company. The case of the complainant is that the accused is the proprietor of 'Madona Global Incorporates' and that the accused had published advertisements through the complainant on credit basis and the cheques were issued by the accused towards payment of the bills issued by the complainant.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe plea taken by the accused during the trial of the cases is that he is not the proprietor of 'Madona Global Incorporates' and that he had only introduced Mr.Sreekumar Sreevalasan, who is the licensee of 'Madona Global Incorporates' to the complainant.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n. Inspite of vehement objection raised by the petitioner/accused, the trial court allowed the aforesaid application as per Annexure-A4 order. The trial court allowed the aforesaid application stating as follows: \"Considering the reasons stated in the petition and for the just disposal of the case, this petition is allowed.\"\n",
    "Case_Result": "6. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner. The accused had earlier filed an application for summoning certificate issued by the registering authority under Section 10 of the Emigration Act, 1983 in respect of 'Madona Global Incorporates' and to issue summons to a witness to prove that document. The aforesaid petition was dismissed by the trial court. The accused then approached this Court and challenged the dismissal of the application filed by him in Crl.M.C.No.6123/2019. This Court dismissed Crl.M.C.No.6123/2019. It is pertinent here to note that, while dismissing Crl.M.C.No.6123/2019, this Court had observed that it is the burden of the complainant to establish that the accused is the proprietor of 'Madona Global Incorporates' as alleged in the complaint. The witnesses sought to be summoned by the complainant are the Managers of the two banks in which the accused is maintaining account. The documents sought to be proved through these witnesses are the account opening form and other documents showing the address of the accused given in the bank.Evidently, the attempt of the complainant is to prove that the accused has opened accounts in the banks describing himself as the proprietor of 'Madona Global Incorporates'.. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I find that the examination of the witnesses sought to be summoned by the complainant and the production of documents sought to be proved through such witnesses, are essential to the just decision in the cases.There is no merit in the contention of the petitioner/accused that it would cause serious prejudice to him. It would cause prejudice to him only if he has taken any false plea or defence during the trial of the case. It is true that Annexure-A4 order passed by the trial court is not a lengthy one. However, the trial court has observed that for the just disposal of the cases, the petition filed by the complainant has to be allowed.14. It is also true that the petition was filed by the complainant at a belated stage. However, it cannot be found that the purpose of the petition is to fill up the lacuna in the case of the complainant. Section 311 of the Code states that any Court may, at any stage of any inquiry, trial or other proceeding under the Code, summon any person as a witness, or examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness, or recall and re-examine any person already examined; and the Court shall summon and examine or recall and re-examine any such person if his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just decision of the case.The first part of Section 311 of the Code is permissive and it gives purely discretionary authority to the Court and enables it at any stage of inquiry, trial or other proceedings under the Code to act in one of the three ways, namely, (i) to summon any person as a witness; or (ii) to examine any person in attendance, though not summoned as a witness; or (iii) to recall and re-examine any person already examined. The second part, which is mandatory, imposes an obligation on the Court (i) to summon and examine or (ii) to recall and re-examine any such person, if his evidence appears to be essential to the just decision of the case.The Court has wide power under this provision to even recall witnesses for re-examination or further examination, necessary in the interests of justice, but the same has to be exercised after taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each case. The power under this provision shall not be exercised if the Court is of the view that the application has been filed as an abuse of the process of law.17. It is well settled that the power conferred under Section 311 of the Code should be invoked by the Court only to meet the ends of justice. Petition dismissed",

The case of the petitioner/complainant before the court below is that he has filed a private complaint as against the respondent/accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, (hereinafter referred to as \"N.I.Act\" for short). Being aggrieved by the same, the accused preferred an appeal before the first Appellate Court in CRL.A.No.25225/2018. During the pendency of appeal, both accused as well as complainant filed separate applications i.e., I.A.Nos.4 and 5 under Section 391 of Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as 'Cr.P.C' for short) for adducing additional evidence and subsequently, both the parties filed a joint memo for disposing the applications and permitting the parties to lead fresh evidence by remanding the matter to the trial Court. \n**Ruling by Lower Court**: After the trial, the accused was convicted and sentenced by the trial Court ordering to pay fine amount of Rs. 5,000/- and compensation of Rs. 18,58,500/- payable by the respondent/accused to the petitioner/complainant.  Based upon the memo, the first Appellate Court set aside the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court and also referred I.A.Nos.4 and 5 filed under Section 391 of Cr.P.C to the trial Court to consider and dispose of the matter on merits, which is challenged by the petitioner/complainant under this revision.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the petitioner/complainant has contended that the very provision of Section 391 of Cr.P.C says that the application filed for leading additional evidence before the first Appellate Court. Such being the case, the first Appellate Court ought to have recorded the evidence as additional evidence before it or it could have sent back the matter to the Magistrate for recording the evidence or sending back for consideration of appeal on merits, but the judgment of conviction and sentence cannot be set aside, which amounts to an acquittal. Therefore, the order challenged under revision suffers from illegality. Hence, prays for setting aside the same.\n**Argument by Respondent**: 6. Learned counsel for the respondent/accused is not present before the Court.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner/complainant. Learned counsel for the respondent has remained absent.  On perusal of the record, it is an admitted fact that the respondent/accused was convicted by the trial Court in C.C.No.53556/2016 dated 02.11.2018. Being aggrieved by the same, the accused filed an appeal before the first Appellate Court. It is also an admitted fact that both the complainant as well as accused filed I.A.Nos.4 and 5 under Section 391 of Cr.P.C for leading additional evidence and also filed a joint memo for remitting the matter to the Magistrate in order to mark fresh documents and to lead further evidence. Based upon the joint memo, the first Appellate Court has set aside the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court and remitted the matter back to the trial Court for fresh consideration. In my considered opinion, the first Appellate Court ought not to have set aside the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court even though the parties have filed a joint memo for leading additional evidence and remitting the matter back to the Magistrate for recording fresh evidence. Apart from that, I.A.Nos.4 and 5 were filed under Section 391 of Cr.P.C before the first Appellate Court seeking permission to lead additional evidence. Such being the case, sending I.A.Nos.4 and 5 filed under Section 391 of Cr.P.C to the Magistrate Court without passing any order on the said applications is incorrect and against the procedure under Section 391 of Cr.P.C. . On bare reading of Section 391 of Cr.P.C., it clearly goes to show that while dealing with any appeal by the Appellate Court, if additional evidence is necessary, shall record its reasons and may either take such evidence itself, or direct it to be taken by a Magistrate. Thereupon receipt of such evidence the first Appellate Court shall proceed to dispose of the matter on merits. Section 391 of Cr.P.C is synonymous to Order 41 Rule 27 of Code of Civil Procedure in civil suits for leading additional evidence at the appellate stage.\n",

The revision petition is filed by the accused in C.C.No.849 of 1996, a case in which cognizance was taken on the basis of a complaint filed by the first respondent herein alleging commission of offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short \"the N.I.Act\").\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n When the matter was taken up for consideration, the learned counsel for the revision petitioner submitted that the letter sent to the revision petitioner regarding the posting of the case, has been returned with the endorsement that 'the revision petitioner is no more'.  It is submitted that none among the near relatives of the revision petitioner have come forward to further prosecute the revision petition.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n3. The first respondent had filed the complaint with the following allegations:- That the accused had demanded a sum of Rs. 15,000/- from him and had issued a cheque for the same amount on 29.06.1996 drawn on the South Indian Bank, Chelakkara Branch. On presentation of the cheque, the same was dishonoured for want of sufficient funds in the account of the accused.  The lawyer notice demanding payment of the cheque amount was submitted within time and though the accused accepted the notice, no reply was sent nor was the demand met, hence the complaint.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n On a consideration of the allegations and the evidence, the learned Magistrate found the accused guilty of the offence under Section 138 of the N.I.Act and sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for two months and to pay an amount of Rs. 17,000/- as compensation under Section 357 (3) of Cr.P.C.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9a0c\n**Facts**: Though this petition is listed for admission, with consent of both parties, the matter is taken up for final disposal. Parties are referred to as per their status before the trial Court.  This revision petition has been preferred by accused aggrieved by judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 22.2.2019, passed by I Addl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Dharwad, in C. C.No.22/2018, convicting petitioner for the offence punishable under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('the Act' for short) and sentencing him to pay a fine of Rs. 4,52,000/-, in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months. Out of the fine amount, Rs. 4,51,000/- was ordered to be paid to complainant and Rs. 1,000/- was ordered to be paid to State.  Brief facts leading to filing of this revision petition are that, it is the case of complainant that himself and accused are well known to each other and due to their acquaintance and intimacy, accused received loan of Rs. 4,50,000/- from complainant and issued a cheque for Rs. 4,50,000/- towards repayment of loan vide cheque bearing No.319509 dated 11.8.2017.  On presentation of said cheque, the same came to be dishonoured for the reason 'funds insufficient' on 1.11.2017. Thereafter complainant got issued legal notice to accused on 13.11.2017. Despite service of notice to accused, no reply was sent and the amount so demanded was not repaid. Hence complainant filed a complaint under section 200 of Cr.P. C. for the offence punishable under section 138 of the Act. 6. After filing of complaint, cognizance was taken by the trial Court and on receipt of summons, accused appeared before the Court and pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried and accordingly he was tried. Thereafter complainant's sworn statement was recorded and it was treated as his evidence and he got marked Exs.P.1 to P.5 and closed his side.  Thereafter, statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P.C. was recorded. Accused denied all incriminating evidence against him, but he did not choose to cross examine complainant neither let-in evidence on his behalf Aggrieved by the said judgment, accused challenged the same before the District and Sessions Court in Crl. A. No.25/2019. On examining the material evidence placed before the Court and after re-appreciating the evidence on record, the appellate Court came to conclusion that accused is guilty of offence punishable under section 138 of the Act. Aggrieved by the judgment of conviction by trial Court and confirmation by appellate Court, accused is before this Court challenging the legality, correctness and validity of judgments of both the Courts.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  On challenge, the said judgment of trial Court has been confirmed by the Prl. District and Sessions Court, Dharwad, by judgment dated 1.7.2020 in Crl.A. No.25/2019.  On the basis of material evidence and documents produced by complainant, the trial Court came to a conclusion that complainant has proved necessary ingredients of section 138 of the Act and convicted accused for the offence punishable under section 138 of the Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 4,52,000/-. Appellate Court held that as per law Court is empowered to impose fine of double the amount of cheque. It has confirmed the judgment of trial Court and did not interfere with the same.  Thereafter, on 22.2.2019 judgment was pronounced by trial Court convicting accused for the offence punishable under section 138 of N.I. Act. Aggrieved by this judgment accused preferred an appeal.  On considering contentions of accused and relying on the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank Association (supra), appellate Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order passed by trial Court.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: . Learned counsel for petitioner contends that order of conviction passed by trial Court and confirmation of the same by appellate Court is not in accordance with law and opposed to principles of natural justice.  The same deserves to be set aside and an opportunity has to be provided to accused to defend his case effectively. It is further contended by learned counsel for petitioner that since no opportunity was provided to accused to cross examine PW.1/complainant, he was unable to confront the witness by producing material evidence in support of his case to disprove the case of complainant. 9. It is his contention that complainant has misused the cheque to make unlawful gain and the same was not issued for realization of any legally recoverable debt. He further contends that both the Courts have gravely erred in coming to a conclusion that case of complainant is proved beyond reasonable doubt despite not providing any opportunity to accused to rebut the presumption cast against him. Learned counsel further contends that the judgment of both Courts suffers from serious infirmities and on account of non providing sufficient opportunities to accused, the same deserves to be reversed. On these aspects learned counsel seeks to allow this revision petition and set aside the orders passed by both the Courts and to acquit petitioner.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Per contra, learned counsel for respondent contends that order passed by trial Court convicting accused and confirmed by appellate Court is in accordance with law and the materials placed on record. The same does not call for any interference. He contends that complainant has followed necessary procedure for adducing evidence and sufficient time was provided to accused to cross examine PW.1, but the same has not been utilized and rightly trial Court has convicted accused for the aforesaid offence. . Learned counsel further contends that intent of legislature is to dispose of the case pertaining to Negotiable Instruments Act within a period of six months in accordance with law. Trial Court accorded sufficient opportunity to accused to examine witnesses, but despite providing sufficient opportunity, the same was not utilized and hence convicted accused for the aforesaid offence which has been confirmed by appellate Court. Learned counsel for respondent contends that there is no illegality or perversity in the orders passed by trial Court and appellate Court. The same is in accordance with law and the precedent laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court for disposal of cases punishable under section 138 of the Act.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Heard Shri T.R.Patil, learned counsel for petitioner and Shri Praveen P. Tarikar, learned counsel for respondent. .. Having heard learned counsel for petitioner and respondent, a short point that arises for consideration is whether there is any illegality or perversity committed by the Court below in passing the impugned order. . During the course of arguments before this Court, learned counsel for petitioner has produced order sheet of trial Court to show that no opportunity was provided to him. On perusal of order sheet, it is seen that on 21.1.2019 accused appeared before trial Court, filed an application for grant of bail under section 436 of Cr.P. C.  The same was allowed and on the same day plea of accused was recorded, wherein accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Trial Court relying on the judgment of Hon' ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association and others vs. Union of India and others, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 590, treated the sworn statement of complainant as evidence, closed the side of complainant and recorded statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C. and posted the matter on 24.1.2019 for evidence of accused.  On 24.1.2019, both parties tried to settle the matter but same was unsuccessful and accordingly the matter was posted for accused evidence on 8.2.2019, on which date accused remained absent. Since no evidence was adduced by accused, the same was taken as nil and thereafter matter was posted for arguments on 16.2.2019.  On 16.2.2019 accused remained absent, no representation was made, arguments of accused were taken as nil and the matter was posted for judgment on 22.2.2019.  . During the course of arguments before this Court, learned counsel for petitioner has pleaded that he has a very good case on merit and if an opportunity is provided, he will be able to establish and rebut the presumption cast on him by disproving the case of complainant. Learned counsel has restricted his argument to remit the case back to trial Court for adjudication of the matter by providing an opportunity to adduce defence evidence.  It is seen in the orders passed on 21.1.2019 that trial Court has relied on a judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association (supra) and has rightly treated the sworn statement as evidence and thereafter recorded statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C. and posted the matter for defence evidence Thereafter matter was adjourned for two dates providing opportunity to accused to adduce evidence. Since no evidence was let-in by accused, the matter was posted for judgment, pursuant to which judgment was pronounced.  Considering the intent of legislature and the judgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association (supra), wherein guidelines have been laid down with regard to disposal of matters pertaining to Negotiable Instruments Act. It is seen that there is no illegality committed, per-se, in treating sworn statement as evidence and recording statement of accused under section 313 of Cr. P.C. on the same day and posting the matter for defence evidence.  As this is a summary trial, parties can adduce evidence by way of affidavit and there is nothing wrong in treating the sworn statement as evidence and recording statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C., on the same day. In the aforesaid judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court, it is held that, Courts must ensure examination-in-chief and cross-examination and re-examination of complainant to be conducted within three months and thereafter accused must examine witnesses and be available for cross-examination as and when directed by trial Court and there is no dispute that speedy and expeditious procedure should be adopted by trial Court dealing with the matters pertaining to section 138 of the N.I.Act.  In the present case on hand, during the course of arguments learned counsel for petitioner has submitted that an opportunity may be given to him to cross examine complainant and to lead his evidence for which conditions may be imposed by this Court and he is agreeable to deposit entire cheque amount within one month from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.  It is seen from records that the trial Court has followed the ratio and the principles laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank Association stated supra. But, what is to be seen here is whether in order to provide substantial justice to parties, an opportunity could be provided to accused by imposing certain conditions which should not be detrimental to the interest of the complainant. Learned counsel for the complainant consents to the matter being remanded to trial Court with a condition that accused deposits entire cheque amount and a specific time limit is provided for adducing evidence by accused and for conclusion of the case.  In such circumstances, in the interest of principle of natural justice and with an intention to provide an opportunity for accused to put forth his case by cross examining the complainant and by adducing his own evidence where no harm or grave injustice would be caused to complainant, the matter could be remanded back to trial Court. This Court is not subscribing to the lackadaisical attitude of accused in not availing opportunity provided by trial Court. Nevertheless, in the interest of principle of natural justice and to provide substantial justice to parties and with consent of counsel for the petitioner and counsel for respondent this matter could be remanded to trial Court for recording of evidence of accused and for cross examination of PW.1 complainant.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue of the case is whether the accused committed an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act for dishonouring a cheque issued for a loan amount and failing to honour the demand despite notice. The lower court found the accused guilty and sentenced him to imprisonment and compensation."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe petitioner is the accused in the case S.T.No.137/2017 on the file of the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pathanamthitta. 2. The aforesaid case was instituted upon the complaint filed by the second respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'). he petitioner filed Crl.Appeal.No.71/2019 before the Court of Session, Pathanamthitta challenging the conviction entered against him and the sentence imposed on him by the trial court. The appeal was admitted by the Sessions Court. 5. The petitioner filed Crl.M.P.No.4740/2019 for suspension of the sentence imposed on him by the trial court.  6. Annexure-A1 order is assailed by the petitioner on the ground that the direction given by the Sessions Court to deposit 20% of the amount of compensation awarded by the trial court is illegal since he has filed insolvency petition as I.P.No.1/2017 before the Sub Court, Pathanamthitta. In fact, exercise of the power under Section 148(1) of the Act is the rule and non-exercise of such power is the exception.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n8. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that Annexure-A1 order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, directing the petitioner to deposit 20% of the amount of compensation awarded by the trial court, is illegal. Learned counsel would contend that the petitioner has instituted insolvency petition as I.P.No.1/2017 before the Sub Court, Pathanamthitta, and therefore, the Sessions Court should not have made a direction for deposit of amount under Section 148(1) of the Act. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that since the petitioner has instituted insolvency proceedings the appellate court should not have made a direction under Section 148(1) of the Act. . There is no merit in the contention of the petitioner that the appellate court should not have made a direction to him deposit 20% of the compensation awarded by the trial court for the reason that he has filed insolvency petition. \nArgument by the Respondent:\nLearned counsel for the second respondent invited the attention of this Court to the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Sri.Srinivasa Trading Company v. State of A.P (1998 Cri.L.J 903) and the decisions of the Madras High Court in Kannan v. Santhanam (1999 Cri.L.J 2236) and Thangaraj v. Murugesan (1999 Cri.L.J 3436) and contended that mere pendency of insolvency proceedings instituted by the drawer of a cheque would not disentitle the payee of a cheque to initiate and continue criminal proceedings against the drawer for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n. After trial, the learned Magistrate found the petitioner guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act and convicted him thereunder and sentenced him to simple imprisonment for a period of three months and also directed him to pay an amount of Rs. 9,00,000/- as compensation to the complainant and also ordered that, in default of payment of compensation, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one month. Learned Sessions Judge allowed the aforesaid application and passed Annexure-A1 order, which reads as follows :\\n\\n\"Heard the counsel, perused the affidavit. Execution of the sentence passed by the lower court is hereby suspended on executing a bond for Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the lower court. In addition to that the appellant/accused shall deposit 20% of the compensation amount ordered by the lower court within sixty days from this date. Return of notice to 29.11.2019.\" Therefore, in normal course, while suspending the sentence imposed on an accused by the trial court, the appellate court shall direct deposit of 20% of the amount of compensation awarded by the trial court. The appellate court is not obliged to record any special reasons for issuing a direction under Section 148(1) of the Act to the appellant to deposit 20% of the amount of compensation awarded by the trial court. It is only when the appellate court does not make a direction under Section 148(1) of the Act for deposit of the amount that it has to assign special reasons.\n",
    "Case_Result": "7. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the second respondent.9. Section 148(1) of the Act provides that, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in an appeal by the drawer against conviction under Section 138, the appellate court may order the appellant to deposit such sum which shall be a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial court.10. Section 148 was introduced in the Act with effect from 01.09.2018. Section 148(1) of the Act empowers the court, in which an accused has filed appeal against conviction under Section 138 of the Act, to direct him to deposit such sum which shall be a minimum of 20% of the amount of fine or compensation awarded by the trial court.Though the expression used in Section 148(1) of the Act is \"may\", it is generally to be construed as a \"rule\" or \"shall\". Absence of a direction by the appellate court to deposit 20% of the amount of fine or compensation can only by way of an exception for which special reasons are to be assigned. Section 148(1) of the Act confers power upon the appellate court to pass an order pending appeal to direct the appellant-accused to deposit an amount which shall not be less than 20% of the fine or compensation either on an application filed by the original complainant or even on the application filed by the appellant-accused under Section 389 Cr.P.C to suspend the sentence (See Surinder Singh Deswal v. Virender Gandhi : AIR 2019 SC 2956).There is no such restriction imposed on the appellate court by the statute.. Even if filing of insolvency petition by the petitioner had to be taken as a special reason for not making a direction under Section 148(1) of the Act to deposit 20% of the amount of compensation, the appellant/accused who filed the application for suspension of sentence should have pointed out such a circumstance in that application. Then the appellate court could have considered whether such circumstance constitutes a special reason for not making any direction under Section 148(1) of the Act. In the instant case, admittedly, the petitioner had not pointed out any special circumstance or reason before the appellate court for not making a direction under Section 148(1) of the Act for deposit of 20% of the amount of compensation awarded by the trial court.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9856\n**Facts**: ) These three petitions are filed aggrieved of orders dated 6.1.2021 whereby Additional Sessions Judge, Faridabad, suspended the sentence awarded under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'the Act') subject to deposit of 20% of the compensation amount within a period of one month. It would be appropriate to note at this stage that the period to deposit was extended from time to time. (4) Aggrieved of conviction, appeals alongwith applications for suspension of sentence were filed. On 6.1.2021 notice was issued in the appeal, the sentence was suspended on furnishing of bail bonds of Rs.1,00,000/- and subject to deposit of 20% of the compensation amount.  The Appellate Court proceeded on the basis that there is no discretion with the Court to waive the pre deposit of 20%. The Appellate Court never dealt with the pleas raised for non-deposit. \n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The petitioners were convicted by Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Faridabad, vide judgment dated 3.3.2020 and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for one year under Section 138 of the Act and to further pay compensation of Rs. 1,05,00,000/- vide order dated 8.10.2020 (7) Relevant portion of the impugned order is quoted below: ''The provisions of Section 148 of NI Act perused. It transpires that it has been specifically mentioned that the appellate court may order the appellant to deposit such sum which shall be a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court. In the case in hand, the trial court has awarded compensation of Rs.1,05,00,000/-. Though the word may and shall have been used in the sentence, but it does not give discretion to the Court to waive the said amount. Therefore, the request of the appellant is declined and the application is dismissed.'' \n**Argument by Petitioner**: The grievance raised by learned counsel for the petitioners is that the Appellate Court while passing the impugned orders has not considered the decision of Supreme Court in Surinder Singh Deswal @ Col. S.S. Deswal and others Versus Virender Gandhi, 2019 AIR (Supreme Court) 2956 : (AIRonline 2019 SC 327).\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Learned counsel for the complainant submits that as per the decision of Supreme Court in Surinder Singh Deswal's case (supra), reasons are to be recorded only if waiver of pre-deposit is to be granted. In the present case, as there was a direction to deposit 20% of compensation, no reasons were required to be recorded 10) The contention of counsel for the complainant that reasons are to be assigned only when the waiver is allowed and no reason is to be given if there is direction of pre-deposit of the compensation amounts seems impressive at the first blush but it is not so.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 9) As per Supreme Court decision while dealing with the exceptional circumstances, the Court has to justify the direction for waiver by assigning reasons.  . The matter needs to be looked from another angle. If a prayer for waiver of pre-deposit has been made before the Appellate Court, the minimum requirement for compliance of principle of natural justice would be that the litigant comes to know from the order passed that the plea raised by him were considered and dealt with. 12. From the perusal of impugned order, it is evident that the Supreme Court decision was not considered. It is not forth coming from the order that the pleas raised by the petitioner for waiver of pre-deposit were dealt with, it is so, as the Court proceeded on the basis that there is no discretion for waiver\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "1. The main issue of the case revolves around the interpretation and application of Section 148(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, specifically regarding the suspension of sentence and deposit of compensation amount by the petitioner. The lower court ruled that the appellate court should not have made a direction to the petitioner to deposit 20% of the compensation awarded by the trial court, due to the petitioner's insolvency proceedings.\n\n2. Analyzing the lower court's judgment, it appears that the court followed the general rule that exercise of the power under Section 148(1) of the Act is the rule and non-exercise of such power is the exception. However, the court erred in its interpretation of insolvency proceedings as a bar for issuing a direction under Section 148(1) of the Act. The decisions cited by the respondent (Sri.Srinivasa Trading Company v. State of A.P, Kannan v. Santhanam, and Thangaraj v. Murugesan) support the position that mere pendency of insolvency proceedings does not disentitle the payee of a cheque to initiate and continue criminal proceedings against the drawer for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, the appeal should be allowed. The lower court's judgment is incorrect as insolvency proceedings do not bar the issuance of a direction under Section 148(1) of the Act. The petitioner's insolvency proceedings do not impede the proceedings against him for the offence under Section 138 of the Act.\n\nOutput: ALLOWED"

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n The revision petitioner is the accused in the case S.T.No.450/2013 on the file of the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kollam. 3. The petitioner filed Crl.A.No.48/2015 before the Court of Session, Kollam challenging the order of conviction and sentence passed against him by the trial court 4. The concurrent findings of guilty and conviction made against him by the courts below and the sentence imposed on him by the appellate court are challenged by the accused in this revision petition. 6. The case of the complainant/first respondent is as follows: On 20.10.2012, the accused borrowed an amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- from the complainant and he issued a post-dated cheque for the amount in discharge of the liability and made the complainant to believe that sufficient amount would be in the account on the date of the cheque. The complainant presented the cheque in the bank. It was returned unpaid for the reason that there was no sufficient amount in the account of the accused. The complainant sent a lawyer notice to the accused demanding payment of the amount of the cheque. The accused received the notice. He did not send any reply. He did not pay the amount. . During the trial of the case, the complainant got herself examined as PW1 and Exts.P1 to P5 documents were marked on her side. No evidence was adduced by the accused. When examined as PW1, the complainant gave evidence that the accused had borrowed Rs. 2,00,000/- from her on 20.10.2012 and that he issued Ext.P1 cheque in discharge of the liability.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the complainant has not proved execution of the cheque by the accused. There is no merit in this contention. The accused has no plea that the cheque does not bear his signature. Not even a definite plea was raised by him with regard to the circumstances under which the complainant came into possession of a cheque which admittedly bears his signature. No evidence was adduced by him to prove the vague plea raised by him that he had given the cheque to a money investment company. The details of the alleged transaction which he had with such money investment company were not disclosed by him. In such circumstances, there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the complainant. 15. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the complainant did not prove that she had the financial capacity to lend the amount of Rs. 2,00,000/-.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n. The plea of the accused was that he had issued the cheque in favour of a money investment company in connection with deposit of amount in that company and that the complainant obtained the aforesaid cheque and misused it.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n2. The trial court found the petitioner guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') and convicted him thereunder.  The trial court sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year and also directed him to pay an amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- as compensation to the complainant and ordered that in default of payment of compensation, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one month. The learned Sessions Judge confirmed the conviction but modified the sentence to imprisonment till the rising of the court and confirmed the direction to pay compensation to the complainant.\n",
    "Case_Result": "5. Heard the learned counsel for the revision petitioner.10. No evidence was adduced by the accused to prove the aforesaid plea. Nothing was also brought out in the cross-examination of PW1 to show that the aforesaid plea is probable.12. The complainant had sent Ext.P3 lawyer notice to the accused demanding payment of the amount of the cheque. The accused had received the notice. He did not send any reply to the notice. If the complainant was a total stranger to him and if he had no transaction with the complainant and if he had given the cheque to any money investment company and if he did not owe Rs. 2,00,000/- to the complainant and if he had not executed and issued the cheque to the complainant in discharge of such liability, the accused would have definitely sent a reply to the statutory notice.He would not have remained silent and inactive on receiving lawyer notice from the complainant demanding a huge amount from him. The fact that the notice of demand, though duly received and acknowledged by the accused, did not evoke any response from him is a crucial circumstance against him. The very fact that the accused failed to reply to the statutory notice under Section 138 of the Act leads to the inference that there is merit in the complainant's version (See Rangappa v. Mohan : AIR 2010 SC 1898).3. There is primarily the evidence of the complainant to explain the circumstances under which she came into possession of the cheque, admittedly drawn on a cheque leaf issued to the accused by his bank to operate his account. The plea raised by the accused with regard to the possession of his cheque by the complainant is vague and not probable. No evidence was adduced to prove the plea. Nothing was also brought out in the cross-examination of PW1 to show that the plea of the accused is probable. The fact that the accused has no reasonable and probable explanation as to how the cheque travelled from his possession to that of the complainant is certainly a crucial aspect while considering the acceptability of the evidence of the complainant.14. When execution of Ext.P1 cheque by the accused is thus proved, the presumption under Section 139 of the Act comes into play. The accused failed to rebut that presumption in any manner.It is only when the financial capacity of the complainant is challenged by the accused that the complainant has obligation to prove the source of the money. In the instant case, the judgments of the courts below do not reveal that any such contention was raised by the accused. Moreover, when the accused could not even raise a probable plea with regard to how his cheque happened to be in the possession of the complainant, the complainant has no obligation to prove source of the money. The complainant is not required to prove the debt as if in a civil case (See Uttam Ram v. Devinder Singh : (2019) 10 SCC 287). Absence of documentary evidence to show the source of funds with the complainant to advance the loan is not a relevant consideration in view of the presumption existing in favour of the complainant by virtue of Section 118 and Section 139 of the Act (See Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel v. State of Gujarat : AIR 2019 SC 1876). Revision dismissed",

The trial court sentenced the petitioner to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months and to pay a fine of Rs. 2,10,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of two months. The trial court also directed that, if the fine amount was realised, it shall be paid to the complainant as compensation. The appellate court confirmed the conviction of the petitioner for the offence under Section 138 of the Act but modified the sentence imposed on the petitioner by the trial court. The appellate court set aside the sentence of simple imprisonment for a period of three months imposed on the petitioner and sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 2,42,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months. The appellate court also directed that, if the fine amount was realised, it shall be paid as compensation to the complainant.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: 12. The complainant admitted that a property had been purchased in the name of his daughter-in-law and that the accused was a witness in the agreement executed at that time.  He denied the fact that the accused had given signed blank cheque as security at the time of the aforesaid transaction.\n**Argument by Respondent**: The plea of the accused was that he was a broker in the land transaction between the daughter-in-law of the complainant and a third party and on the date of signing the agreement in that transaction and when the advance amount was given, he gave a signed blank cheque as security for the advance amount.  It was the plea of the accused that the complainant misused the aforesaid cheque and filed the case. 11. In order to prove the aforesaid plea, the accused examined DW1, who was allegedly present at the time of the transaction between the daughter-in-law of the complainant and the third party. DW1 is also a broker.  He gave evidence in support of the plea of the accused that the accused had given a signed blank cheque as security in the aforesaid transaction. The plea of the accused that he gave a signed blank cheque as security for the amount of advance paid by the daughter-in-law of the complainant at the time of entering into an agreement for purchase of property from a third person is not at all believable. It eludes comprehension why a broker or a real estate agent should give his signed blank cheque as security for the advance amount paid by the purchaser to the seller of the property.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 14. The trial court as well as the appellate court has also taken note of the fact that, in the reply notice sent by the accused to the complainant he had not raised any plea that he had given a signed blank cheque as security at the time of execution of the agreement regarding purchase of property by the daughter-in-law of the complainant. . The trial court as well as the appellate court has appreciated the evidence in the case in the correct perspective. I find no illegality, impropriety or perversity in the appreciation of evidence by the courts below or the findings entered against the petitioner.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe core legal question in this case is whether the accused is guilty of issuing a dishonored cheque, as alleged by the complainant, under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The lower court's ruling was that the accused is indeed guilty of the offense and has been sentenced accordingly.\n\nIn the analysis, the lower court's judgment appears to be well-reasoned and follows the established legal framework under Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. The complainant's evidence, including the cheque in question bearing the accused's signature, and the absence of any defense from the accused, supports the lower court's decision.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that the lower court modified the sentence from imprisonment to compensation in default of payment. This adjustment may warrant further examination by the appellate court. \n\nBased on the analysis, the appeal should be allowed, as the lower court's ruling on the accused being guilty of issuing a dishonored cheque appears to be correct. However, the modification in the sentence from imprisonment to compensation in default of payment deserves further consideration."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n The revision petitioner is the accused in the case C.C.No.1199/2016 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-VIII, Ernakulam. . The petitioner filed Crl.A.No.105/2018 before the Court of Session, Ernakulam challenging the order of conviction and sentence passed against him by the trial court. The concurrent findings of guilty, conviction and sentence made against the petitioner by the courts below are challenged in this revision. 5. The case of the complainant/first respondent was as follows: The complainant and the accused were acquainted with each other. The accused had borrowed a total amount of Rs. 7,00,000/- from the complainant. When the complainant demanded the accused to repay the amount, the accused executed and issued three cheques to her, one cheque dated 02.06.2011 for Rs. 2,00,000/-, another cheque dated 10.07.2011 for Rs. 3,00,000/- and yet another cheque dated 08.08.2011 for Rs. 2,00,000/-, in discharge of the liability. The complainant presented the cheques in the bank.  They were returned unpaid for the reason that there was no sufficient amount in the account of the accused. The complainant sent a lawyer notice to the accused demanding payment of the amount of the cheques. The accused received the notice. He did not send any reply. He did not pay the amount. 6. During the trial of the case, PW1 to PW3 were examined and Exts.P1 to P9 documents were marked on the side of the complainant. No evidence was adduced by the accused. . The complainant was examined as PW1. She gave evidence that the accused had borrowed Rs. 7,00,000/- from her and that the accused executed and issued Ext.P1 series cheques in discharge of the liability. She gave evidence that the accused had received the amount of Rs. 7,00,000/- not in lump on a single occasion but the amount was obtained from her on different occasions. 8. The son of the complainant was examined as PW2. He gave evidence that the accused had received money from his mother. He also gave evidence regarding the execution and delivery of the cheques by the accused to the complainant.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel for the petitioner has mainly raised three contentions before this Court. They are: (1) the complainant has not proved execution of Ext.P1 series cheques by the accused (2) the complainant had no financial capacity to lend an amount of Rs. 7,00,000/- and she failed to prove the source of money and (3) the complaint does not contain details of the transactions between the petitioner and the complainant.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n9. The plea of the accused was that the complainant and himself were living together in a house and that the complainant had clandestinely and fraudulently taken the signed blank cheques which was kept by him in the house and she has misused them. 19. Another contention raised by the accused is that the complaint does not contain the details of the transactions between the complainant and the accused.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n2. The trial court found the petitioner guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') and convicted him thereunder.  The trial court sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months and also directed him to pay an amount of Rs. 7,00,000/- as compensation to the complainant. The learned Additional Sessions Judge confirmed the conviction as well as the sentence against the petitioner and dismissed the appeal. \n",
    "Case_Result": "4. Heard the learned counsel for the revision petitioner.10. No evidence was adduced by the accused to prove the aforesaid plea. He did not explain under what circumstances he had kept signed blank cheques at the house. The plea raised by the accused is not at all probable and believable.There is no merit in the contention that the complainant could not prove execution of Ext.P1 series cheques by the accused. PW1 has given evidence regarding the execution of the cheques by the accused and delivery of the same to her by him. Her evidence in that regard is corroborated by the evidence of PW2. There is no contra evidence. Further, the accused does not dispute the signature in Ext.P1 series cheques. His plea that the signed blank cheques kept by him at the house were taken by the complainant contains the implied admission that the cheques bear his signature. He did not adduce any evidence to prove the aforesaid plea raised by him. In such circumstances, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 regarding the execution of the cheques by the accused has to be believed.The complainant had sent Ext.P4 lawyer notice to the accused demanding payment of the amount of the cheques. The accused had received the notice. He did not send any reply to the statutory notice sent to him by the complainant. If as a matter of fact, he did not owe Rs. 7,00,000/- to the complainant and if he had not executed and issued the cheques to the complainant in discharge of that liability and if the complainant had fradulently obtained the cheques and misused them, the accused would have definitely sent a reply to the statutory notice.He would not have remained silent and inactive on receiving the notice from the complainant demanding a huge amount from him. The fact that the notice of demand, though duly received and acknowledged by the accused, did not evoke any response from him is a crucial circumstance against him. The very fact that the accused failed to reply to the statutory notice under Section 138 of the Act leads to the inference that there is merit in the complainant's version (See Rangappa v. Mohan : AIR 2010 SC 1898).14. There is primarily the evidence of the complainant to explain the circumstances under which she came into possession of the cheques, admittedly drawn on cheque leaves issued to the accused by his bank to operate his account. No contra evidence has been adduced. On broad probabilities, there is no reason to doubt or suspect the statement on oath of the complainant. The fact that the accused has no reasonable and probable explanation as to how the cheques travelled from his possession to that of the complainant is certainly a crucial aspect while considering the acceptability of the evidence of the complainant.15. Once execution of the cheque by the accused is proved, the presumption under Section 139 of the Act comes into play. The burden is upon the accused to rebut the presumption. It is obligatory on the court to raise the presumption under Section 139 of the Act in every case where the factual basis for raising the presumption is established. It is a presumption of law as distinguished from a presumption of fact. When the facts required to form the basis of a presumption of law exists, no discretion is left with the court but to draw the statutory conclusion. But this does not preclude the person against whom the presumption is drawn from rebutting it and proving the contrary. In the case of a mandatory presumption, the burden which rests on the accused person would not be as light as it is where a presumption is raised under Section 114 of the Evidence Act and cannot be held to be discharged merely by reason of the fact that the explanation offered by the accused is reasonable and probable. It must further be shown that the explanation is a true one. The rebuttal does not have to be conclusively established but such evidence must be adduced before the court in support of the defence that the court must either believe the defence to exist or consider its existence to be reasonably probable (See Hiten P. Dalal v. Bratindranath Banerjee: AIR 2001 SC 3897). In the absence of any direct evidence adduced by him to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act, the accused would advance the plea that the complainant had no financial capacity to lend an amount of Rs. 7,00,000/-. It was brought out in evidence that the complainant is a worker in a tiles factory and she was earning only Rs. 400/- per day as wages.17. While considering the financial capacity of the complainant to lend the money, it is to be kept in mind that she had not advanced the amount of Rs. 7,00,000/- to the accused in lump. The version of the complainant is that she had pledged her gold ornaments and also borrowed Rs. 3,00,000/- from one Suresh and raised the money. Ext.P7 is the lawyer notice issued to her by Suresh demanding payment of an amount of Rs. 3,00,000/- from her. It is a notice issued to her prior to the date of Ext.P1 series cheques. The complainant also produced documents to prove pledging of gold ornaments by her. In such circumstances, it has to be found that the complainant had proved the source of the money lent by her to the accused.18. The complainant also proved Ext.P8 agreement executed by the accused by which he had agreed to pay the amount of Rs. 7,00,000/- to the complainant.There is no invariable rule that absence of details regarding the original transaction in the complaint would make the evidence given by the complainant unreliable or the case set up by him improbable. Whether absence of such details in the complaint would affect the credibility of the testimony of the complainant or the case set up by him in evidence would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. If the accused has raised a probable plea regarding the possession of his cheque with the complainant and when the accused has adduced reliable evidence to prove his plea in that regard, then absence of details regarding the original transaction in the complaint may be a circumstance which enables the accused to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. In a case where the accused could not even raise a probable plea as to how his cheque, which bears his signature, happened to be in the possession of the complainant, and the evidence, if any, adduced by the accused in support of any plea raised, is not reliable and trustworthy, absence of details regarding the original transaction in the complaint will not affect the credibility of the evidence given by the complainant in that regard.23. The courts below have properly analysed and appreciated the evidence in the case and reached the correct conclusion regarding the issuance of the cheques by the accused to the complainant and the inability of the accused to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. I find no illegality, impropriety or perversity in the appreciation of evidence and the findings entered by the courts below. In such circumstances, conviction of the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act is only to be confirmed.24. Coming to the question of sentence, it is to be noted that the gravity of an offence under Section 138 of the Act cannot be equated with an offence under the Indian Penal Code or other criminal offences. An offence under Section 138 of the Act is almost in the nature of a civil wrong which has been given criminal overtones (See Kaushalya Devi Massand v. Roopkishore : AIR 2011 SC 2566). Substantive sentence of imprisonment shall not be imposed in such cases except in exceptional circumstances. At the same time, direction to pay compensation to the complainant by way of restitution in regard to the loss on account of dishonour of the cheque shall be made. It would mean not only the payment of the cheque amount but interest thereon at a reasonable rate. Petition partly allowed",

The revision petitioner is the accused in the case C.C.No.465/2015 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate (N.I.Act cases), Kozhikode. 3. The petitioner filed Crl.Appeal No.331/2017 before the Court of Session, Kozhikode challenging the order of conviction and the sentence passed against him by the trial court. 4. Aggrieved by the concurrent findings of guilty, conviction and sentence made against him by the courts below, the accused has filed this revision petition 5. Heard learned counsel for the revision petitioner. 6. The case of the complainant is as follows: The accused had borrowed Rs. 5,00,000/- from the complainant. In repayment of that amount, the accused issued a cheque dated 13.11.2012 for Rs. 5,00,000/- to the complainant.  When the complainant presented the cheque in the bank, it was dishonoured for the reason that there was no sufficient amount in the account of the accused. The complainant sent a lawyer notice to the accused demanding payment of the amount of the cheque. The accused received the notice. He sent a reply raising false contentions. He did not pay the amount of the cheque 7. During the trial of the case, the complainant got himself examined as PW1 and a witness was examined on his side as PW2. Exts.P1 to P7 documents were also marked on his side. No evidence was adduced by the accused. Ext.C1 was marked as court exhibit. . When examined as PW1, the complainant gave evidence that he and the accused were close friends. He gave evidence that the accused used to borrow money from him. He stated that, on 6.5.2012, the accused borrowed an amount of Rs. 5,00,000/- from him. PW1 would say that his friend Nishad was then present. PW1 also gave evidence that, on demand made for repayment of the amount, the accused executed Ext.P1 cheque for Rs. 5,00,000/- and gave it to him. Nishad was examined as PW2 by the complainant to prove the transaction and also the issuing of the cheque by the accused. PW2 gave evidence that he saw the complainant giving Rs. 5,00,000/- to the accused. He also gave evidence that the accused issued Ext.P1 cheque to the complainant in his presence.  PW1 and PW2 have given evidence that the accused himself filled up the cheque and he signed it and gave it to PW1. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 would prove that the accused had borrowed Rs. 5,00,000/- from the complainant and the accused had executed and issued Ext.P1 cheque to the complainant in discharge of that liability.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 2. The trial court found the petitioner guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') and convicted him thereunder. The trial court sentenced the petitioner to pay a fine of Rs. 5,00,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of four months. The trial court also directed that, if the fine amount was realised, it shall be paid as compensation to the complainant. The appellate court confirmed the conviction as well as the sentence and dismissed the appeal. The trial court has dealt with this aspect in its judgment as follows:\\n\\n\"Learned counsel for accused submitted that the complainant has not produced any document to prove the source of money advanced to the accused. No question was put to PW1 about the source of money. No suggestion was put to PW1 in cross-examination denying his financial capacity to lend Rs. 5,00,000/- to the accused. PW1 stated that he is doing real estate business, and the amount available with him was paid to the accused. The burden of the complainant to prove the original transaction and source of money arise only when there are suspicious circumstances regarding the transaction and execution and issuance of cheque by the accused.\"\n**Argument by Petitioner**: . Learned counsel for the revision petitioner contended that the trial court should not have relied upon Ext.C1 report, without examining the expert, to find that the accused is the author of the entries in Ext.P1 cheque.  Even if this plea is accepted and if Ext.C1 report of the expert is eschewed from evidence, it would not in any manner enable the accused to prove his plea or to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. It was the plea of the accused that he was not the author of the entries in Ext.P1 cheque. It was at the instance of the accused that the cheque was sent for expert opinion. If the accused did not choose to examine the expert, as the report of the expert was not in his favour, it does not in any manner affects the credibility of the evidence of PW1 and PW2 that the accused himself wrote the entries in the cheque and signed it. Therefore, even if Ext.C1 report is eschewed from evidence, it can be found that the evidence of PW1 and PW2 is sufficient to prove that the cheque was executed by the accused and issued by him to the complainant.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  The plea of the accused was that the complainant is an advocate clerk and he had entrusted with the complainant signed blank cheques and stamp papers for the purpose of settlement of a case and that the complainant misused one of the cheques and filed the case. It was the plea of the accused that he is not the author of the entries in the cheque. . The cheque was sent for expert opinion at the instance of the accused to ascertain whether the entries in it had been made by him or not. The report of the handwriting expert was marked as Ext.C1 by the trial court without examining the expert.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  Once execution of the cheque by the accused is proved by the complainant, the presumption under Section 139 of the Act comes into play. The burden is upon the accused to rebut the presumption. No evidence was adduced by him to rebut the presumption. Nothing was also brought out in the cross examination of PW1 and PW2 which would enable the accused to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. It is also to be noted that the plea of the accused that he gave signed blank cheques to an advocate clerk for settlement of a case cannot be believed. Even if such a plea is accepted as probable, even then, the very fact that the accused did not take any steps against the complainant for misuse of the cheque, would indicate that the plea of the accused is not true. A plea was raised by the accused before the trial court that the complainant had no financial capacity to lend an amount of Rs. 5,00,000/-. This plea was raised only during the hearing of the case before the trial court. No question was put to PW1 regarding the source of money.  The financial capacity of the complainant was not challenged by the accused during the cross examination of the complainant. In such circumstances, the complainant had no obligation to prove his financial capacity or the sources of the money. The aforesaid view taken by the trial court cannot be found fault with. When the accused does not question the financial capacity of the complainant, there is no obligation on the complainant to prove it.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue in the case is whether the accused should be convicted for dishonor of a cheque under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The lower court found the accused guilty and sentenced him accordingly. \n\nThe accused's main defense is that the complainant, who is his neighbor, fraudulently obtained the signed blank cheques from his house and misused them. However, the complainant provided credible evidence that the accused borrowed a sum of Rs. 7,00,000/- from her and executed three cheques in discharge of this liability. The accused did not dispute the amount borrowed or the execution of the cheques.\n\nThe Indian Negotiable Instruments Act requires the following elements to establish a case under Section 138:\n1. The making of a cheque for payment of money to the payee or to an order.\n2. The cheque has been presented to the bank within a certain period.\n3. The cheque is returned unpaid.\n4. The payer has committed default in paying the amount of the cheque to the payee bank.\n5. The payee or the holder in due course of the cheque makes a demand for the payment of the amount of the cheque from the drawer of the cheque.\n6. The drawer of the cheque fails to make payment of the amount of the cheque to the payee bank within 15 days of the receipt of the notice.\n\nIn this case, all elements have been established by the complainant's evidence. The accused did not dispute the amount borrowed or the execution of the cheques. Therefore, the lower court's judgment is correct in convicting the accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\nThe only other point raised by the accused is that the complaint does not contain the details of the transactions between the petitioner and the complainant. However, this is a technical point and does not affect the validity of the case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\nIn conclusion, the appeal should be allowed, and the conviction of the accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act should be upheld. The lower court's judgment is correct in convicting the accused for dishonor of a cheque."

Aggrieved by the concurrent findings of guilty and conviction made against him by the courts below and the sentence imposed on him by the appellate court, the accused has filed this revision petition. 5. Heard the learned counsel for the revision petitioner and also the first respondent/complainant. 6. The case of the complainant is as follows: The accused had borrowed an amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- from the complainant. When the complainant demanded repayment of the amount, the accused came to the house of the complainant and issued a cheque for Rs. 2,00,000/- to him, in discharge of the liability.

When examined as PW1, the complainant gave evidence that the accused had borrowed Rs. 2,00,000/- from him and it was in discharge of that liability, the accused issued Ext.P1 cheque to him.  PW1 gave evidence that the accused had come to his house with a cheque which was filled up and that the accused signed the cheque in front of him and that the accused gave the cheque to him. Execution of Ext.P1 cheque by the accused stands proved by the evidence of PW1. Then, the burden is upon the accused to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n12. The complainant admitted that a property had been purchased in the name of his daughter-in-law and that the accused was a witness in the agreement executed at that time.  He denied the fact that the accused had given signed blank cheque as security at the time of the aforesaid transaction.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe plea of the accused was that he was a broker in the land transaction between the daughter-in-law of the complainant and a third party and on the date of signing the agreement in that transaction and when the advance amount was given, he gave a signed blank cheque as security for the advance amount.  It was the plea of the accused that the complainant misused the aforesaid cheque and filed the case. 11. In order to prove the aforesaid plea, the accused examined DW1, who was allegedly present at the time of the transaction between the daughter-in-law of the complainant and the third party. DW1 is also a broker.  He gave evidence in support of the plea of the accused that the accused had given a signed blank cheque as security in the aforesaid transaction. The plea of the accused that he gave a signed blank cheque as security for the amount of advance paid by the daughter-in-law of the complainant at the time of entering into an agreement for purchase of property from a third person is not at all believable.

The revision petitioner is the accused in the case C.C.No.465/2015 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate (N.I.Act cases), Kozhikode. 3. The petitioner filed Crl.Appeal No.331/2017 before the Court of Session, Kozhikode challenging the order of conviction and the sentence passed against him by the trial court. 4. Aggrieved by the concurrent findings of guilty, conviction and sentence made against him by the courts below, the accused has filed this revision petition 5. Heard learned counsel for the revision petitioner. 6. The case of the complainant is as follows: The accused had borrowed Rs. 5,00,000/- from the complainant. In repayment of that amount, the accused issued a cheque dated 13.11.2012 for Rs. 5,00,000/- to the complainant.  When the complainant presented the cheque in the bank, it was dishonoured for the reason that there was no sufficient amount in the account of the accused. The complainant sent a lawyer notice to the accused demanding payment of the amount of the cheque. The accused received the notice. He sent a reply raising false contentions. He did not pay the amount of the cheque 7. During the trial of the case, the complainant got himself examined as PW1 and a witness was examined on his side as PW2. Exts.P1 to P7 documents were also marked on his side. No evidence was adduced by the accused. Ext.C1 was marked as court exhibit. . When examined as PW1, the complainant gave evidence that he and the accused were close friends. He gave evidence that the accused used to borrow money from him. He stated that, on 6.5.2012, the accused borrowed an amount of Rs. 5,00,000/- from him. PW1 would say that his friend Nishad was then present. PW1 also gave evidence that, on demand made for repayment of the amount, the accused executed Ext.P1 cheque for Rs. 5,00,000/- and gave it to him. Nishad was examined as PW2 by the complainant to prove the transaction and also the issuing of the cheque by the accused. PW2 gave evidence that he saw the complainant giving Rs. 5,00,000/- to the accused. He also gave evidence that the accused issued Ext.P1 cheque to the complainant in his presence.  PW1 and PW2 have given evidence that the accused himself filled up the cheque and he signed it and gave it to PW1. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 would prove that the accused had borrowed Rs. 5,00,000/- from the complainant and the accused had executed and issued Ext.P1 cheque to the complainant in discharge of that liability.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 2. The trial court found the petitioner guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') and convicted him thereunder. The trial court sentenced the petitioner to pay a fine of Rs. 5,00,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of four months. The trial court also directed that, if the fine amount was realised, it shall be paid as compensation to the complainant. The appellate court confirmed the conviction as well as the sentence and dismissed the appeal. The trial court has dealt with this aspect in its judgment as follows:\\n\\n\"Learned counsel for accused submitted that the complainant has not produced any document to prove the source of money advanced to the accused. No question was put to PW1 about the source of money. No suggestion was put to PW1 in cross-examination denying his financial capacity to lend Rs. 5,00,000/- to the accused. PW1 stated that he is doing real estate business, and the amount available with him was paid to the accused. The burden of the complainant to prove the original transaction and source of money arise only when there are suspicious circumstances regarding the transaction and execution and issuance of cheque by the accused.\"\n**Argument by Petitioner**: . Learned counsel for the revision petitioner contended that the trial court should not have relied upon Ext.C1 report, without examining the expert, to find that the accused is the author of the entries in Ext.P1 cheque.  Even if this plea is accepted and if Ext.C1 report of the expert is eschewed from evidence, it would not in any manner enable the accused to prove his plea or to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. It was the plea of the accused that he was not the author of the entries in Ext.P1 cheque. It was at the instance of the accused that the cheque was sent for expert opinion. If the accused did not choose to examine the expert, as the report of the expert was not in his favour, it does not in any manner affects the credibility of the evidence of PW1 and PW2 that the accused himself wrote the entries in the cheque and signed it. Therefore, even if Ext.C1 report is eschewed from evidence, it can be found that the evidence of PW1 and PW2 is sufficient to prove that the cheque was executed by the accused and issued by him to the complainant.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  The plea of the accused was that the complainant is an advocate clerk and he had entrusted with the complainant signed blank cheques and stamp papers for the purpose of settlement of a case and that the complainant misused one of the cheques and filed the case. It was the plea of the accused that he is not the author of the entries in the cheque. . The cheque was sent for expert opinion at the instance of the accused to ascertain whether the entries in it had been made by him or not. The report of the handwriting expert was marked as Ext.C1 by the trial court without examining the expert.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  Once execution of the cheque by the accused is proved by the complainant, the presumption under Section 139 of the Act comes into play. The burden is upon the accused to rebut the presumption. No evidence was adduced by him to rebut the presumption. Nothing was also brought out in the cross examination of PW1 and PW2 which would enable the accused to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. It is also to be noted that the plea of the accused that he gave signed blank cheques to an advocate clerk for settlement of a case cannot be believed. Even if such a plea is accepted as probable, even then, the very fact that the accused did not take any steps against the complainant for misuse of the cheque, would indicate that the plea of the accused is not true. A plea was raised by the accused before the trial court that the complainant had no financial capacity to lend an amount of Rs. 5,00,000/-. This plea was raised only during the hearing of the case before the trial court. No question was put to PW1 regarding the source of money.  The financial capacity of the complainant was not challenged by the accused during the cross examination of the complainant. In such circumstances, the complainant had no obligation to prove his financial capacity or the sources of the money. The aforesaid view taken by the trial court cannot be found fault with. When the accused does not question the financial capacity of the complainant, there is no obligation on the complainant to prove it.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case revolves around the conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The lower court found the petitioner guilty and sentenced him to imprisonment and a fine. The appellate court confirmed the conviction but modified the sentence. The petitioner contends that he gave a signed blank cheque as security for an advance amount in a land transaction, and the complainant misused the cheque. \n\nThe petitioner's argument is not believable as a broker or real estate agent would not usually give a signed blank cheque as security for an advance amount. The lower court, however, failed to consider this aspect while evaluating the petitioner's defence. In this regard, the court should have looked into the general practice and the likelihood of a broker or real estate agent providing a signed blank cheque as security.\n\nGiven the weakness in the lower court's judgment, the appeal should be allowed. The conviction and sentence imposed on the petitioner are set aside. The petitioner is discharged from the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act."

C.C.No.595 of 2003 is a prosecution launched by the appellant herein before the trial court under Section 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'N I Act').  2. The case of the prosecution in brief are to the following effect:- A cheque dated 02.09.2001, drawn from State Bank of India, Varapetty Branch for a sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- was issued by the accused to the complainant for discharging a previous debt. The cheque was presented at State Bank of India, Ayavana Branch for collection. It was dishonoured for insufficiency funds in the account of the accused. A lawyer notice was issued by the complainant on 12.09.2001 demanding the money covered by the cheque. The notice issued, though accepted by the accused on 29.09.2001, he failed to pay the amount. Thereupon a complaint was filed to launch the prosecution under Section 142 N I Act. On appearance of the accused, after furnishing him with the copies of the relevant records, particulars of the accusations raised in the complaint were read over and explained to him. He pleaded not guilty. Accordingly, trial was held. On the side of the prosecution, the complainant himself was examined as PW1 and Exts.P1 to P5 were marked. On closure of the prosecution evidence, the accused was questioned with reference to the incriminating evidences brought on record by the complainant under Section 313 (1)(b) Cr.P.C. He denied all the allegations and maintained the stand of innocence. 4. The trial court has raised the following points for consideration in the case on hand:-\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nAccording to the learned counsel, the trial court failed to appreciate the evidence in it's proper perspective, but jumped into a conclusion that the presumption under Section 139 N I Act is attracted in the case on hand and the accused succeeded in rebutting that presumption. According to him, the judgment under challenge is liable to be interfered with, for that reason. 6. It has come out in evidence of complainant as PW1 that he had a plan to start an Ayurvedic Resort Centre at Munnar and the accused agreed to join the venture by providing land support. Lateron, he realised that the accused has no landed property in his name and therefore he receded from the plan. According to him, Rs. 1,00,000/- was given by him to the accused as part of the venture without security and though the plan failed, Rs. 1,00,000/- given was not returned by the accused. According to PW1, the accused issued a cheque towards repayment at his residence. It was presented at the Band and dishonoured for want of sufficient funds and therefore, the prosecution was launched.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nAccording to the accused an agreement was executed following the proposal to start the Ayurvedic Resort. According to him the disputed cheque was given by him to meet the initial expenditure to be incurred for the proposed plan.  According to him, on realisation that the complainant did not possess the required qualification, he retreated from the proposed plan and the cheque given by him to the complainant was not returned. The accused put the above case as suggestion to the complainant during his examination as PW1 but he denied the same.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe trial court found after appreciation of the evidence on record that the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption and accordingly acquitted him. Against the finding of acquittal, the complainant is now in appeal before this Court.\n",
    "Case_Result": "The accused examined a witness on his side as DW1. According to DW1 he had also a desire to join the proposed plan. According to him, he was introduced into the proposed project by the complainant as an Ayurvedic Doctor. According to him, an agreement was executed in that regard between him and the complainant.To derive money to meet the initial expenditure towards the project they decided to have the participation of the accused also in the venture. Thus, the accused issued a cheque and the said cheque is the disputed one in the case in question. According to DW1, lateron it was realised that the complainant does not have the required qualification for the conduct of the Ayurvedic Resort as stated by him and accordingly himself and the accused retreated therefrom. DW1 during cross examination has stated that Rs. 1,00,000/- was given to the complainant at Kaveri Tourist Home, Kothamangalam whereas the version of PW1 was that the cheque for Rs. 1,00,000/- was given to the complainant at his house.

Bharath Kumar, for respondent are present. . With the consent of the learned counsel appearing for the parties, matter is taken up for final disposal. The petition is presented under Section 397 read with Section 401 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 against the Judgment dated 02.02.2015 passed by the Presiding Officer, Fast Track Court-XV, Bangalore, in Criminal Appeal No.294/2012 wherein the appeal came to be dismissed, thereby the Judgment passed by the trial Court came to be confirmed. In order to avoid confusion and overlapping, the parties are referred to in accordance with the rankings held by them in the trial Court. . The substance of the complaint is that the accused approached the complainant for financial assistance in the form of hand loan during the month of November - 2007 for Rs. 5,75,000/- for his urgent business purpose and the complainant advanced the same to the accused on 21.11.2007. The amount was lent in the form of cash. Accused agreed to repay the amount within two years, but he committed default, however, he issued a Cheque bearing No.763105 dated 03.04.2010 for a sum of Rs. 5,75,000/- drawn on ABN AMRO Bank, Prestige Towers, Residency Road, Bangalore. On presentation of the said Cheque for encashment by the complainant in his collecting banker - Bank of India, the said Cheque was dishonored and returned on 05.04.2010 with an endorsement as \"Account Closed\".  The complainant issued a legal notice on 27.04.2010. In spite of legal notice got issued, neither the amount was repaid nor the terms of the notice were complied. Accordingly, a criminal case came to be presented against the accused on 21.05.2010. . After taking cognizance of the offence, on summons accused appeared and pleaded not guilty and came to be tried the complainant adduced the evidence as PW1 and got marked the documents Exs.P1 to P7. On behalf of accused, the accused was examined as DW1 and an Electricity Bill was marked as Ex.D1. 9. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, accused preferred an appeal in Crl.A.

Aggrieved by it, the present revision is preferred by the accused.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 8.

He would further submit that the de novo trial should have been the substance of the case and it is no where applicable for a subsequent Magistrate to rely on the evidence on record. In this regard, he relied on Section 262 of Cr.P.C., and the decisions of Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:  Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner-accused submitted that the case falls on another material lapse, whereas the accused is not examined under Section 313 of Cr.P.C.,\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Learned counsel for the complainant refuting the stand taken by the petitioner, would submit that a legally enforceable debt was existed. Accused issued a Cheque that came to be dishonored. In the circumstances, there is presence of all the ingredients for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act (for short 'N.I. Act') and the legal objections raised by the counsel for the petitioner is not tenable.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  In the context and circumstances of the case, basically there is a complaint for the offence under Section 138 of N.I. Act, which came to be filed against the petitioner. The Cheque bearing No.763105 dated 03.04.2010 for Rs. 5,75,000/- issued by the petitioner was presented to the Bank by the complainant for payment and it came to be dishonored and the legal notice was issued by the complainant to the petitioner. As the accused neither replied nor repaid the Cheque amount within stipulated time, a criminal case was instituted. Evidence was adduced by the complainant and the accused as stated above.  Ultimately the accused came to be convicted by the trial Judge, which came to confirmed by the appellate Court by dismissing the appeal filed by the accused/petitioner. The contention of the petitioner/accused earlier has been that he has obtained a LIC policy and he had issued a Cheque. However, no details of policy amount, premium amount and even duration are mentioned. As such it appears that such a defence is taken for the sake of defence without there being any substance in it.  Before this Court, the learned counsel for the accused/petitioner submits that the evidence was recorded by the Magistrate in the trial Court and the judgment was pronounced and the appreciation was by the Successor Magistrate. As such the enquiry is vitiated. He relied upon Sections 362 and 326 of Cr.P.C. He would further stress that under Section 461 of Cr.P.C., the proceedings are vitiated as there is material irregularity. He also relied upon the citations referred supra and submitted the case falls on material lapse that the accused was not examined under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. I find the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner/accused has no legal force in it.  Further insofar as the contention of the petitioner/accused that the Magistrate has not examined the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C., is concerned, the examination of the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. is an important stage in criminal proceedings and non-examination definitely would imply either there are no incriminating scircumstances against the accused or it is left as lapse.\n",

The petitioner and the first respondent shall be hereinafter referred to as the complainant and the accused for the sake of convenience. he case of the complainant is as follows: The accused and his wife borrowed an amount of Rs. 12,00,000/- from the complainant promising that they would repay the amount as and when demanded. When the complainant demanded the amount, the accused issued a cheque dated 02.02.2009 for Rs. 12,00,000/- in favour of the complainant, in discharge of the liability.  The complainant presented the cheque in the bank. It was returned unpaid for the reason that there was no sufficient amount in the account of the accused. The complainant sent a lawyer notice to the accused demanding payment of the amount of the cheque. The accused received the notice. He did not pay the amount of the cheque. During the trial of the case, the complainant got himself examined as PW1 and two other witnesses were also examined on his side as PW2 and PW3. Exts.P1 to P6 documents were also marked on his side. DW1 was examined on the side of the accused and Ext.D1 series documents were marked on his side. Ext.X1 series documents were also marked in the case. The accused filed Crl.A.No.272/2013 before the Court of Session, Kottayam challenging the order of conviction and sentence passed against him by the trial court. . As per the order dated 04.07.2018, the appellate court allowed the appeal filed by the accused and remanded the case to the trial court with a direction to take fresh evidence and dispose of the case in accordance with law. It is pertinent here to note that, during the pendency of the appeal, an application was filed by the accused for sending the cheque for expert opinion. The aforesaid application was allowed by the appellate court and the cheque was sent for expert opinion. The report of the expert was received by the appellate court. Thereafter, the accused filed an application before the appellate court for issuing summons to the expert for examining him as a witness. The complainant challenged the judgment dated 04.07.2018 of the appellate court by filing Crl.R.P.No.1278/2018 before this Court. During the hearing of the aforesaid revision petition, it was submitted before this Court that the judgment of the appellate court was rendered without hearing the counsel for both parties. Taking into consideration the aforesaid submissions made by the counsel on both sides, this Court set aside the judgment dated 04.07.2018 of the appellate court with a direction to that court to dispose of the appeal in accordance with law after affording a reasonable opportunity to both parties of being heard. 10. After the remand of the appeal, the appellate court again considered the appeal The judgment dated 12.03.2019 passed by the appellate court in Crl.A.No.272/2013 is challenged by the complainant in this revision petition.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: After appreciating the evidence adduced by the parties, the trial court found the accused guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') and convicted him thereunder.  The trial court sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months and also directed him to pay an amount of Rs. 12,00,000/- as compensation to the complainant and in default of payment of compensation, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of sixty days The learned Additional Sessions Judge, as per the judgment dated 12.03.2019, allowed the appeal and again remanded the case to the trial court for taking fresh evidence and for disposal in accordance with law.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the revision petitioner contended that the learned Additional Sessions Judge has disposed of the appeal for the second time practically rendering the same judgment which was rendered on the first occasion. Learned counsel for the revision petitioner also contended that there was no necessity to adduce fresh evidence in the case and if at all the appellate court was of the view that additional evidence was required, it was not necessary to remand the case to the trial court.  Learned counsel for the revision petitioner further contended that the appellate court omitted to take into consideration the fact that the suit filed by the complainant for realisation of money on the basis of the cheque was decreed by the trial court and the challenge against the decree passed against him was taken by the accused upto the Hon'ble Supreme Court but without any success.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Per contra, learned counsel for the first respondent contended that the report of the expert was before the appellate court and the accused had filed application for examination of the expert and therefore, the appellate court was justified in remanding the case to the trial court for taking fresh evidence.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 13. Heard learned counsel for the revision petitioner/complainant and also the first respondent/accused. . Section 391 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Code') states that in dealing with any appeal, the Appellate Court, if it thinks additional evidence to be necessary, shall record its reasons and may either take such evidence itself, or direct it to be taken by a Magistrate, or when the Appellate Court is a High Court, by a Court of Session or a Magistrate. Additional evidence may be necessary for a variety of reasons. It may, however, be said that additional evidence must be necessary not because it would be impossible to pronounce judgment in appeal but because there would be failure of justice without it.  The power must be exercised sparingly and only in suitable cases. Once such action is justified, there is no restriction on the kind of evidence which may be received. It may be formal or substantial (See Rajeswar Prasad Misra v. State of West Bengal : AIR 1965 SC 1887). The object of Section 391 of the Code is not to fill in lacuna, but to subserve the ends of justice. Admission of additional evidence should not operate in a manner prejudicial to the prosecution or the defence. Though wide discretion is conferred on the Court, the same has to be exercised judicially and after recording of reasons.  Recording of reasons is a condition precedent for exercise of power under Section 391 of the Code (See Rambhau v. State of Maharashtra : AIR 2001 SC 2120). The word \"necessary\" used in Section 391(1) of the Code is to mean necessary for deciding the appeal. Power to take additional evidence under Section 391 of the Code is, thus, with an object to appropriately decide the appeal by the Appellate Court to secure ends of justice. There are no fetters on the power under Section 391 of the Code (See Sukhjeet Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh : 2019 (2) SCALE 104). A bare reading of the provision contained in Section 391 of the Code makes it clear that the section invests the appellate court with the power to record additional evidence, provided it is satisfied, for the reasons to be recorded, that additional evidence in the matter is necessary. Since Section 391 of the Code is an exception to the general rule that an appeal should be decided on the evidence which was before the trial court, power under the section has to be exercised with caution and circumspection so as to meet the ends of justice and not as a matter of course. In the instant case, the appellate court had sent the cheque for expert opinion. The report of the expert was received in the appellate court. The accused filed application before the appellate court for examination of the expert.  If the appellate court was of the view that it was absolutely necessary to examine the expert for admitting in evidence his report, it could have examined the expert in that court itself. Merely for that purpose, it was not necessary to remand the entire case to the trial court with a direction for taking fresh evidence in the case and dispose of the case afresh. The impugned judgment of the appellate court does not reveal, except the report of the expert, any other additional evidence had to be adduced in the case by the parties. The appellate court has also not recorded any reasons for allowing additional evidence, other than the expert report, to be adduced in the case at the appellate stage. As noticed earlier, the power under Section 391(1) of the Code shall not be exercised as a matter of routine.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue of the case is whether the accused is guilty of an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, for dishonour of a cheque. The lower court found the accused guilty and sentenced him accordingly. The accused contends that the complainant misused one of the cheques and filed the case.\n\nThe lower court erred in relying on Ext.C1 report, without examining the expert, to find that the accused is the author of the entries in Ext.P1 cheque. Even if this plea is accepted and if Ext.C1 report of the expert is eschewed from evidence, it would not in any manner enable the accused to prove his plea or to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of the Act. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 is sufficient to prove that the cheque was executed by the accused and issued by him to the complainant. Therefore, the appeal should be dismissed.\n\n**DISMISSED**"

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. This appeal, by special leave, is preferred by the appellant-complainant against the judgment and order dated 30.11.2018, passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Almora in Complaint Case No.01 of 2018, \"Ramesh Nagarkoti vs. Kedar Datt Purohit\", whereby the learned trial court acquitted the respondent-accused from the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short \"the Act, 1881\"). 2. As per the averments made in the complaint, the complainant and the accused were businessmen and the complainant had good relations with the accused, who was the proprietor of \"Purohit Agency.\" The accused made a request to the complainant that he was in need of money for his business work and for purchasing a house. He assured the complainant to return the amount as early as possible. Due to the relationship, the complainant deposited time to time Rs.19,45,000.00/- through NEFT/RTGS in the account of the accused's proprietorship firm \"Purohit Agency\" and Rs.55,000.00/- through cash payment on credit. In the said deposited amount, a sum of Rs.1,90,000/- was deposited by the complainant through Gopal Singh (PW-2).  The complainant gave a sum of total Rs.20,00,000.00/- to the respondent on credit. The complainant demanded his money. Then, the accused issued a cheque No.797972 dated 16.10.2017 payable on Indian Bank, Almora for the sum of Rs.20,00,000.00/- in regard to the credit amount given to the accused. The said cheque was deposited by the complainant in his account. The said cheque was dishonoured by the bank of the accused with note of \"exceed agreement\". The complainant acknowledged the dishonoured cheque on 02.11.2017 and a legal notice was sent to the accused on 09.11.2017, which was served upon the accused on 17.11.2017. A reply was given by the accused on false and misconceived facts. Since no payment was forthcoming pursuant to the said demand notice, a complaint case was filed by the complainant against the accused under Section 138 of the Act, 1881. The respondent-accused appeared before the learned trial court. Substance of accusation was recorded by the learned trial court, wherein the respondent- accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 4. The complainant in order to prove his case got himself examined as PW1 and examined Gopal Singh (PW2). 5. The complainant filed Cheque-in-question No.797972 dated 16.10.2017 of Rs.20,00,000.00/-. Return Memo, copy of Registered Notice, Receipt, Acknowledgment, Reply of the accused and Statement of Bank Account.\\n\\n6. The witness Gopal Singh (PW-2), a relative of the complainant, stated that the accused demanded money from the complainant. Then, on the request of the complainant, he deposited Rs.1,90,000/- in the account of the accused through Cheque No. 910747 dated 02.02.2017.\\n\\n7. Statement of the accused was recorded under Section 313 of the Code. The accused examined Govind Ballabh Purohit (DW1) and Mohan Prasad Purohit (DW2). The witness Govind Ballabh Purohit (DW1) and the witness Mohan Prasad Purohit (DW2) are brothers of the accused. Govind Ballabh Purohit (DW1) stated that he was a partner of the \"Purohit Agency\" and the witness Mohan Prasad Purohit (DW2) stated that he was the main Director of the \"Purohit Agency\". He further stated that there was no commercial relationship between the complainant and the accused. According to this witness, the commercial relationship was between him and the complainant. e. The accused examined Govind Ballabh Purohit (DW1) and Mohan Prasad Purohit (DW2).\\n\\n8. The witness Govind Ballabh Purohit (DW1) and the witness Mohan Prasad Purohit (DW2) are brothers of the accused. Govind Ballabh Purohit (DW1) stated that he was a partner of the \"Purohit Agency\" and the witness Mohan Prasad Purohit (DW2) stated that he was the main Director of the \"Purohit Agency\". He further stated that there was no commercial relationship between the complainant and the accused. According to this witness, the commercial relationship was between him and the complainant.\\n\\n9. The accused filed copies of the statement of the bank account of Govind Ballabh Purohit of Punjab National Bank, C.D., and copies of pass-book of Mohan Prasad Purohit of Indian Bank, Almora and Punjab National Bank, Dharanaula, Almora. 10. The accused submitted his written arguments. 12. Challenging the judgment of acquittal, the complainant has filed this criminal appeal after obtaining special leave.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n14. Mr. Sanjay Kumar, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the \"Purohit Agency\" was being run in the proprietorship of the respondent and the Cheque-in- question was issued by the respondent putting his signature with a seal of the \"Purohit Agency\" as a proprietor; the said cheque was given to the appellant to present in the bank; after acknowledged the dishonoured cheque on 02.11.2017, a demand notice was sent to the respondent on 09.11.2017, which was served upon the respondent on 17.11.2017; the reply was given by the respondent on false and misconceived facts; the amount of the cheque was not paid; the learned trial court committed wrong in holding that there was no legal debt or liability; the settled proposition of law is that no one should be left remediless; the learned trial court acquitted the respondent on the technical ground that without the firm being arraigned as an accused, the accused would not be liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Act, 1881; the appellant-complainant should have been directed to amend his complaint; therefore, the learned trial court has miserably failed to appreciate the oral and documentary evidence on record in a proper and perspective manner. After completion the arguments, the learned counsel for the appellant furnished a decision rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rangappa vs. Sri Mohan, (2010) 11 SCC 441. 27. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that proprietorship is a business form where there is only one owner and there is no legal difference between the business and the owner and in the present case, the firm was running by one single person, i.e. the respondent- accused. His liability was unlimited and there was no legal distinction between the owner and the business. 29. In reply, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the settled proposition of law is that no one should be left remediless but the decision of the learned trial court acquitting the accused on the technical ground that in absence of the firm being arraigned as an accused, the accused would not be liable, is not sustainable in the eyes of law because the complainant has been left remediless. The learned counsel for the appellant further submitted that the complainant should have been directed to amend his complaint but the learned trial court arbitrarily acquitted the accused. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that this plea has also been taken specifically on the ground of appeal. In light of these arguments, however, the learned counsel for the appellant admitted the fact that the \"Purohit Agency\" was a partnership firm even though his submission is that the complaint cannot be dismissed on this technical ground.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n. On the other hand, Mr. Yogesh Kumar Pacholia, learned counsel for the respondent, argued in support of the impugned judgment and submitted that the appellant- complainant could not establish his case that the disputed cheque was issued by the respondent-accused in discharge of any legally enforceable debt or liability; it is admitted fact that the \"Purohit Agency\" was not being run in the proprietorship of the respondent; the \"Purohit Agency\" was a partnership firm; the witness Govind Ballabh Purohit (DW1) and the witness Mohan Prasad Purohit (DW2), brothers of the respondent, were partner of the \"Purohit Agency\", therefore, without the said firm being arraigned as an accused, the respondent-accused would not be liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Act, 1881.  The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that although, the sole proprietary concern is not a legal entity apart from the sole proprietor, therefore, there is no need to make the sole proprietary concern a party in the complaint, filed under Section 138 of the Act, 1881, but, in the instant case, the respondent-accused was not the sole proprietor of the \"Purohit Agency\" and the \"Purohit Agency\" was not sole proprietary concern. The learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that the \"Purohit Agency\" was a partnership firm. He further submitted that the witness Govind Ballabh Purohit (DW1), brother of the respondent, clearly stated in his examination-in-chief that he was a partner of the \"Purohit Agency\" and the witness Mohan Prasad Purohit (DW2), brother of the respondent- accused, stated in his examination-in-chief that the firm of this witness was known as the \"Purohit Agency\" and he was the main Director of the \"Purohit Agency\". The learned counsel for the respondent argued that these statements of the witness Govind Ballabh Purohit (DW1) and Mohan Prasad Purohit (DW2) have not been challenged by the complainant in the cross-examination of these two witnesses. The learned counsel for the respondent further submitted that the complainant Ramesh Nagarkoti (PW1) has admitted in his cross-examination that the cheque-in- question belonged to the firm and the said cheque was given to him as a firm. The complainant further stated in his cross- examination that he did not know about the partners of the firm. The learned counsel for the respondent contended that in absence of partnership firm being arraigned as an accused, prosecution of a partner of the firm for the cheque bounce under Section 138 of the Act, 1881 is not maintainable.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n3. The learned trial court took cognizable on the complaint. The process under Section 204 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Code\") was issued. 1. The learned trial court on hearing both the sides has recorded judgment of acquittal. The learned trial court did not draw presumption under Section 139 of the Act, 1881 and in view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Aneeta Hada vs. Godfather Travels and Tours Pvt. Ltd., (2012) 5 SCC 661 : (AIR 2012 SC 2795), held that without the firm being arraigned as an accused, the accused would not be liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Act, 1881.\n",
    "Case_Result": "13. Heard learned counsel for both the parties and perused the record.17. Section 138 of the Act, 1881 defines the ingredients of the offence. The following ingredients are required to be satisfied for making out a case under Section 138 of the Act, 1881: (i) that a person must have drawn a cheque on an account maintained by him in a bank for payment of a certain amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge of any legally enforceable debt or other liability; (ii) that cheque has been presented to the bank within a period of six months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity, whichever is earlier; (iii) that cheque is returned by the bank unpaid, either because the amount of money standing to the credit of the account is insufficient to honour the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with the bank; (iv) the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within thirty days of the receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid; (v) the drawer of such cheque fails to make payment of the said amount of money to the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque within 15 days of the receipt of the said notice.18. By the nature of the offence under Section 138 of the Act, 1881, the first ingredient constituting the offence is the fact that the accused drew a cheque and the second crucial question to determine applicability of Section 138 of the Act, 1881 is whether the cheque represents discharge of any legally enforceable debt or liability.22. Before the learned trial court, the appellant- complainant was cross examined by the defence. In the cross-examination, defence denied accused's signature on the cheque. In the cross- examination of the complainant, the defence was that there was no transaction between the complainant and the accused and all the transactions of the complainant were with his brother Mohan Prasad Purohit and in the absence of his brother Mohan Prasad Purohit, the complainant had taken seven cheques from the shop of his brother. With respect to the cheque-in-question, which was dishonoured, the defence was that the said cheque was amongst the seven cheques, which was misused by the complainant.23. Under Section 139 of the Act, 1881, once a cheque has been signed and issued in favour of the holder, there is statutory presumption that it is issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability. However, this presumption is a rebuttable one. If the accused will able to raise a probable defence which creates doubts about the existence of a legally enforceable debt or liability, the prosecution can fail. Onus is upon the accused to rebut the presumption and to establish that the cheque in question was not given in respect of any debt or liability, however, for which it is not necessary for the accused to disprove the existence of consideration by way of direct evidence, even the evidence adduced on behalf of the complainant can be relied upon.25. The respondent-accused denied his signature on the cheque. The accused has not led any evidence in support of this plea. The accused even did not come in the witness box to support his case. In the reply to the notice of the appellant-complainant, it was not mentioned that there was no transaction between the complainant and the accused and all the transactions of the complainant were with his brother Mohan Prasad Purohit. There was no case in the reply of the accused that the complainant had taken seven cheques from the shop of his brother and the cheque-in- question was amongst the seven cheques, which was misused by the complainant. The statement of the accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not a substantive evidence of defence of the accused but only an opportunity to the accused to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing in the prosecution case. Mere statement of the accused may not be sufficient to rebut the presumption. Therefore, this Court does not see any basis in the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent that the respondent-accused has been successful in creating doubt in the mind of the Court with regard to the existence of the legally enforceable debt or liability.26. Before the learned trial court, the case of the respondent-accused was that under Section 141 of the Act, 1881, unless and until the firm is arrayed as an accused, no vicarious liability can be fastened on its partner.30. Section 141 of the Act, 1881 stipulates the liability for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act, 1881 when the person committing such an offence happens to be a company i.e. when the drawer of the cheque happens to be a company. For the purpose of Section 141 of the Act, 1881, a firm comes within the ambit of a company.33. In the ratio of the aforesaid judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it is clear that if the cheque had been issued by the firm which was subsequently dishonoured, a partner of the firm would not be liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Act, 1881 without the firm being arraigned as an accused. In the present complaint, filed by the appellant-complainant before the learned trial court, the firm is not arraigned as an accused. Appeal dismissed",

Focus on the logical flow leading to your final decision, avoiding unnecessary repetition of facts.\n3. Clearly state whether the appeal should be allowed or dismissed, with a brief justification that directly ties back to your analysis.\n\nThe main issue in this case is whether the respondent-accused, Kedar Datt Purohit, is liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, for issuing a dishonoured cheque in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability. The lower court acquitted the respondent on the technical ground that without the firm being arraigned as an accused, the accused would not be liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Act.\n\nThe complainant, Ramesh Nagarkoti, alleged that the respondent, as the proprietor of the \"Purohit Agency,\" made a request for money, which he deposited in the accused's account. The complainant further deposited a sum of Rs.20,00,000 through a cheque, which was dishonoured by the bank. A legal notice was sent to the respondent, and since no payment was forthcoming, a complaint was filed under Section 138 of the Act, 1881.\n\nThe respondent contended that the \"Purohit Agency\" was a partnership firm, and without the said firm being arraigned as an accused, the respondent would not be liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Act, 1881.

The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 does not make a distinction between a sole proprietor and a partner in a firm. Both are equally liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Act for issuing a dishonoured cheque in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability. The fact that the \"Purohit Agency\" was a partnership firm does not exempt the respondent from liability under Section 138 of the Act.\n\nIn light of the above analysis, the appeal should be allowed, and the judgment of the lower court acquitting the respondent should be set aside. The respondent is liable for prosecution under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, for issuing a dishonoured cheque in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability."

The petitioner then borrowed Rs.50,000/- from Sri Swapan Pal (PW-2) and Rs.80,000/- from his friend Sri Sajal Laskar and gave the entire sum of Rs.1,30,000/- as loan to the respondent. Despite lapse of the assured period of six months, the respondent did not repay the loan to the petitioner.  As a result of constant persuasion of the petitioner, the respondent ultimately issued a cheque in his name bearing No. MPS/M 028821 dated 22.05.2009 for a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- drawn on UBI, G.B Hospital extension counter at Agartala against her Savings Bank Account No.1449 towards repayment of the loan. The petitioner presented the said cheque for encashment in UCO Bank, High Court extension branch where he maintained Savings Bank Account No.4485. The cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of fund in the said account of the respondent and the fact was informed to the petitioner from his bank vide cheque returning memo dated 27.05.2009 (Exbt.3). [4] The petitioner then issued statutory demand notice dated 01.06.2009 (Exbt.4) to the respondent in terms of Section 138 of the N.I. Act demanding repayment of the said amount. The respondent having failed to make the payment within the notice period, the petitioner filed a complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, West Tripura at Agartala. [5] The case was then made over to the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class (Court No.5) at Agartala for trial. The bench clerk was directed by the trial Court to report about the veracity of the claim of the complainant with regard to filing of the original cheque in Court. Thereafter the Court did not proceed further with this issue  At the commencement of trial, the accusation against the accused respondent was explained to her in terms of Section 251 Cr.P.C which reads as under: \"The substance of accusation is that you, Smt. Sumana Saha on 30.10.2007 took loan of Rs.1,30,000/- from the complt., Rinku Debnath @ Basu and on demand, in response to the return of the loan amount, on 22.5.09 you issued a cheque being No.028821 for Rs.1,30,000/- drawn on UBI, Agartala, G.B Extension Br. in favour of the complt. On 25.5.2009 complt. submitted the said cheque before his banker, U.Co. Bank, High Court Br. for encashment but on 27.5.2009 the said bank informed him by issuing a return memo that the cheque was dishonoured due to insufficient fund and inspite of receiving the demand notice you did not make any payment of Rs.1,30,000/- within the stipulated period, as such you violated the provision of Sec.138 of N.I. Act.\" Accused respondent pleaded not guilty and claimed a trial During trial, complainant examined himself as PW-1 and one Sri Swapan Paul as PW-2. The trial Court also summoned the Branch Manager of UCO Bank, High Court Branch in exercise of power under Section 311, Cr.P.C and examined the witnesse as Court Witness(CW) No.1. Similarly, the trial Court summoned the Branch Manager of UBI, G. B. P Hospital extension branch and examined him as Court Witness(CW) No.2. After the recording of the prosecution evidence and examination of the Court witnesses was over, the trial Court examined the accused respondent under Section 313 Cr. P.C and recorded her statement. She pleaded innocence and claimed that the charge was foisted on her. She also desired to adduce evidence on her behalf. Accordingly, the accused examined two witnesses including herself. She examined herself as DW-1 and one Sanjib Roy, an advocate's clerk as DW-2. Hence, the aggrieved complainant has filed this criminal revision petition challenging the impugned judgment of the appellate Court One of the most essential things which is required to be seen in a case under Section 138 of the N.I Act is whether the cheque represents discharge of existing enforceable debt or liability or whether it reflects advance payment without there being a subsisting debt or liability. In the given context, complainant PW-1 stated in his examination in chief that in the month of October in 2007, his colleague Smt. Sumana Saha, accused, approached him for a loan for purchasing a Maruti car for commercial use. On her assurance that she would return the money within six months, PW-1 gave her Rs.1,30,000/- by borrowing the money from two of his friends namely, Sri Swapan Pal and Sri Sajal Laskar. The said sum of money was paid by him to the accused on 30.10.2007 in presence of said Swapan pal and Sajal Laskar when the accused assured him that she would return the money within six months After lot of persuasion, the accused issued cheque No. MPS/M/No.028821 dated 22.05.2009 drawn on UBI, G.B Hospital extension counter for a sum of Rs.1,30,000/-. PW-1 presented the said cheque for encashment in UCO Bank, High Court Branch where he maintained savings bank account No. 4485 in his name. According to him he presented the cheque on 25.5.2009. On 27.5.2009 the cheque was returned by his banker with a return memo (Exbt.3) for insufficiency of funds in the account of the accused. Initially he asked the accused to make the payment. Seeing her reluctant in making the payment, he served statutory demand notice on the accused within 15 days. The notice was returned unserved with a report that the addressee was not found in the given address. The PW then approached the Court by filing a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  In the cross examination of the witness, there is no denial of payment of said loan to the accused by the complainant. it would be appropriate to reproduce the cross examination of PW-1 which is as under : \"The accused is an advocate's clerk and used to work with me. I gave loan to the accused for Rs.1,30,000/-. I gave the money after collecting it from Swapan Paul and Sajal Laskar. I have given the money in full amount at a time in presence of Swapan and Sajal in cash and a money receipt was issued in my name only. I have not given any receipt to Swapan and Sajal for taking money from them. I deposited the cheque on 25.05.09 and on 27.05.09 I was informed about dishonour of cheque. I gave advocate notice on 01.06.09. The demand notice was not received by the accused and the notice was returned but I do not remember the date of return. I have after refusal of notice given the address of the accused to post office, I have not submitted any copy to show that I submitted it to the post office. It is not a fact that I wilfully sent the demand notice to wrong address. It is not a fact that accused repaied me the loan of Rs.1,30,000/- or I tore the original cheque intentionally and submitted a photocopy of the same before the court or for this reason I filed the complaint petition after the statutory period. It is not true that I am not entitle to get any money from the accused.\"  Said Swapan Pal, PW-1 from whom complainant PW-1 borrowed Rs.50,000/- for giving the loan to the accused also deposed at the trial as PW-2. In his examination in Chief, the PW stated that pursuant to the request of the PW-1 he gave him Rs.50,000/- to him to give the loan to the accused. The complainant borrowed more Rs.80,000/- from Sajal Laskar and gave a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- to the accused as loan in his presence. PW-2 further stated that the accused assured repayment of the loan within six months. When she did not return the loan within the period assured by her, the PW accompanied the complaint to her house at 79 tilla within jurisdiction of East Agartala police station when the accused stated to them that she did not have any cash at that moment. Therefore, she issued the said cheque of a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- to the complainant which was later dishonoured for insufficiency of fund in her account. In his cross examination, the PW-2 made the following statement: \"I do not have any licence for money lending. I gave money to Rinku Debnath on 30.10.07 but I did not obtain any money receipt from him. I do not know the accused Rinku took money from me to give money to Sumana saha when the money was taken I did not know Sumana Saha. I have not never personally asked the accused to return the money. I do not know how Sumana was supposed to return the money. I do not know whether accused paid back the loan to Rinku or not.\"  Smt. Sumana Saha who is the accused gave statement as DW-1. In her examination-in- chief on affidavit she admitted that she worked as an advocate's clerk and she was acquainted with the complainant who was also a clerk of another advocate. She further stated that in 2004 she purchased a Maruti Car by taking loan from a non banking financial institution and due to non payment of loan in time, her vehicle was confiscated by the loan giver. She had then taken a loan of a sum of Rs.50,000/- from the complainant on condition that she would pay Rs.5000/- per month for 16 months to the complainant for which she gave signed blank cheque and stamp papers to the complainant on condition that those documents would be returned to her after repayment of the loan. Thereafter, she paid Rs.80,000/- to the complainant by paying monthly instalments of Rs.5000/- for 16 months though she had taken a loan of Rs.50,000/- only. Despite repayment of loan, the complaint did not return the cheque and stamp papers to her. The matter was later settled between them and the said blank cheque and stamp papers were destroyed by the complainant in her presence. Subsequently, she received a notice from Court and came to know that complainant filed a case against her for realisation of Rs.1,30,000/-. According to the DW she had never taken such loan from complainant. She stuck to her version that she had taken a loan of Rs.50,000/- only from the complaint for which she paid him Rs.80,000/- at the rate of Rs.5000/- per month in 16 instalments. In her cross examination she denied having issued a cheque dated 22.5.2009 of a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- to the complaint. She however, admitted that signature in cheque No. 028821 was her signature. According to her she issued two blank cheques in the name of the complainant. The relevant extract of her cross examination is as under: \"**** I gave two blank cheques, containing my signatures to Rnku Debnath. There was no written receipt or agreement in relation to the taking of money from Rinku Debnath or handing over blank cheque to him. I took the money and gave cheques to Rinku Debnath in the Agartala court premises. I issued the notice addressed to Swapan Paul after reading the contents and satisfied myself. In may notice I have stated that two cheques were for Rs.50,000/- and drawn on UBI, G. B. Bazar Branch, Agartala. It is not a fact that I did not hand over two blank cheques to Rinku Debnath in lieu of Rs.50,000/- loan taken my me. It is not a fact that I issued cheque worth Rs.1,30,000/- dated 22.05.2009 in favour of Rinku Debnath. The signature in the cheque No.028821 is my signature.\"(emphasis supplied) Accused produced her colleague Sanjib Roy as DW-2 who was also a clerk of an advocate. Said Sri Sanjib Roy, DW-2 in his examination in chief on affidavit asserted as follows: \"That, on 15-06-2009 Monday while I was purchasing Stamp paper from vender Chandan Kumar Bhowmik, I saw gathering of some people beside the vendors shop and on curiosity while I advanced I saw that Rinku @ Basu was tearing some papers. On my query I could know that there was a dispute regarding payment of loan amount of Rs.50,000/- between Sumana and Rinku today the matter had been settled and so Rinku @ Basu has torn the said cheque.\" In his cross examination he stated that he was not aware of actually what was settled between the accused and the complainant because he was not a part of the process. Among the other two witnesses who were examined as Court witnesses, Sri Rajarshi Debnath was the Branch Manager of UCO Bank, District Court Branch which was later renamed as High Court Branch. He was examined as CW-1. The other Court Witness was Sushil Ch. Deb, Branch Manager of UBI, G.B. Hospital Branch who was examined as CW-2. W-1 stated that cheque No.028821 dated 22.05.2009 of an amount of Rs.1,30,000/- was presented in his bank on 22.05.2009 by a deposit slip (Exbt.2). Thereafter the cheque was sent for clearance to UBI G.B hospital extension branch where the accused maintained her account. By producing the clearance register of his bank, CW-1 stated that the said cheque was sent for clearance on 25.05.2009. Relevant extract of the clearance register was produced by the witness in Court to prove the dispatch of the said cheque to UBI G, B Hospital extension branch for clearance. The trial Court after comparing the copy of the said document with the original produced by the Bank marked the copy as Exbt.C/1. In Cross examination the witness denied to have produced a manufactured document in the name of cheque clearance register.  CW-2 was the Branch Manager of UBI G.B. Hospital extension branch where the accused had maintained his account. The CW submitted a certified statement of the account of the accused for the period from 11.05.2009 to 27.07.2009 which was marked as Exbt.C/10. The PW further stated that old account number of the accused was 1449 which was later converted into new account No.1507010101449. The witness confirmed that the cheque returning memo (Exbt.-3) was issued from Agartala Branch of UBI as the Agartala Branch of UBI was the clearance branch. According to the witness, the said cheque was sent from UCO Bank district Court Branch, Agartala for clearance. In his cross examination, the PW stated that a cheque may be dishonoured for reasons other than insufficiency of fund. Aggrieved accused preferred appeal in the Court of the Sessions Judge in West Tripura Judicial District at Agartala\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nCounsel appearing for the complainant petitioner contends that the onus to rebut the statutory presumptions under Sections 138 and 139 of the N.I Act lies on the accused. According to learned counsel, the complainant has discharged his burden by proving that the cheque was issued by the accused. Now, the burden to prove the fact that said cheque was issued not for discharge of any debt or liability lies on the accused.  ccording to Mr. Bhowmik, learned counsel for the petitioner, the accused has not denied his signature appearing on the cheque. Her contention is that she issued a blank cheque in favour of the complainant petitioner which was later misutilized by the complainant by putting the said figure of Rs.1,30,000/-.  ccording to learned counsel, in the factual context of the case, the said plea of the accused cannot be treated as a probable defence. It is further contended by the counsel of the petitioner that accused is always entitled to produce materials to rebut the statutory presumptions to establish that the preponderance of probabilities were in his favour. According to learned counsel, though the accused gave oral evidence of herself and another witness as DW-1 and DW-2 she could not show that preponderance of probabilities were in her favour. Even in her examination under Section 313 Cr. P.C, except denial, she did not make out any defence case. In support of his contention Mr. Bhowmik, learned counsel of the accused has relied on the decision of the Apex Court in Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel Vrs. State of Gujarat and another; reported in (2019) 18 SCC 106 wherein the Apex Court has held as under: It is argued by learned counsel of the petitioner that the complainant by adducing sufficient evidence at the trial Court proved that the accused had borrowed loan of a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- from him and for purchasing a Maruti Car for business and for repaying her debt she admittedly issued a cheque in favour of the complainant which was dishonoured by the bank for insufficiency of fund in the account maintained by the accused. Thereafter the complainant issued statutory notice demanding repayment of the loan which was not responded by the accused. The complainant therefore prosecuted her under Section 138, N. I. Act and the trial court after recording evidence and hearing the parties held her guilty and convicted and sentenced her to punishment. But the appellate Court upset the judgment of conviction without assigning any reason. Learned counsel therefore, urges the Court to dismiss the judgment of the appellate Court by upholding the conviction and sentence of the accused. \nArgument by the Respondent:\nMr. S. Mahajan, learned advocate appearing for the accused respondent submits that the appellate Court rightly dismissed the judgment of the trial Court by setting aside the conviction and sentence of the accused. According to Mr. Mahajan, learned counsel it would not be appropriate for the High Court to take a different view because the appellate Court decided the matter on appreciation of evidence and acquitted the accused for lack of evidence. In a criminal revision High Court cannot re-appreciate the evidence unless it is shown that it would otherwise tantamount, to gross miscarriage of justice. \nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe trial Court examined the complainant petitioner under Section 200 Cr.P.C and after taking cognizance of offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, summoned the accused respondent. The accused sought for exemption from personal appearance which was rejected by the trial Court and to compel her appearance arrest warrant was issued against her. The complainant respondent also submitted a petition before the Court saying that the original cheque submitted by him along with his complaint was missing from the case record.  On appreciation of evidence, the learned trial Court arrived at the conclusion that the case was proved against the accused respondent and accordingly, she was found guilty of offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I Act and she was convicted for the said offence.  After hearing on sentence, she was sentenced to a fine of Rs.1,30,000/- and in default to suffer S.I for four months. It was ordered that the fine on realisation be paid to the complainant respondent as compensation. In appeal, the learned Additional Sessions Judge held that there was no legally enforceable debt and the complainant could not also prove the fact that he had sufficient fund to provide a loan of a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- to the accused respondent and more over he failed to prove the presentation of cheque at his bank, return of cheque for insufficiency of fund, service of statutory demand notice upon the accused respondent etc. and on those grounds the appellate Court allowed the appeal of the accused respondent and acquitted her by setting aside trial court's judgment.  On appreciation of evidence the trial Court held the accused guilty of offence punishable under Section 138, N.I. Act and sentenced her to a fine of Rs.1,30,000/- and in default of payment of fine, simple imprisonment for four months.  The appeal was heard by the Additional Sessions Judge,(Court No.2) at Agartala. The appellate Court reverted the decision of the Trial Court holding that the case against the accused was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. The accused was therefore held not guilty and acquitted of the charge. The complainant has challenged the said order of acquittal by filing the present criminal revision petition against the impugned order of the Additional Sessions Judge, Agartala\n",
    "Case_Result": "There is the mandate of presumption of consideration in terms of the provisions of the Act. The onus shifts to the accused on proof of issuance of cheque to rebut the presumption that the cheque was issued not for discharge of any debt or liability in terms of Section 138 of the Act which reads as under: It is a settled proposition of law that mere issuance of a cheque and its dishonour would not constitute an offence by itself under Section 138 N.I Act, 1881 unless the basic elements of Section 138 and the eventualities mentioned in Clauses (a), (b) and (c) in the proviso to Section 138 of the N.I. Act, 1881 are satisfied.From a plain reading of Section 138 of the N. I. Act, 1881 it appears that to make out an offence under Section 138 of the N.I Act, the following ingredients are required to be satisfied: (i) It has to be proved against the accused that he had drawn a cheque against the account maintained by him in a bank for certain amount of money payable to the complainant for discharge of any excising debt or other liability. (ii) Such cheque has to be presented by the complainant within six months from the date on which it was drawn or within the validity period of the cheque. (iii) It has to be proved that the said cheque was returned by the bank unpaid either because of insufficiency of fund in the account of the accused or because it exceeded the amount arranged to be paid from such account of the accused by an agreement made by him with the bank. (iv) After the cheque is dishonoured, the payee or the holder of the cheque is required to make a demand for payment of the cheque amount by giving a notice to the complainant/ drawer of the cheque within 15 days of receipt of the information by him from the bank. (v) Further, it has to be proved that the accused/drawer of the cheque failed to pay to the complainant the cheque amount within 15 days of receipt of the said notice.With regard to the service of statutory notice, accused pleaded that she did not receive any such notice after the cheque issued by her was allegedly dishonoured.The complainant seems to have proved by adducing documentary evidence that he issued such notice (Exbt.4) within 15 days from the date of his receiving the information from the bank that the cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of fund in the account of the accused. In this regard it has been held by the Apex Court in K. Bhaskaran Vrs. Sankaran Vaidhyan Balan and another; reported in (1999) 7 SCC 510 : (AIR 1999 SC 3762) that the notice can be deemed to have been served on the sendee where the sender has despatched the said notice by post with the correct address written on it unless the sendee proves that it was not really served and he was not responsible for such non service. It has been held by the Apex Court that any other interpretation can lead to a very tenuous position as the drawer of the cheque who is liable to pay the amount would resort to the strategy of subterfuge by successfully avoiding the notice. [27] In the given context, the accused and the complainant were known to each other for long because they worked together as advocate's clerk over a long period of time. Address of the accused was not unknown to the complaintant. It is no case of the accused that her address written on the notice dated 01.06.2009 (Exbt.4) was not correct.8. With regard to existing debt, the accused as DW-1 stated at the trial that she purchased a Maruti Car in 2004 by taking loan from a financer and when she failed to repay the loan she borrowed a sum of Rs.50,000/- from the complainant for which she paid him a sum of Rs.80,000/- in 16 monthly instalments. According to her she gave some blank cheques to the complainant as security for borrowing said sum of money from him on condition that the cheque would be returned to her once she repays the loan. According to her, despite payment of loan the complainant did not give back her cheque which was later misutilized by the complainant and the present case was filed against her. In her cross examination also she said that she issued two cheques in favour of the complainant. In this regard, she could not produce any evidence at all. She could not recall the dates on which those cheques were issued. She also stated in her evidence that the blank cheques and the stamp paper given by her to the complainant were destroyed by the complainant in her presence. herefore, question of using blank cheque against her is redundant. Moreover, though she denied to have issued the said cheque of the sum of Rs.1,30,000/- to the complainant, she has categorically admitted in her cross examination that the signature appearing on cheque No. 028821 (Exbt.1) was her own signature. The statement made by her is as under: \"The signature in the cheque No.028821 is my signature\" [29] The fact that she had the account in UBI, G.B. Hospital Extension branch and that fund in her account was insufficient when the impugned cheque was drawn by her is also proved by the branch manager of the said bank who has been examined as CW-2 by producing documentary evidence. CW-2 has proved the fact that the said cheque which was presented by the complainant for encashment in UCO Bank, District Court Branch was sent to UBI at Agartala branch for clearance from where the cheque was returned for insufficiency of fund vide cheque returning memo (Exbt.3). [30] CW-1, who was the Branch Manager of UCO Bank, District Court Branch, later renamed as High Court Branch also proved the presentation of the impugned cheque by the accused in UCO Bank and the fact that the same was sent for clearance to UBI. It has surfaced on record that the accused admitted that she once borrowed money from the petitioner for repaying her loan taken for purchasing a Maruti Car. According to her amount was Rs.50,000/- for which she repaid Rs.80,000/- in instalments to the accused. Her defence that she issued two blanks cheques to the complainant and the complainant did not return those cheques to her despite repayment of his loan is not at all provable in the given facts and circumstances of the case. She could not produce any iota of evidence in support of such contention of her. The accused on the other hand by producing documentary evidence has proved that the complainant issued the impugned cheque for sum of Rs.1,30,000/- for repayment of an existing debt and the said cheque was dishonoured by bank. Accused has also admitted her signature on the said cheque. The fact that after the cheque was dishonoured, complainant issued demand notice within the statutory period demanding the accused to pay the cheque amount is also proved Petition allowed",

The petitioner/complainant filed a complaint against the respondent/accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter, \"the NI Act\") stating inter alia that in discharge of his liability towards the petitioner/complainant, on 04/11/2008, the respondent/ accused issued a cheque bearing No. 728602 of the Durg Rajnandgaon Gramin Bank Branch Kawardha for Rs. 1,50,000/.  The petitioner/complainant presented the said cheque to his Bank on the next day i.e. 05/11/2008 and it was dishonoured and was returned to him on the same day. Thereafter, the petitioner/complainant issued a notice to the respondent/accused on 10/11/2008 by registered post which was served to him on 21/11/2008. The respondent/accused still did not pay the amount in dispute which led to the filing of the complaint by the petitioner/complainant before the jurisdictional criminal Court. .The respondent/accused abjured his guilt and entered into defence and examined himself as defence witness stating inter alia that he had signed a blank cheque with relation to an earlier transaction regarding the repair work of his tractor and it has been misused by the petitioner/ complainant and even the particulars of the cheque were not filled by him.  Feeling aggrieved by the order of conviction passed by the trial Court and the sentence imposed therein, the respondent/accused preferred an appeal before the Court of Sessions. The petitioner/complainant also preferred a revision against the order of the trial Court for enhancement of the sentence as well as fine imposed upon the respondent/accused .The instant petition as well as the acquittal appeal, both have been filed by the petitioner/ complainant against the order of the Sessions Court acquitting the respondent/accused and dismissing the revision for enhancement of sentence as well as fine imposed by the trial Court upon the respondent/accused\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: Learned trial Court, after evaluation of oral and documentary evidence on record, convicted the respondent/accused vide order dated 05/11/2011 for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act and sentenced him to imprisonment for one year and simultaneously also imposed a fine of Rs. 5,000/ upon him and also prescribed a default sentence in case the fine is not deposited by him.  Eventually, learned Additional Sessions Judge allowed the appeal of the respondent/accused vide impugned order dated 10/07/2012 and set aside the order of conviction passed by the trial Court and also dismissed the revision of the petitioner/complainant\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Mr. Awadh Tripathi, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner/complainant, would submit that learned Additional Session Judge is absolutely unjustified in holding that the petitioner/ complainant has failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/ accused in discharge of his debt or liability, as there is a presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act though it is a rebuttable presumption and the burden of proof lies upon the drawer of the cheque by adducing rebuttal evidence to prove that he did not issue the cheque towards any antecedent liability.  He would further submit that the respondent/accused having admitted his signature on the blank cheque cannot disown his liability by asserting that the cheque has been misused and he has not filled the particulars of the cheque, as such, the impugned order passed the Additional Sessions Judge reversing the order of conviction of the respondent/accused for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act passed by the trial Court deserves to be set aside and the order dismissing the revision petition also deserves to be set aside\n**Argument by Respondent**: .Mr. Vikas Pandey, learned counsel appearing for the respondent/accused, would support the impugned order passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge by which he has acquitted the respondent/accused holding that the petitioner/complainant has failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/accused in discharge of his liability is a finding based on evidence available on record, as such, the appellate Court has rightly acquitted the respondent/ accused for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

I have heard learned counsel for the parties, considered their rival submissions made herein above and perused the records with utmost circumspection. As noticed hereinabove, the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/accused on 04/11/2008 in favour of the petitioner/complainant for Rs. 1,50,000/ which was presented by the petitioner/complainant before his Bank on 05/11/2008 and the same day it stood dishonoured. Thereafter, in order to institute the complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act, the petitioner/ complainant issued a notice on 10/11/2008 which was served to the respondent/accused on 21/11/2008. Since no reply to the notice was filed by the respondent/accused, the petitioner/ complainant filed a complaint against him under Section 138 of the NI Act in which cognizance was taken against him for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act and the respondent/accused having entered into defence, denied the charges and took a specific defence that though he had no debt or liability towards the petitioner/complainant but yet he had signed a blank cheque in relation to some other earlier transaction. .Section 139 of the NI Act mandates that unless the contrary is proved, it is to be presumed that the holder of the cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in Section 138 for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability. However, the presumption is rebuttable by proving to the contrary. Section 139 of the NI Act introduces an exception to the general rule as to the burden of proof and shifts the onus on the accused to prove by cogent evidence that there was no debt or liability. Mere denial or rebuttal by the accused is not enough. In the instant case, no evidence has been adduced by the respondent/accused in rebuttal of the presumption enumerated under Section 139 of the NI Act showing that he had not drawn the cheque in question in favour of the petitioner/complainant for Rs. 1,50,000/ in discharge of his liability towards the petitioner/complainant.  As such, learned Additional Sessions Judge failed to notice the presumption as is available under Section 139 of the NI Act and is absolutely unjustified in holding that the petitioner/complainant has failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/accused in discharge of his debt or liability, as such, th finding recorded by learned Additional Session Judge deserves to be set aside. Now, coming to the next contention of learned counsel for the respondent/accused that the respondent/accused had signed a blank cheque and had not even filled the particulars of the cheque which has been misused by the petitioner/complainant, therefore, he is not liable to pay the petitioner/complainant further.  Reverting to the facts of the present case in light of the principle of law laid down by Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in Bir Singh (supra), it is a case of the respondent/accused from day one that he had signed a blank cheque and other particulars of the cheque were not even filled by him rather by the petitioner/complainant who has misused the cheque in question.  Learned trial Court convicted the respondent/accused for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act finding the ingredients of the same which was reversed by the appellate Court primarily on the ground that the petitioner/complainant has failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/accused in discharge of his existing liability towards the petitioner/complainant.\n",

Your task is to deliver a concise, well-reasoned verdict based on the case details provided. You should carefully analyze whether the ruling by the lower court was correct, taking into account the presented evidence, the arguments from both parties, and the applicable sections of the law.\n\n### **Case Details:**\n1. **Facts and Arguments of the case**: acts:\\n1. This criminal revision petition arises out of the judgment and order dated 26.07.2018 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Court No.2, Agartala in Criminal Appeal No.33 of 2017 reversing the judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 29.06.2017 delivered in Case No. NI 111 of 2009 by the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, West Tripura, Agartala. Aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said judgment of the Additional Sessions Judge, Agartala, the original complainant has preferred this revision petition challenging the order of acquittal of the respondent [2] Heard Mr. H. K. Bhowmik, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner as well as Mr. S. Mahajan, learned counsel appearing for the respondent. [3] Facts of the case are as under: Petitioner and respondent used to work as advocate's clerks at Agartala and, as such, they were known to each other. The respondent borrowed a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- on 30.10.2007 from the petitioner for purchasing a Maruti car for doing business. While taking the loan, the respondent assured the petitioner that she would repay the loan within six months. The petitioner then borrowed Rs.50,000/- from Sri Swapan Pal (PW-2) and Rs.80,000/- from his friend Sri Sajal Laskar and gave the entire sum of Rs.1,30,000/- as loan to the respondent. Despite lapse of the assured period of six months, the respondent did not repay the loan to the petitioner.  As a result of constant persuasion of the petitioner, the respondent ultimately issued a cheque in his name bearing No. MPS/M 028821 dated 22.05.2009 for a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- drawn on UBI, G.B Hospital extension counter at Agartala against her Savings Bank Account No.1449 towards repayment of the loan. The petitioner presented the said cheque for encashment in UCO Bank, High Court extension branch where he maintained Savings Bank Account No.4485. The cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of fund in the said account of the respondent and the fact was informed to the petitioner from his bank vide cheque returning memo dated 27.05.2009 (Exbt.3). [4] The petitioner then issued statutory demand notice dated 01.06.2009 (Exbt.4) to the respondent in terms of Section 138 of the N.I. Act demanding repayment of the said amount. The respondent having failed to make the payment within the notice period, the petitioner filed a complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. Act in the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, West Tripura at Agartala. [5] The case was then made over to the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class (Court No.5) at Agartala for trial. The bench clerk was directed by the trial Court to report about the veracity of the claim of the complainant with regard to filing of the original cheque in Court. Thereafter the Court did not proceed further with this issue  At the commencement of trial, the accusation against the accused respondent was explained to her in terms of Section 251 Cr.P.C which reads as under: \\\"The substance of accusation is that you, Smt. Sumana Saha on 30.10.2007 took loan of Rs.1,30,000/- from the complt., Rinku Debnath @ Basu and on demand, in response to the return of the loan amount, on 22.5.09 you issued a cheque being No.028821 for Rs.1,30,000/- drawn on UBI, Agartala, G.B Extension Br. in favour of the complt. On 25.5.2009 complt. submitted the said cheque before his banker, U.Co. Bank, High Court Br. for encashment but on 27.5.2009 the said bank informed him by issuing a return memo that the cheque was dishonoured due to insufficient fund and inspite of receiving the demand notice you did not make any payment of Rs.1,30,000/- within the stipulated period, as such you violated the provision of Sec.138 of N.I. Act.\\\" Accused respondent pleaded not guilty and claimed a trial During trial, complainant examined himself as PW-1 and one Sri Swapan Paul as PW-2. The trial Court also summoned the Branch Manager of UCO Bank, High Court Branch in exercise of power under Section 311, Cr.P.C and examined the witnesse as Court Witness(CW) No.1. Similarly, the trial Court summoned the Branch Manager of UBI, G. B. P Hospital extension branch and examined him as Court Witness(CW) No.2. After the recording of the prosecution evidence and examination of the Court witnesses was over, the trial Court examined the accused respondent under Section 313 Cr. P.C and recorded her statement. She pleaded innocence and claimed that the charge was foisted on her. She also desired to adduce evidence on her behalf. Accordingly, the accused examined two witnesses including herself. She examined herself as DW-1 and one Sanjib Roy, an advocate's clerk as DW-2. Hence, the aggrieved complainant has filed this criminal revision petition challenging the impugned judgment of the appellate Court One of the most essential things which is required to be seen in a case under Section 138 of the N.I Act is whether the cheque represents discharge of existing enforceable debt or liability or whether it reflects advance payment without there being a subsisting debt or liability. In the given context, complainant PW-1 stated in his examination in chief that in the month of October in 2007, his colleague Smt. Sumana Saha, accused, approached him for a loan for purchasing a Maruti car for commercial use. On her assurance that she would return the money within six months, PW-1 gave her Rs.1,30,000/- by borrowing the money from two of his friends namely, Sri Swapan Pal and Sri Sajal Laskar. The said sum of money was paid by him to the accused on 30.10.2007 in presence of said Swapan pal and Sajal Laskar when the accused assured him that she would return the money within six months After lot of persuasion, the accused issued cheque No. MPS/M/No.028821 dated 22.05.2009 drawn on UBI, G.B Hospital extension counter for a sum of Rs.1,30,000/-. PW-1 presented the said cheque for encashment in UCO Bank, High Court Branch where he maintained savings bank account No. 4485 in his name. According to him he presented the cheque on 25.5.2009. On 27.5.2009 the cheque was returned by his banker with a return memo (Exbt.3) for insufficiency of funds in the account of the accused. Initially he asked the accused to make the payment. Seeing her reluctant in making the payment, he served statutory demand notice on the accused within 15 days. The notice was returned unserved with a report that the addressee was not found in the given address. The PW then approached the Court by filing a complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  In the cross examination of the witness, there is no denial of payment of said loan to the accused by the complainant. it would be appropriate to reproduce the cross examination of PW-1 which is as under : \\\"The accused is an advocate's clerk and used to work with me. I gave loan to the accused for Rs.1,30,000/-. I gave the money after collecting it from Swapan Paul and Sajal Laskar. I have given the money in full amount at a time in presence of Swapan and Sajal in cash and a money receipt was issued in my name only. I have not given any receipt to Swapan and Sajal for taking money from them. I deposited the cheque on 25.05.09 and on 27.05.09 I was informed about dishonour of cheque. I gave advocate notice on 01.06.09. The demand notice was not received by the accused and the notice was returned but I do not remember the date of return. I have after refusal of notice given the address of the accused to post office, I have not submitted any copy to show that I submitted it to the post office. It is not a fact that I wilfully sent the demand notice to wrong address. It is not a fact that accused repaied me the loan of Rs.1,30,000/- or I tore the original cheque intentionally and submitted a photocopy of the same before the court or for this reason I filed the complaint petition after the statutory period. It is not true that I am not entitle to get any money from the accused.\\\"  Said Swapan Pal, PW-1 from whom complainant PW-1 borrowed Rs.50,000/- for giving the loan to the accused also deposed at the trial as PW-2. In his examination in Chief, the PW stated that pursuant to the request of the PW-1 he gave him Rs.50,000/- to him to give the loan to the accused. The complainant borrowed more Rs.80,000/- from Sajal Laskar and gave a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- to the accused as loan in his presence. PW-2 further stated that the accused assured repayment of the loan within six months. When she did not return the loan within the period assured by her, the PW accompanied the complaint to her house at 79 tilla within jurisdiction of East Agartala police station when the accused stated to them that she did not have any cash at that moment. Therefore, she issued the said cheque of a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- to the complainant which was later dishonoured for insufficiency of fund in her account. In his cross examination, the PW-2 made the following statement: \\\"I do not have any licence for money lending. I gave money to Rinku Debnath on 30.10.07 but I did not obtain any money receipt from him. I do not know the accused Rinku took money from me to give money to Sumana saha when the money was taken I did not know Sumana Saha. I have not never personally asked the accused to return the money. I do not know how Sumana was supposed to return the money. I do not know whether accused paid back the loan to Rinku or not.\\\"  Smt. Sumana Saha who is the accused gave statement as DW-1. In her examination-in- chief on affidavit she admitted that she worked as an advocate's clerk and she was acquainted with the complainant who was also a clerk of another advocate. She further stated that in 2004 she purchased a Maruti Car by taking loan from a non banking financial institution and due to non payment of loan in time, her vehicle was confiscated by the loan giver. She had then taken a loan of a sum of Rs.50,000/- from the complainant on condition that she would pay Rs.5000/- per month for 16 months to the complainant for which she gave signed blank cheque and stamp papers to the complainant on condition that those documents would be returned to her after repayment of the loan. Thereafter, she paid Rs.80,000/- to the complainant by paying monthly instalments of Rs.5000/- for 16 months though she had taken a loan of Rs.50,000/- only. Despite repayment of loan, the complaint did not return the cheque and stamp papers to her. The matter was later settled between them and the said blank cheque and stamp papers were destroyed by the complainant in her presence. Subsequently, she received a notice from Court and came to know that complainant filed a case against her for realisation of Rs.1,30,000/-. According to the DW she had never taken such loan from complainant. She stuck to her version that she had taken a loan of Rs.50,000/- only from the complaint for which she paid him Rs.80,000/- at the rate of Rs.5000/- per month in 16 instalments. In her cross examination she denied having issued a cheque dated 22.5.2009 of a sum of Rs.1,30,000/- to the complaint. She however, admitted that signature in cheque No. 028821 was her signature. According to her she issued two blank cheques in the name of the complainant. The relevant extract of her cross examination is as under: \\\"**** I gave two blank cheques, containing my signatures to Rnku Debnath. There was no written receipt or agreement in relation to the taking of money from Rinku Debnath or handing over blank cheque to him. I took the money and gave cheques to Rinku Debnath in the Agartala court premises. I issued the notice addressed to Swapan Paul after reading the contents and satisfied myself. In may notice I have stated that two cheques were for Rs.50,000/- and drawn on UBI, G. B. Bazar Branch, Agartala. It is not a fact that I did not hand over two blank cheques to Rinku Debnath in lieu of Rs.50,000/- loan taken my me. It is not a fact that I issued cheque worth Rs.1,30,000/- dated 22.05.2009 in favour of Rinku Debnath. The signature in the cheque No.028821 is my signature.\\\"(emphasis supplied) Accused produced her colleague Sanjib Roy as DW-2 who was also a clerk of an advocate. Said Sri Sanjib Roy, DW-2 in his examination in chief on affidavit asserted as follows: \\\"That, on 15-06-2009 Monday while I was purchasing Stamp paper from vender Chandan Kumar Bhowmik, I saw gathering of some people beside the vendors shop and on curiosity while I advanced I saw that Rinku @ Basu was tearing some papers. On my query I could know that there was a dispute regarding payment of loan amount of Rs.50,000/- between Sumana and Rinku today the matter had been settled and so Rinku @ Basu has torn the said cheque.\\\" In his cross examination he stated that he was not aware of actually what was settled between the accused and the complainant because he was not a part of the process. Among the other two witnesses who were examined as Court witnesses, Sri Rajarshi Debnath was the Branch Manager of UCO Bank, District Court Branch which was later renamed as High Court Branch. He was examined as CW-1. The other Court Witness was Sushil Ch. Deb, Branch Manager of UBI, G.B. Hospital Branch who was examined as CW-2. W-1 stated that cheque No.028821 dated 22.05.2009 of an amount of Rs.1,30,000/- was presented in his bank on 22.05.2009 by a deposit slip (Exbt.2). Thereafter the cheque was sent for clearance to UBI G.B hospital extension branch where the accused maintained her account. By producing the clearance register of his bank, CW-1 stated that the said cheque was sent for clearance on 25.05.2009. Relevant extract of the clearance register was produced by the witness in Court to prove the dispatch of the said cheque to UBI G, B Hospital extension branch for clearance. The trial Court after comparing the copy of the said document with the original produced by the Bank marked the copy as Exbt.C/1. In Cross examination the witness denied to have produced a manufactured document in the name of cheque clearance register.  CW-2 was the Branch Manager of UBI G.B. Hospital extension branch where the accused had maintained his account. The CW submitted a certified statement of the account of the accused for the period from 11.05.2009 to 27.07.2009 which was marked as Exbt.C/10. The PW further stated that old account number of the accused was 1449 which was later converted into new account No.1507010104. The relevant extract of the statement of account is as under: \\\"From the above statement of account of the accused, it is clear that no debit entry was made in the account of the accused for the amount of Rs.1,30,000/- on the date of cheque No.028821 dated 22.05.2009. No amount of Rs.1,30,000/- was credited in the account of the accused from the date of cheque till 27.05.2009. The account was closed on 25.05.2009 and the balance in the account was Rs.33,853.82.\\\" In his cross examination, the CW stated that he cannot say that the account was closed on 25.05.2009. The account was closed on 27.05.2009 and the balance in the account was Rs.33,853.82. The cheque was dishonoured for insufficiency of fund in the account of the accused on 27.05.2009.

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. Heard Mr. D. C. Roy, learned counsel appearing for the appellants. Also heard Mr. D.J. Saha, learned counsel appearing for the respondent. 2. This appeal arises out of the acquittal judgment dated 17.05.2017, passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Unakoti Judicial District, Kamalpur, Dhalai in Criminal Appeal No.17 of 2016, by way of returning a reversal finding of judgment and order of conviction and sentence dated 21.07.2016, passed in case No.CR.(NI) 04 of 2014 by the learned SDJM, Kamalpur, Unakoti Judicial District, convicting and sentencing the respondent-accused, Sri Sanjit Chakraborty to suffer SI for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1,65,000/- with default stipulation for commission of offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act(N.I. Act for short), 1881. . Prosecution case, briefly put, is as under:- 3(1). On account of friendship, the complainant had accommodated the respondent- accused(here-in-after referred to as 'respondent') a sum of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees fifty thousand) on 20.09.2014 and Rs.1,00,000/-(Rupees one lakh) on 19.10.2014, in total Rs.1,50,000/-(Rupees one lakh fifty thousand). It is the specific plea of the complainant that he made such payment to the respondent in presence of the witnesses.  The complainant further claimed that towards repayment of the said amount, the respondent had issued two cheques, bearing No.740950 dated 20.09.2014 for a sum of Rs.50,000/-(Rupees fifty thousand) and No.740949 for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-(Rupees one lakh) in favour of the complainant. The said two cheques were drawn on UBI, Ambassa Branch. When the cheques were presented for encashment through SBI, Ambassa Branch, the same was dishonored with the endorsement 'insufficient fund' in the concerned account of the respondent.   The complainant, thereafter, issued a statutory notice by registered post with A/D on 15.11.2014 through his learned advocate demanding the payment within 15(fifteen) days, which was duly served upon the respondent on 18.11.2014. Thus, on account of the failure of the respondent to pay the amount in spite of the issuance of the notice, the complainant filed the complaint against the respondent under Section 138 of the said Act before the learned SDJM, Kamalpur.  3(4). Trial was conducted by the learned SDJM, Kamalpur with the framing of charge against the respondent which reads as follows: \"Allegation against you that on 20-09-2014 and 19-10-2014, you issued two cheques bearing No.740950 dated 20-09-2014 for Rs.50,000/- and another bearing no.740949 dated 19-10-2014 for Rs.1,00,000/- drawn on your bank account maintained with the State Bank of India, Ambassa Branch to the complainant Narayan Debnath for repayment of loan. Both the chqeues returned by the bank unpaid because of 'Insufficient Fund' in your account to honour the cheques while complainant presented the same in his bank account for encashment and thus, you thereby committed the offence of dishonor of cheques punishable u/sec. 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 and within the cognizance of this court.\" (5). In course of trial, the complainant examined himself as PW1 and produced two cheques in question i.e. Exbt.1/A and Exbt.1/B, signature of the respondent in the acknowledgement to legal notice(Exbt.2), the copy of the legal notice(Exbt.3) and bank return memo(Exbt.4). The complainant also examined one Dilip Dey as PW2. Defending the complaint, the respondent examined himself as DW1, apart from that one Ratan Hari Debbarma was examined as DW2. On the basis of the aforesaid charge, trial was commenced. The complainant, as PW1, during his chief examination, has stated thus:\\n\\n\"1. That, I am the complainant of the instant case and I lodged this case against the accused Sri Sanjit Chakraborty. Both of us residing within the Ambassa Sub-Division and I have long relation with Accused person/Opposite Party. The Opposite party/Accused Person approached me in the month of September 2014 to give him an amount of Rs.50,000/-(Fifty thousand only) and another amount of Rs-100,000/-(one Lac fifty Thousands Only) in presence of witness, to meet up some of his urgent financial requirements, on condition that, he would refund the same in the month of November 2014 A.D and I made payment to him the said amounts. These are true to my knowledge.\\n\\n2. That, since I had long relation with the Accused Person/Opposite party I did not feel it necessary to execute any document with reference to the said payments of Rs.50.000/-(Rupees Fifty thousand only). And another amount of Rs-100,000/-(One Lac only) These are true to my knowledge\\n\\n3. That, I am a businessman by profession and being in need of money in connection with my business I requested the Accused Person/Opposite st party in the 1 week of November 2014, for refunding the said borrowed amounts as I was in dire need of money. The accused person assured me and told me you please deposit the cheques bearing No-740950 dated- 20/09/2014 an amounting of Rs-50.000/-(Fifty Thousands Only) and another cheque bearing No-740949 dated- 19/10/2014 an amounting of Rs-100.000/-(One Lac Only), on submission of the same in the account it would be duly honoured and advised me to encash the same from his account.\" Thereafter, the complainant stated that he deposited the said two chqeues to his bankers, but by a return memo the bankers stated that the cheque amount could not be en-cashed due to \"insufficient fund\". That led the complainant to issue the demand notice through his learned counsel, demanding the payment of the chqeue amount. However, the respondent did not pay any amount. Hence, the complainant filed the instant complaint before the learned SDJM, Kamalpur for appropriate redress. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\n4. Mr. D.C. Roy, learned counsel appearing for the complainant has submitted that the respondent had never denied that he did not issue the said cheques in favour of the complainant. Next, the learned counsel has pointed out that the cheques, i.e. Exbt.1/A and Exbt.1/B were issued in discharge of his liability. According to Mr. Roy, learned counsel, the respondent had borrowed the loan of Rs.1,50,000/- on two different dates from the complainant. The complainant during his deposition had furnished those cheques, which were marked as Exbt.1/ A and Exbt.1/B being formally proved. Mr. Roy, learned counsel has given much emphasis to the judgment of the trial Court where the learned Court returned the finding of guilt against the respondent.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n5. Per contra, Mr. D.J. Saha, learned counsel appearing for the respondent has submitted that the complainant has failed to establish that he had any legally enforceable debt to the respondent.  The cheques i.e. Exbt.1/A and Exbt.1/B were kept by the complainant on the date of paying the loan as security and the respondent did not issue the said cheques in discharge of his liability against any debt as claimed by the complainant. As such, according to Mr. Saha, learned counsel, issuing the cheques as a matter of security would not come into the purview of Section 138 of the N.I. Act.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n The learned SDJM, Kamalpur after considering the evidence and materials on record held that the respondent issued those cheques in discharge of his liability and, hence passed an order of conviction and sentence as afore-stated . The respondent preferred a statutory appeal before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Unakoti Judicial District, Kamalpur. The appeal, on being admitted and having heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsels appearing for the parties, the learned Additional Sessions Judge by his judgment dated 17.05.2017, passed in Criminal Appeal No.17 of 2016 allowed the appeal setting aside the order of conviction and sentence as declared by the learned SDJM, Kamalpur, and thus, acquitted the respondent from the charge levelled against him by the complainant. Hence, the complainant has preferred the instant criminal appeal before this Court.\n",
    "Case_Result": "6. I have considered the rival submissions of the learned counsels appearing for the parties and also taken note of the documents produced by the parties before the trial Court.he respondent had adduced evidence as DW1 and also produced another witness, namely Ratan Hari Debbarma, who adduced evidence as DW2. I have also taken note of the reply given by the respondent at the time of his examination under Section 313 of CrPC. In reply to question No.13, the respondent has stated thus: \"Once I gave a cheque to PW-1 on his assurance that he would provide us an old car to launch driving school through NGO. In the meantime, I noticed his activity is not satisfactory; hence I did not proceed further with that plan. He told(sic) me that the said cheque went missing. but later, he brought false allegation of this(sic) case.\"7. In his evidence, the respondent as DW1 had stated that he was involved in an NGO which used to undertake various development works in different places of Tripura, and the complainant being a Mechanic was engaged as a Site Manager with that NGO to open a Driving School and two blank cheques were signed by the respondent and handed over to the complainant to run the institution. But, on 21.11.2014, the complainant reported the respondent that those two cheques were missing from his custody for which the respondent reported the same to the police station and also to the bank. DW1, i.e. the respondent also deposed that the complainant had misused the cheques for his illegal gain. The respondent substantiated his plea that he informed the matter to the bank by way of bringing the said prayer before the learned Court in course of his examination and the said communication was marked as Exbt.D/1. Similarly, the respondent also brought on record the prayer for GD Entry in respect of the lost cheques and another prayer for GD Entry in respect of loss of the registered letter and those were marked as Exbt.D/2 and Exbt.D/3 respectively. In my opinion, the entire scheme of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 draws a clear distinction between a check issued for a debt in present but payable in future and second for a debt which may become payable in future upon the occurrence of a contingent event. Thus, there is no dispute about the proposition which is well settled that wherever a cheque is given purely as a security, its dishonor would not make the drawer of the cheque criminally liable for an offence under Section 138 of the Act.10. In the present case, it is aptly clear that the complainant provided loan to the respondent for a sum of Rs.50,000/- on 20.09.2014 and Rs.1,00,000/- on 19.10.2014 and on the same date, on providing of such loan to the respondent, he received two cheques(Exbt.1/A and Exbt.1/ B) from the respondent. According to the complainant, towards repayment of the said amount, the respondent had issued the said two cheques. Thus, it is apparent that the respondent issued the cheques on the dates of borrowing the loan from the complainant as is revealed from the deposition of the complainant itself that the respondent promised to make repayment of the loan in the month of November, 2014 i.e., the cheque would be effective on a future date.1. Keeping in view the date of advancing the loan and the date of issuance of the cheques, in my opinion, those cheques i.e. Exbt.1/A and Exbt.1/B were issued as a security cheque to meet up the future liability, which might have been occurred on failure of repayment of loan in the month of November, 2014.12. Be that as it may, in my opinion, nature of transaction shows that the loan was given only after issuance of cheques by the respondent. In other words, the complainant provided the loan after obtaining the cheques from the respondent. The above justifies that the cheques were taken by the complainant as a security cheque to advance the loan and not against any existing or past legal enforceable debt. Therefore, the cheques issued by the respondent shall not be treated as a cheque issued towards discharging any past or existing liability.13. The deposition of PW2, Sri Dilip Dey further substantiates the fact that the complainant had received the cheques of Rs.50,000/- and Rs.1,00,000/- \"at the time of payment\". In furtherance thereof, I find that the complainant failed to disclose the source of fund. He did not furnish any evidence in support of his claim that he had financial ability to give loan of Rs.1,50,000/- to the respondent. Though he deposed that he was an income tax payee, but, he did not furnish any such document in support of the fact that he was an income tax payee. Petition dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4e498bd6a9795e96fe\n**Facts**: Though this matter is listed for Admission, with the consent of learned counsel from both side, the same is heard finally.  The complaint of the present appellant filed in the Court of the XX Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru City (hereinafter referred to as the \"Trial Court\" for the sake of brevity), resulted in acquittal of the accused/respondent by the trial Court by its judgment dated 21.07.2015. Challenging the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.  It is the summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court that the accused was his student, as such, the accused is a person known to him. It is in this context the complainant lent him a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/- in the month of July-2012, on the condition that the accused should repay the same within two months thereafter. However, the accused failed to repay the said amount at the demand made by the complainant.  The accused issued him a cheque dated 01.10.2012, for a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/-, in the last month of September 2012. When the same was presented for realisation, it returned dishonoured with an endorsement that \"account closed\". According to the complainant, thereafter, he issued a statutory notice to the accused and the same came to be returned un-served. Thereafter, the complainant filed a complaint under Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Cr.P.C.\" for the sake of brevity) against the accused in the trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the \"N.I. Act\" for the sake of brevity). For the sake of convenience, the parties would be referred to as per their ranks before the trial Court. The accused appeared and contested the matter.  In order to prove his case, the complainant got himself examined as PW.1 and got marked documents as per Exs.P-1 to 7. The accused got himself examined as DW.1 and got marked documents as per Exs.D-1 to 12.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  After hearing both side, the trial Court by its judgment dated 21.07.2015, acquitted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. It is against the said judgment of acquittal, the complainant has preferred this appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the appellant while reiterating the contention of the appellant taken in the Memorandum of Appeal submitted that the trial Court has erred in not giving the benefit of presumption under Section 139 of the N.I. Act in favour of the appellant. He also submitted that the trial Court also lost sight of the fact that the parties were known to each other and the appellant who had surplus fund after selling his house property lent a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/- to the accused.  According to the complainant, the occasion to lend money to the accused arose to him only for the reason that the accused was his student. It is for the said reason when the accused is said to have approached him for financial assistance in the month of July-2012, he gave him a hand loan of Rs. 1,15,000/-, towards repayment of which, the accused gave him the cheque in question. The complainant in his evidence as PW.1, has reiterated the said contention. However, in his cross-examination when specific questions were put from the side of the accused as to in which year and in which school the accused was his student, the complainant could only say that the accused was his student in Siddaganga Mutt High School.  However, he has stated that he does not remember as to which year the accused was his student. A specific suggestion was made to the complainant in his cross-examination to the effect that the accused has never been his student and that he has not studied in Siddaganga Mutt, on the other hand, the accused has completed his High School at Sri. Basaveshwara High School at Kolala of Tumakuru District. In order to support the said contention of the accused that he was a student of Sri. Basaveshwara High School at Kolala of Tumakuru District, he has also produced the certified copy of his SSLC marks card at Ex.D-10, Certified copy of the character certificate at Ex.D-11 and certified copy of the cumulative record at Ex.D-12. Those documents remained undenied and they clearly show that the accused has completed his 10th standard in the year April-1980 from Sri. Basaveshwara High School, Kolala. Thus, the first statement of the complainant that the accused was a person known to him as his student in Siddaganga Mutt High School, has been falsified by the accused by leading not only rebuttal evidence, but also producing cogent documents and confronting the same in the cross-examination of PW.1.  It is the contention of the complainant that the accused has been a resident of Hanumanthagiri Village, Kolala Hobli, Koratagere Taluk, Tumakuru District, as such the legal notice as required under Section 138 of the N.I. Act was sent to him to the said address. The contention of the accused was that he is a permanent resident of Bengaluru, as such, the question of he residing at Hanumanthagiri Village, Kolala Hobli, Koratagere Taluk, Tumakuru District, does not arise. It is for the said reason, the legal notice at Ex.P-5 returned to the sender/complainant without its service upon the addressee. It is in that regard, apart from making suggestions to the complainant in his cross-examination as PW.1, the accused has also produced certain documents showing his address proof at Bengaluru and those documents include the certified copy of the rental agreement at Ex.D-1, certified copy of the gas connection application at Ex.D-2, certified copy of bank pas books at Exs.D-3 and 4, certified copies of the school identity cards of the daughters of the accused at Exs.D-5 and 6, so also their marks cards at Exs.D-7 and 8.  The accused has also produced the certified copy of his EPIC card at Ex.D-9. All these documents clearly go to show that the accused is not the resident of Hanumanthagiri Village, Kolala Hobli, Koratagere Taluk, Tumakuru District, but he is a resident of Kamakshipalya, Bengaluru and Basaveshwara Nagar, Bengaluru and those documents produced by the accused clearly establishes that all those documents reveal the address at Bengaluru as that of the place of residence of both accused and his school going daughters. When this aspect was put in the mouth of the complainant in his cross-examination, the complainant as PW.1 has stated that since the mother of the accused was at Kolala, he presumed that the accused was residing there and as such, notice was sent to that address. The complainant has not denied the place of residence or the address of the accused at Bengaluru. However, based upon certain assumptions made by him, the complainant has sent notice to such an address which was not the address or the place of residence of the accused, as such, the notice at Ex.P-5 has been returned un-served. Thus, there is non-compliance of service of statutory notice, which service of notice is mandatory as provided under Section 138(b) of the N.I. Act.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent/accused in his argument submitted that the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption existing in favour of the appellant. The accused could able to establish that the complainant was a stranger to him and that under no circumstance, the cheque in question was issued to him by the accused bilaterally.  The cheque issued to one Smt. Meenakshamma as security to the loan, was misused by filling the contents by the complainant. He also submitted that the accused has proven his case to the effect that he was not at all a resident of the address to which the notice has been sent by the complainant. As such, there is no compliance of the statutory requirement of service of notice upon the accused before filing the complaint.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  Section 139 of the N.I. Act makes out a presumption in favour of the payee/holder of the cheque. Unless and until the accused rebuts in a process known to law, the presumption that the cheque was issued in favour of the payee for a legally enforceable debt or liability, would be presumed under law. In the instant case even after keeping the said presumption under consideration in favour of the complainant, when the materials placed before this Court are analysed, the following points can be noticed: The accused in the cross-examination of PW.1 has also raised a doubt about the availability of the fund or the source of fund with the complainant to lend loan of Rs. 1,15,000/-. It is in that connection that the complainant has stated that in the month of March-2012, he had sold his house property for a sum of Rs. 5,50,000/- and has retained the sale proceeds in his bank account. It is to lend money to the accused he has withdrawn a sum of Rs. 1,15,000/-, fifteen days prior to the said loan transaction from the said bank. The complainant as PW.1 has also stated that he could able to produce the bank statement for having drawn such amount from his bank account. However, despite making such statement when there was a specific suggestion that there was no source of fund for the complainant to lend money, the complainant has not produced any of the bank account details to show that there was sufficient fund in his bank account by which he has withdrawn Rs. 1,15,000/-, which he has contended in the cross-examination.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "1. The main issue of the case is whether the respondent should be convicted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 for issuing two cheques, which were dishonored by the bank due to 'insufficient funds' in the respondent's account.\n\n2. The lower court's judgment is critical to assess. The court held that the respondent issued those cheques in discharge of his liability and, hence passed an order of conviction and sentence. However, in doing so, the lower court might have overlooked the crucial distinction between a cheque being issued as security and as discharge of a debt. The respondent's argument that the cheques were kept as security and not issued in discharge of any debt holds weight.\n\n3. Therefore, the appeal should be allowed. The lower court's judgment is not in accordance with the law as it did not consider the distinction between a cheque being issued as security and as discharge of a debt. Since the evidence and arguments presented by the respondent support his contention, the conviction and sentence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act are not warranted.\n\nOutput: ALLOWED"

The appellant is aggrieved by the judgment dated 30th April, 2019 passed by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh holding the appellant guilty of offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\") after reversal of the finding of acquittal returned by the learned trial Judge by its judgment dated 28th September, 2012. 3. The brief facts of the case which emanates from the record are that the appellant accused approached the complainant respondent in its factory at Moginand and expressed her desire to purchase non-woven fabric from the complainant. On the basis of order placed by the appellant, non-woven fabric was sold to the appellant vide invoice No.120 dated 01th October, 2010 and invoice No.135 dated 16th October, 2010 amounting to Rs.5,07,062/- and Rs.5,10,000/- which was delivered through public carrier truck bearing Nos. HR-38G-5607 and HP-71-0693 to the appellant accused and in lieu thereof, a cheque bearing No.323930 dated 15th October, 2010 and No.323935 dated 01st November, 2010 were issued by the appellant in the name of the complainant from her account of the Punjab National Bank, Karnal in order to meet the legal existing and enforceable liabilities.  The cheques on presentation were returned vide memo dated 19 October, 2010 and 10 November, 2010 from Punjab National Bank, Karnal with a note of \"insufficient funds\" in the account of the appellant. Two legal notices dated 29th October, 2010 and 19th November, 2010 were sent by the complainant to the appellant on two addresses. The notices were duly served but the appellant neither responded to the notices nor made any payment in furtherance thereto within the statutory period hence, two separate complaints were filed by the complainant respondent under Section 138 of the Act against the appellant accused.  The complainant-respondent recorded the preliminary evidence before the learned trial Judge and thereafter, the appellant-accused was directed to be summoned for committing an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act. After the presence of the appellant had been secured, the learned trial Judge put notice of accusation, vis-a-viz the accused, for an offence allegedly committed by her under Section 138 of the Act whereto she pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 5. The complainant in order to prove its case against the appellant-accused, has examined three witnesses and placed reliance on the documentary evidence which were duly exhibited and referred to in detail by the learned trial Judge in para 3 of its judgment. On conclusion of recording of complainant's evidence, the statement of the appellant-accused was recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the \"Code\") by the learned trial Judge wherein the appellant-accused claimed innocence and pleaded false implication in the case however, did not lead any evidence in defence.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the complainant was not able to prove that the material/goods were ever sent or received by the appellant and in terms of the complaint, the burden was on the complainant to prove that the material/goods were received by the appellant, against which the cheques were received as security and even though the appellant has not placed any evidence to disprove or rebut the presumption in defence, still the complainant has to discharge its burden and has to stand on his own legs. In the absence of the prima facie burden being discharged by the complainant, mere issuance of the cheques by the appellant would not have been sufficient to justify that the cheques were issued in discharge of any debt or other liability. 9. Learned counsel for the appellant further submits that the appellant was able to succeed in creating a doubt in the mind of the court below with regard to the non-existence of the debt or liability, and the learned trial court had returned the finding based on the material available on record.  Unless it was found to be perverse or unsustainable, or a case of non-consideration of any relevant material, the High Court was not justified in reversing and setting aside the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court merely on the ground that the view expressed by the High Court is more plausible with what being expressed by the trial court in its judgment dated 28th September, 2012. 10. Learned counsel for the appellant further submits that the finding recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment is contrary to the settled principles of law as considered by this Court in appreciating the mandate of Sections 118(a), 138 and 139 of the Act. In consequence thereof, the finding of guilt which has been recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment is unsustainable in law, and has to be set aside.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n11. Per contra, learned counsel for the complainant-respondent while supporting the finding recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment submitted that there was sufficient material available on record to justify that these cheques were issued with reference to the invoices after delivery of goods, which were duly exhibited, and cheques were issued in lieu thereof. In the sequence of facts, the cheques issued by the appellant, on due presentation to the bank got dishonoured on the ground of \"insufficient funds\".  The statutory notice was issued to the appellant, who failed to respond. The complaints were filed by placing all documentary evidence in support of the complaint duly exhibited, and three witnesses in support thereof were examined, and was able to establish and discharge the burden of proof. It was for the appellant to come forward with her defence, and prove to the contrary as envisaged under Section 139 of the Act.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n On perusal of the evidence on record, the learned trial Judge returned a finding that the complainant failed to establish that the material/goods were delivered to the appellant in lieu of which, the cheques were issued, and in the absence of burden being discharged by the complainant, the onus to disprove or rebut the presumption could not be shifted to the appellant as referred under Section 139 of the Act. Accordingly, the trial court returned the finding of acquittal of the appellant, which was the subject matter of challenge in appeal before the High Court at the instance of the complainant. 7. The High Court on reappraisal of the evidence on record affirmed that the primary burden was discharged by the complainant that the cheques were issued by the appellant in lieu of the material supplied, and documentary evidence duly exhibited was placed on record to substantiate the claim, and it was for the appellant-accused to discharge her burden to rebut in defence as required under Section 139 of the Act. In the instant case, the appellant only recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code.  However, no evidence was recorded to disprove or rebut the presumption in defence. Taking into consideration the overall material on record while setting aside the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial Judge, held that the appellant was guilty of committing an offence under Section 138 of the Act and consequently, awarded appropriate punishment of fine/sentence by the impugned judgment dated 30th April, 2019, which is the subject matter of challenge in appeals before us.\n",
    "Case_Result": "12. In the instant case, the appellant has only recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code, and has not adduced any evidence to rebut the presumption that the cheques were issued for consideration. Once the facts came on record remained unrebutted and supported with the evidence on record with no substantive evidence of defence of the appellant to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing in the complaint against her, no error has been committed by the High Court in the impugned judgment, and the appellant has been rightly convicted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act and needs no interference of this Court.13. The object of introducing Section 138 and other provisions of Chapter XVII in the Act appears to be to enhance the acceptability of cheques in the settlement of liabilities. The drawer of the cheque be held liable to prosecution on dishonour of cheque with safeguards provided to prevent harassment of honest drawers. Section 138 primarily relates to a civil wrong and the amendment made in the year 2000 specifically made it compoundable. The burden of proof was on the accused in view of presumption under Section 139 of the Act and the standard of proof was of \"preponderance of probabilities\". 14. There is a mandate of presumption of consideration in terms of the provisions of the Act and the onus shifts to the accused on proof of issuance of cheque to rebut the presumption that the cheque was issued not for discharge of any debt or liability in terms of Section 138 of the Act, which reads as under:5. The scope of Section 139 of the Act is that when an accused has to rebut the presumption, the standard of proof for doing so is that of \"preponderance or probabilities\" which has been examined by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Rangappa v. Sri Mohan3, which reads as under:16. It is well settled that the proceedings under Section 138 of the Act are quasi-criminal in nature, and the principles which apply to acquittal in other criminal cases are not applicable in the cases instituted under the Act.17. Likewise, under Section 139 of the Act, a presumption is raised that the holder of a cheque received the cheque for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. To rebut this presumption, facts must be adduced by the accused which on a preponderance of probability (not beyond reasonable doubt as in the case of criminal offences), must then be proved.18. In the case at hand, elucidating from the principles, the complainant was able to prove that the appellant placed the order for purchasing non-woven fabric which was sold vide invoice No. 120 dated 01st October, 2010 and invoice No. 135 dated 16th October, 2010 amounting to Rs.5,07,062/- and Rs.5,10,000/- which was delivered through public carrier truck bearing Nos. HR-38G-5607 and HP-71-0693 and in lieu thereof, the cheques bearing No.323930 dated 15th October, 2010 and No.323935 dated 01st November, 2010 in favour of the complainant were issued by appellant in order to discharge her liability.On the cheques being presented for encashment to the State Bank of India, Branch Kala Amb, the same were dishonoured on the ground of \"insufficient funds\" in the account of the appellant and the same were returned vide memo dated 19th October and 10th November, 2010 by Punjab National Bank, Karnal.19. Thereafter, two separate legal notices were served by the complainant which were duly received by the appellant and even after receiving the said notices, the appellant neither responded to the notices nor made any payment within the statutory period of fifteen days and only thereafter, two separate complaints were filed by the complainant under Section 138 of the Act against the appellant-accused.20. There was no response by the appellant at any stage either when the cheques were issued, or after the presentation to its banker, or when the same were dishonoured, or after the legal notices were served informing the appellant that both the cheques on being presented to its banker were returned with a note that it could not be honoured because of \"insufficient funds\".21. That apart, when the complainant exhibited all these documents in support of his complaints and recorded the statement of three witnesses in support thereof, the appellant has recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code, but failed to record evidence to disprove or rebut the presumption in support of her defence available under Section 139 of the Act. The statement of the accused recorded under Section 313 of the Code is not a substantive evidence of defence, but only an opportunity to the accused to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing in the prosecution case of the accused. Therefore, there is no evidence to rebut the presumption that the cheques were issued for consideration.22. The judgment on which learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance i.e. K. Prakashan v. P.K. Surenderan6may not be of any assistance for the reason that in the case dealing under Section 138 of the Act, the prosecution has to prove the case and these cases being quasi-criminal in nature are to be proved on the basis of the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\", and not on the principles as being examined in the criminal case to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.So far as other case cited by the learned counsel for the appellant i.e. Indus Airways Private Limited and Others v. Magnum Aviation Private Limited and Another7, there was sufficiency of material on record to justify that the cheques were issued as advance payment for purchase of goods, and one of the terms and co-nditions of the contract was that the entire payment would be made to the supplier in advance. However, much within the time, the supplier-complainant received the letter from the purchasers cancelling the purchase orders and requested the supplier to return both the cheques. The supplier pursuant thereto, sent response asking the purchasers as to when the supplier could collect the payment, and only thereafter, the suppler sent a legal notice to the purchasers and filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Act In the given circumstances, it was observed by this Court that the complainant had failed even primafacie that there was a legally enforceable debt or other liability subsisting on the date of drawal of the cheque as contemplated under Section 138 of the Act. . When the matter was earlier heard on 01st March, 2021, we directed the learned counsel for the appellant to seek instructions whether his client is ready to make payment of the stated cheque amount in both the criminal appeals i.e. Rs.5,07,062/- and Rs.5,10,000/- and posted the matter for further hearing on 05th March, 2021. Learned counsel for the appellant on instructions, informed that his client is not willing to discharge the stated amount, and wants to argue the case on merits.After hearing the counsel for both the parties, we reserved the order on 05th March, 2021 and still afforded an opportunity that by 06th March, 2021 evening, the appellant can still re consider her instructions as noticed by us in the order of 01st March, 2021. It has been informed to us that the appellant is interested to get the outcome of the present appeals on merits. Appeal dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9b6d\n**Facts**: . The appellant aggrieved by the order dated 09.02.2009, passed in C.C.No.1837/2008, has filed the present appeal. Brief facts of the case are as under: The appellant, respondent and wife of the respondent - Smt. Nalini A. Prabhu were known to each other for a long time and they are all employees of BHEL, Bengaluru. That the respondent and his wife approached the appellant in the month of January 2005 and requested to lend a sum of Rs.6,00,000/-. The appellant paid a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent in the month of January 2005.  Thereafter, when the appellant demanded to repay the said amount, the respondent issued four cheques bearing Nos.032551, 032552, 032553 and 032554, dated 16.07.2017, amounting to Rs.50,000/- each. The appellant presented the said cheques for encashment and the said cheques were returned on the ground \"insufficient funds\", vide endorsement dated 25.07.2007. After the receipt of endorsement, the appellant issued a legal notice dated 22.08.2007. The said notice was served on the respondent. But the respondent has not replied to the same.  Therefore, the appellant was forced to file a complaint on 26.09.2007, under Section 200 of Cr.P.C., for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('the N.I. Act' for short). The Trial Court recorded the sworn statement of the appellant. Cognizance was taken against the respondent. The respondent, on receiving summons, appeared before the court and was enlarged on bail. He did not plead guilt and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court posted the matter for trial. The appellant, in support of his complaint, got examined himself as PW-1 and three witnesses as PWs. 2 to 4 and got marked 25 documents as Exs.P1 to P13. The respondent, in support of his defense, examined himself as DW-1 and got marked one document as Ex.D1.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The Trial Court, after appreciating the materials on record, acquitted the respondent under Section 255(1) of Cr.P.C. Against the said order, the appellant has filed the present appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant has lent Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent by borrowing the said amount from PWs.2 to 4. The appellant has examined PWs.2 to 4 to prove that he has borrowed money from them and he has got financial capacity to lend the amount. But the Trial Court has failed to consider the evidence of PWs.2 to 4 and also Exs.P18 to 25.\n**Argument by Respondent**: . Learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned order.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: . Heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused the records The appellant has failed to prove that he has got the financial capacity to lend money to the respondent. PW-2, who is related to the appellant, has deposed that he has paid amount to the appellant on various dates in the year 2004. But, PW-2 does not state that the amount alleged to have been paid to the appellant, was advanced to the respondent and in the course of cross- examination, he clearly admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. The evidence of PW-2 does not support the case of the appellant to show that the amount has been advanced by PW-2 to the appellant. Further, PW-3 in his evidence has deposed that the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- and paid the same to the respondent, as the appellant and respondent were close friends. He has further deposed that the appellant has actually borrowed money from other people to arrange and give the same to the respondent. Even PW-3 had also paid a sum of Rs.25,000/- to the appellant. During the course of his cross-examination, PW-3 admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. PW-3 does not disclose the date as on which the alleged amount was paid by him to the appellant.  Coming to the evidence of PW-4, who is said to be an eyewitness to the alleged transaction, he deposes that the alleged transaction took place between the appellant and the respondent in his presence and the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/-, including an amount of Rs.30,000/- paid by PW-4 to the appellant. Even PW-4 does not speak about the date of alleged transaction. During the course of cross- examination, he admits that the appellant is his close friend. The evidence of PWs.2 to 4 do not prove that the appellant has advanced a loan of Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent. If the evidence of PW-1 is perused, it is evident that he himself has borrowed money from Canara Bank and he has not repaid the said amount. Further the appellant has also admitted that he has raised loan from Syndicate Bank and Nikhara Finance. Nikhara Finance had filed a criminal case against him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act and in the said criminal proceedings, the appellant was convicted by imposing fine of Rs.1,00,000/-. He further admits that the said fine amount has been paid by the respondent, on his behalf. Further PW-1 admits that he has borrowed housing loan of Rs.13,00,000/- from SBI, Rajarajeshwari Nagar. In addition, the appellant has admitted that he had borrowed a sum of Rs.1,25,000/- from BHEL Credit Co-op. Society and that he has to pay a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- to Canara Bank towards loan repayment. When the appellant was unable to repay the loan amounts raised by him, question of he advancing loan to the respondent, does not arise. Further the appellant has not explained in the complaint or in the legal notice or in his evidence as to what made him to receive 4 cheques on 16.07.2007. The appellant has admitted in his cross-examination that the respondent and his wife have stood as guarantors for the loan obtained by him from Canara Bank. It clearly goes to show that the alleged cheques were issued by the respondent for security purpose to obtain loan by the appellant, where the respondent and his wife stood as guarantors. The appellant, taking undue advantage, misused the cheques and has filed the present complaint. The appellant in order to prove that he has got financial capacity to lend the amount, has not produced any documents. On the contrary, he has admitted in his cross-examination that he has borrowed money from different financial institutions. He has also admitted that he has not repaid the said amounts. When he himself is a defaulter, question of he advancing the amount to the respondent, does not arise.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The Appellant is guilty of an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and the appeal is DISMISSED.\n\nThe core issue in the case is whether the Appellant is guilty of an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, after the reversal of the finding of acquittal returned by the learned trial Judge.\n\nThe lower court has rightly applied the law and the arguments and evidence presented support the initial ruling. The Appellant issued two cheques for the amount of the invoices after delivery of goods which were dishonoured on the ground of \"insufficient funds\". The non-existence of the debt or liability has not been established by the Appellant. The Appellant did not lead any evidence to disprove or rebut the presumption in defence. The Appellant only recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code. The High Court rightly affirmed that the primary burden was discharged by the complainant that the cheques were issued by the Appellant in lieu of the material supplied, and documentary evidence duly exhibited was placed on record to substantiate the claim.\n\nTherefore, the appeal is DISMISSED."

The appellant Nos. 1 and 2 in Criminal Appeal @ SLP(Criminal) No. 7573 of 2014 and appellant Nos. 2, 3 and 4 in Criminal Appeal @ SLP(Criminal) No. 9520 of 2014 are the Directors of the appellant No. 1(Ameya Paper Mills Pvt. Ltd.) in Criminal Appeal @ SLP(Criminal) No. 9520 of 2014, the Private Limited Company established under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. It is the case of respondent No. 1-complainant that it is a Private Limited Company dealing in the business of production and selling spices under the name and style of M/s. Gharkul Industries Private Ltd. and the appellants being well acquainted with respondent No.1- complainant and being in need of financial assistance for their business approached Respondent no.1-complainant with a request to provide them financial assistance.

It is the further case of the respondent No. 1 that on 18th August 2010, a letter was issued to the appellants demanding balance-sheet of the Company, which was supplied and accordingly accounts were confirmed by the appellants and on 21st June 2012, the appellants issued a letter admitting the outstanding balance of respondent No. 1-complainant as on 31st March, 2012 to the extent of Rs.1,49,94,831/-. According to respondent No. 1, the appellants as Directors of their Company are responsible for conduct of their business and for the affairs of the Company. 7. Appellant No. 1-Company in Criminal Appeal @ SLP(Criminal) No. 9520 of 2014 issued a cheque on 2nd June, 2012 in favour of respondent No. 1complainant towards part payment of the amount valued for Rs. 10,00,000/- drawn on State Bank of India, Finance Branch at Nagpur, Maharashtra which was deposited by respondent No. 1-complainant in UCO Bank, Amravati, Maharashtra for encashment. However, the same was dishonoured due to \"funds insufficient\".  The intimation of dishonour of cheque was received by respondent no. 1-complainant on 4th June, 2012. After dishonour of cheque, notice was issued to the appellants demanding the said amount of cheque, which was refused to be accepted by the appellants in spite of intimation given by the Postal Authorities and, thus, the notice was returned with remark \"not claimed\". 8. In the background of the above facts, respondent No. 1 filed a complaint against the appellants under Section 138 of NI Act in which a specific averment was made that respondent No. 1 by considering the need of the appellants for financial assistance and their relations, provided such financial assistance to the appellants by executing Memorandum of Understanding, which was signed by Appellant no. 2-Dilip Shrikrishna Andhare. It is specifically contended that appellant No. 2 signed the said document with consent of all the remaining appellants in the presence of two attesting witnesses. It is the case of respondent no. 1-complainant as revealed from the complaint that all the appellants agreed that the amount provided by respondent No. 1 would be refunded within one or two years. The contents of the complaint further reveal that respondent No. 1 had demanded balance-sheet of appellant No. 1 Company, which was provided and the appellants also confirmed the balance in their accounts by issuing letter dated 21st June, 2012. The cheque involved in the criminal case initiated by respondent No. 1 against the appellants is dated 2nd June, 2012. It is further averred in para 5 and 7 of the complaint that all Directors of the appellant Company are responsible for its business and all the appellants are involved in the business of the Company and are responsible for all the affairs of the Company.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Ms. Arundhati Katju, learned counsel for the appellants submits that there is no specific averment made that they have committed the offence and are responsible for conduct of business of the Company, which is one of the essential ingredient/requirement and in the absence of such averment, merely because the appellants are the Directors of the Company, they are not to be held vicariously liable and cannot be made accused in the proceedings.  It was further the case of the appellants that no notice relating to dishonour of cheque dated 2nd June, 2012 has been received by them and there is no averment made in the complaint that on the date of issuance of cheque, the appellants were either the Managing Directors or were responsible for day-to-day business of the Company. Mr. Sidhartha Dave, learned senior counsel for the appellants in Criminal Appeal @ SLP(Criminal) No. 7573 of 2014 further submits that they are the non-executive Directors of the Company and were not responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company which is the mandatory requirement for initiation of the proceedings under Section 138 of NI Act and submits that the pre-condition as referred to under Section 141 of NI Act not being complied with, the order passed by the learned trial Judge in summoning the present appellants is nothing but a clear abuse of process of law and the finding which has been recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment is not legally sustainable in law and in support of his submission has placed reliance on the judgments of this Court in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Neeta Bhalla and Another1and Pooja Ravinder Devidasani v. State of Maharashtra and Another2.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n16. Per contra, Mr. Pallav Shishodia, learned senior counsel for the respondents, while supporting the order passed by the High Court in the impugned proceedings, submits that the appellants in Criminal Appeal @ SLP(Criminal) No. 7573 of 2014 claimed themselves to be a non-executive Directors but the record indicates that they are the Directors of the Company and in support thereof, Form No. 32 which has been obtained from the Registrar of Companies placed on record clearly indicates that all are the Directors of the Company as on 1st April 2007 and responsible to the Company for the conduct of business actively involved in the business of the Company and responsible for the affairs of the Company and there is nothing to indicate that they were appointed as non-executive Directors and what is being urged by the learned counsel for the appellants may be their defence which is a matter of trial and is not open to be examined at this stage and once the compliance of the statute has been made as required by law, their petitions have been rightly rejected by the High Court and needs no further indulgence of this Court.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n1. The learned trial Court taking cognizance of the complaint by order dated 10th November, 2012 issued summons to the appellants herein directing them to appear before the Court on 23rd November, 2012 and the appellants were granted bail on furnishing security of Rs.2,000/- by an Order dated 23rd November, 2012 by the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate. 12. The order passed by the learned trial Judge summoning the present appellants came to be challenged in two separate criminal petitions filed under Section 482 CrPC seeking quashing/ setting aside of the criminal complaints/Summary criminal case registered against them as well as the summons dated 10th November, 2012.  Both the petitions were tagged together and came to be dismissed by the High Court under the order impugned dated 18th July, 2014. 17. During the course of submission, learned counsel for the respondents submits that apart from dishonour of cheque in the instant matters, there are other cheques issued by the appellants which were also dishonoured and separate complaints have been filed by the respondent(s) but because of the pendency of the present appeals before this Court, no action has been taken by the trial Judge. The details of the cases including this case are as under: (See Table on Next Page)\n",
    "Case_Result": "9. After contending about the fact of issuance of cheque dated 2nd June, 2012 by the appellants to respondent No. 1 and dishonour of cheque for want of sufficient funds, on receipt of intimation regarding dishonour of cheque on 4th June, 2012, respondent No. 1 issued legal notice to the appellants on the address of Appellant No. 1-Company as well as on their residential address by registered post acknowledgment due on 26th June, 2012 demanding amount of Rs.10 lakhs which is alleged to have been refused by the appellants as per endorsement made by the Postal Department.10. In the light of the above averments in the complaint and documents filed on record, and so also the specific averment made in paragraph 5 and 7 of the complaint that all the appellants are equally responsible for the offence committed by them and they have issued the said cheque to discharge their legal liability towards respondent No. 1-complainant.19. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their assistance perused the material available on record.21. After so stating, the Court analysed Section 141 of the NI Act and after referring to certain other authorities answered a reference which reads as follows:- 19(a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint under Section 141 that at the time the offence was committed, the person accused was in charge of, and responsible for the conduct of business of the company. This averment is an essential requirement of Section 141 and has to be made in a complaint. Without this averment being made in a complaint, the requirements of Section 141 cannot be said to be satisfied. (b) The answer to the question posed in sub-para (b) has to be in the negativeMerely being a director of a company is not sufficient to make the person liable under Section 141 of the Act. A director in a company cannot be deemed to be in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of its business. The requirement of Section 141 is that the person sought to be made liable should be in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time. This has to be averred as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a director in such cases. (c) The answer to Question (c) has to be in the affirmative. The question notes that the managing director or joint managing director would be admittedly in charge of the company and responsible to the company for the conduct of its business. When that is so, holders of such positions in a company become liable under Section 141 of the Act. By virtue of the office they hold as managing director or joint managing director, these persons are in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the company. Therefore, they get covered under Section 141. So far as the signatory of a cheque which is dishonoured is concerned, he is clearly responsible for the incriminating act and will be covered under sub-section (2) of Section 141.\"23. In the light of the ratio in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra) and later judgments of which a reference has been made what is to be looked into is whether in the complaint, in addition to asserting that the appellants are the Directors of the Company and they are incharge of and responsible to the Company for the conduct of the business of the Company and if statutory compliance of Section 141 of the NI Act has been made, it may not open for the High Court to interfere under Section 482 CrPC unless it comes across some unimpeachable, incontrovertible evidence which is beyond suspicion or doubt or totally acceptable circumstances which may clearly indicate that the Director could not have been concerned with the issuance of cheques and asking him to stand the trial would be abuse of process of Court. Despite the presence of basic averment, it may come to a conclusion that no case is made out against the particular Director for which there could be various reasons.We are concerned in this case with Directors who are not signatories to the cheques. So far as Directors who are not the signatories to the cheques or who are not Managing Directors or Joint Managing Directors are concerned, it is clear from the conclusions drawn in the aforestated judgment that it is necessary to aver in the complaint filed under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the NI Act that at the relevant time when the offence was committed, the Directors were in charge of and were responsible for the conduct of the business of the company.26. This averment assumes importance because it is the basic and essential averment which persuades the Magistrate to issue process against the Director. That is why this Court in S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd.(supra) observed that the question of requirement of averments in a complaint has to be considered on the basis of provisions contained in Sections 138 and 141 of the NI Act read in the light of the powers of a Magistrate referred to in Sections 200 to 204 CrPC which recognise the Magistrate's discretion to take action in accordance with law. Thus, it is imperative that if this basic averment is missing, the Magistrate is legally justified in not issuing process.27. In the case on hand, reading the complaint as a whole, it is clear that the allegations in the complaint are that at the time at which the cheques were issued by the Company and dishonoured by the Bank, the appellants were the Directors of the Company and were responsible for its business and all the appellants were involved in the business of the Company and were responsible for all the affairs of the Company. It may not be proper to split while reading the complaint so as to come to a conclusion that the allegations as a whole are not sufficient to fulfil the requirement of Section 141 of the NI Act. The complaint specifically refers to the point of time when the cheques were issued, their presentment, dishonour and failure to pay in spite of notice of dishonour. In the given circumstances, we have no hesitation in overruling the argument made by the learned counsel for the appellants. Appeal dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 636a3909256c9ffed8242c45\n**Facts**: The applicants in all these three revision applications preferred under Section 397 read with Section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (\"the Code\" for short) are the original accused no.3 in Cr. Case Nos.l019/S/1997 to 1021/S/1997 pending in the Court of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, 40th Court, Greater Mumbai (\"the Trial Court\") filed by the respondent no.1 -original complainant for the offence punishable under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (\"the N.I. Act\" for short). Considering the points involved in the three revision applications, on consensus, these revision applications have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment.  Case of the original respondent -complainant M/s. Indusind Enterprises and Finance Limited, is that on the request of the accused, it had discounted Bill of Exchange and that the accused had agreed to pay the entire amount representing the value of the discounted bills, in all cases, by 25.11.1996. The accused No.2, authorized signatory of the cheque for and on behalf of M/s. Atsh Industries Ltd., Mumbai, issued three cheques all dated 25.11.1996 for Rs. 16, 50, 000/ - each being the amount due and payable by the accused no. 1 company towards the amount of bill discounted. The complainant deposited all the three cheques with its bankers for encashment. That the said cheques were dishonoured with the remarks \"refer to drawer\". The complainant thereafter issued notices and called upon all the accused persons to pay the amount of the dishonoured cheques. The notices were accepted by all the accused persons. The same were acknowledged by them but none of them discharged their legal obligation; that is how they failed to comply with the notices issued by the complainant which ultimately resulted in filing complaints under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the N.I. Act against the company, authorized signatory of the cheques (accused no.2) and all other Directors (accused Nos.3 to 8) of the accused no.l company which came to be registered as detailed hereinabove.  The original accused no.3, Kapal Mehra (applicant herein) on service of the process filed application to drop the proceedings against him, contending that there are no averments as required under Section 141 of the N.I. Act to implicate him either in the complaint or in the verification recorded by the learned Magistrate. However, learned Magistrate vide its order dated 4.8.1998 rejected the applications in all three cases. The applicant not being satisfied with the aforesaid orders invoked the revisional jurisdiction of this Court to assail the order on more than one ground. However, the applicant has restricted his submission to the solitary ground reproduced hereinbelow.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The learned Metropolitan Magistrate after receipt of the complaints, after recording verification in each complaint issued separate process against all the accused persons.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Learned counsel appearing for the applicant submits that Section 141 of the N.I. Act is a deeming provision. It says that \"every person who at the time the offence was committed.....\" but nowhere it says that every Director is responsible. In his submission a person could include any person, whether Director or otherwise, who is in-charge of and responsible for the conduct the said company but by no means every Director of a company is included. Every Director cannot be prosecuted for the alleged offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. That the entire Board of Director is not responsible for the alleged offence. According to the learned counsel, it is open for the learned Magistrate issuing process to use provision of Section 202 of the Cr.P.C. to enquire into the matter as to the nature of the offence concerned, to avoid the prosecution against the innocent person. In his submission, so far as vicarious liability under Section 141 of the N.I. Act is concerned, a person should be in-charge of a company and also responsible to the company for it's conduct of the business. Unless both these conditions are fulfilled one cannot be tried under Section 141 of the Act read with Section 138 thereof. . Learned counsel for the applicant while placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Pepsi Foods Ltd. and another Vs. Special Judicial Magistrate and others, 1998 Cr.L.J. 11998 CrLJ 1, contends that the Magistrate has to examine the nature of allegations made in the complaint and the evidence, both oral or documentary, in support thereof, he must apply his mind to consider whether or not the allegations made and evidence brought on record would be sufficient for the complainant to succeed to bring the charge home against the accused. That the Magistrate himself can also put questions to the complainant and his witnesses to elucidate answers to find truthfulness of the allegations made in the complaint. The learned counsel for the applicant after disclosing the above averments submit that the word \"as such\" does not attribute any criminal liability to the present applicant accused or for that purpose other accused persons i.e. including accused Nos.3 to 8, except that they were in-charge and responsible for affairs of the company. He submits that there are no clear cut averments of the fact that the Directors were really in-charge of the affairs of the company as required under Section 141 of the N.I. Act. In his submission, the words \"as such\" indicate that the complainant has merely presumed that the Directors of the company must be guilty because they are holding a particular office.  This argument did not find favour with the learned Magistrate. He, thus, submits that the learned Magistrate committed serious error of law with regard to the burden to be discharged by the accused.  While developing the argument, learned counsel for the applicant has taken me through the various decisions including the decisions referred hereinabove. According to him, there is no averment or allegation either in the notice or in the complaint or even in the verification recorded by the learned Magistrate that the petitioner was actively involved in day to day business or that he was in-charge of the business of the company. Directorship by itself would not make him vicariously liable for any criminal wrong. . The learned Magistrate, while issuing process, has to consider facts stated on oath by the original complainant while verifying contents of the complaint. Firstly, according to him, learned Magistrate ought not to have issued process against the petitioner in the absence of categorical statement or any other relevant convincing, prima facie; evidence leading to the involvement of the applicant-original accused no.3. He further submits that the learned Magistrate ought to have given second look when the application for discharge was moved. He, thus, submits that the impugned order refusing to discharge the applicant is unsustainable in the eye of law and liable to be quashed and set aside.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Learned counsel for the complainant after laying down the aforesaid foundation drew my attention to the averments made in the complaint reproduced herein below:- \"The accused nos.2 to 8 are the Directors of the accused no.1 Company and accused no.3, the signatory of the cheque. As such, the accused No.2 to 8 are therefore responsible for the conduct of the business of the accused no. 1 Company and shall be deemed to be committed an offence u/s. 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act as amended. According to the complainant, all the accused had committed the offence punishable under the provisions of the N.I. Act.\" Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the original complainant tried to support the order and urged that the exact words of Section 141(1) need not be incorporated in the complaint as magic word. In her submission, complaint, as a whole, is required to be looked into and then one has to examine whether the averments made are sufficient to issue process. She also took me through some of the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 to contend that the Director of the Company is supposed to be in-charge of the affairs of the company. She further submits that the view taken by the Court below is a reasonable and possible view and it should not be disturbed in exercise of revisional jurisdiction. Lastly, alternate submission is advanced that, if at all, this Court decides to quash the process against the applicant, in that event, option should be left open with the trial Magistrate that, if he finds on the basis of the evidence led during the trial that the applicant at relevant time was in-charge and responsible for the conduct of business of the company, he should be allowed to proceed against him.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Having heard rival parties and having seen the pleadings in the complaint, no specific allegations have been made against the applicant except the bare statement in para 11 that the accused no.2 to 8 are the Directors of the accused no. 1-company and accused no.3 is the authorized signatory of the cheques. As such, accused no. 2 to 8 are therefore responsible for the conduct of the business of accused no.1 and it shall be deemed that they have committed offence under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the N.I. Act (as amended). Section 141 of the N.I. Act pertains to the vicarious liability. Every Director of the company is not necessarily in-charge of the Company and not responsible for conduct of the business of the Company.  While analysing Section 141 of the N.I. Act, it can be seen that it operates, in cases where an offence under Section 138 of the N.I. Act is committed by a company. The key words which occur in the Section are \"every person\". These are general words and take every person connected with a company within their sweep. Therefore, these words have been rightly qualified by use of the words \"who, at the time the offence was committed, was in-charge of, and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company, shall be deemed to be guilty of the offence etc.\" What is required is that, the persons who are sought to be made criminally liable under Section 141 should at the time the offence was committed, must be in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company. Every person connected with the company shall not fall within the ambit of the provision. It is only those persons who were in charge of and responsible for conduct of business of the company at the time of commission of an offence, who will only be liable for criminal action. It follows from this, that if a director of a Company who was not in charge of and was not responsible for the conduct of the business of the company at the relevant time, will not be liable under the provision. The liability arises from being in charge of and responsible for conduct of business of the company at the relevant time when the offence was committed and not on the basis of merely holding a designation or office in a company. Conversely, a person not holding any office or designation in a Company may be liable if he satisfies the main requirement of being in charge of and responsible for conduct of business of a Company at the relevant time. Liability depends on the role one plays in the affair of a Company and not on designation or status which he holds in the company. A reference to sub-section (2) of Section 141 fortifies the above reasoning because sub-section (2) envisages direct involvement of any Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer of a company in commission of an offence. This section operates when in a trial it is proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or connivance or is attributable to neglect on the part of any of the holders of these officers in a company. In such cases, such persons are to be held liable. Provision has been made for Directors, Managers, Secretaries and other officers of a company to cover them in cases in their proved involvement. The conclusion is inevitable that the liability arises on account of conduct, act or omission on the part of a person and not merely on account of holding an office or a position in a company. Therefore, in order to bring a case within the fold of Section 141 of the Act the complaint must disclose the necessary facts which make a person liable for prosecution. Now, turning to the complaints in hand and the averments made in the pleadings referred to hereinabove indicate that the complainant has merely presumed that the accused no.3 being the Director of the company must be responsible for the conduct of the business of the company. There is not even a whisper nor shred of evidence, apart from presumption drawn in the complaint that there is any act committed by the accused no.3-Director from which reasonable inference can be drawn that he is vicariously liable. In the circumstances, therefore, I am in complete agreement with the argument of the learned counsel for the applicant that no case against the applicant-accused no.3 has been made out expressly on the allegations made in the complaint. Proceedings, therefore, against him are liable to be quashed and set aside. A magistrate issuing process is expected to act meticulously and examine the averments made in the complaint and verification of statement in such or similar cases more carefully, when the prosecution is under special legislation. It is true that the evidence is not required to be pleaded but there has to be a basic averment as to how one is involved in the alleged crime. Although, I uphold the order of the Court below, I would like to state that there are ample provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 in which the Court can take cognizance against persons who have not been made accused and try them in the same manner along with the other accused. In the old Code, Section 351 contained a lacuna in the mode of taking cognizance if a new person has to be added as an accused. The Law Commission in its 41st Report (para 24.81) adverted to this aspect of the law and Section 319 of the present Code gave full effect to the recommendation of the Law Commission by removing the lacuna which was found to exist in Section 351 of the old Code. 28. This provision gives ample powers to any court to take cognizance and add any person not being an accused before it and try him along with the other accused.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The appellants are involved in a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The respondent accused them of committing dishonor of cheques worth over Rs. 1.49 crores. The lower court ruled against the appellants and ordered their summoning. The appellants argue that they are non-executive directors of the company and were not responsible for the conduct of the business actively involved in the business of the company and responsible for the affairs of the company. According to the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Section 141 mandates that the person accused under Section 138 must be shown to have been involved in the business which issued the cheque. The lower court ruled against the appellants without examining this crucial requirement.\n\nThe appeal should be allowed. The lower court erred in not examining the crucial requirement of Section 141 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The appellants' position as non-executive directors of the company is not established, and the Form No. 32 obtained from the Registrar of Companies indicates that they are directors of the company. Without examining this crucial requirement, the lower court's ruling is unsustainable."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. Leave granted. 2. The appellant is aggrieved by the judgment dated 30th April, 2019 passed by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh holding the appellant guilty of offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\") after reversal of the finding of acquittal returned by the learned trial Judge by its judgment dated 28th September, 2012. 3. The brief facts of the case which emanates from the record are that the appellant accused approached the complainant respondent in its factory at Moginand and expressed her desire to purchase non-woven fabric from the complainant. On the basis of order placed by the appellant, non-woven fabric was sold to the appellant vide invoice No.120 dated 01th October, 2010 and invoice No.135 dated 16th October, 2010 amounting to Rs.5,07,062/- and Rs.5,10,000/- which was delivered through public carrier truck bearing Nos. HR-38G-5607 and HP-71-0693 to the appellant accused and in lieu thereof, a cheque bearing No.323930 dated 15th October, 2010 and No.323935 dated 01st November, 2010 were issued by the appellant in the name of the complainant from her account of the Punjab National Bank, Karnal in order to meet the legal existing and enforceable liabilities. The cheques on presentation were returned vide memo dated 19 October, 2010 and 10 November, 2010 from Punjab National Bank, Karnal with a note of \"insufficient funds\" in the account of the appellant.  Two legal notices dated 29th October, 2010 and 19th November, 2010 were sent by the complainant to the appellant on two addresses. The notices were duly served but the appellant neither responded to the notices nor made any payment in furtherance thereto within the statutory period hence, two separate complaints were filed by the complainant respondent under Section 138 of the Act against the appellant accused. 4. The complainant-respondent recorded the preliminary evidence before the learned trial Judge and thereafter, the appellant-accused was directed to be summoned for committing an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act.  After the presence of the appellant had been secured, the learned trial Judge put notice of accusation, vis-a-viz the accused, for an offence allegedly committed by her under Section 138 of the Act whereto she pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 5. The complainant in order to prove its case against the appellant-accused, has examined three witnesses and placed reliance on the documentary evidence which were duly exhibited and referred to in detail by the learned trial Judge in para 3 of its judgment.  On conclusion of recording of complainant's evidence, the statement of the appellant-accused was recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the \"Code\") by the learned trial Judge wherein the appellant-accused claimed innocence and pleaded false implication in the case however, did not lead any evidence in defence.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the complainant was not able to prove that the material/goods were ever sent or received by the appellant and in terms of the complaint, the burden was on the complainant to prove that the material/goods were received by the appellant, against which the cheques were received as security and even though the appellant has not placed any evidence to disprove or rebut the presumption in defence, still the complainant has to discharge its burden and has to stand on his own legs.  In the absence of the prima facie burden being discharged by the complainant, mere issuance of the cheques by the appellant would not have been sufficient to justify that the cheques were issued in discharge of any debt or other liability.  Learned counsel for the appellant further submits that the appellant was able to succeed in creating a doubt in the mind of the court below with regard to the non-existence of the debt or liability, and the learned trial court had returned the finding based on the material available on record.  Unless it was found to be perverse or unsustainable, or a case of non-consideration of any relevant material, the High Court was not justified in reversing and setting aside the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court merely on the ground that the view expressed by the High Court is more plausible with what being expressed by the trial court in its judgment dated 28th September, 2012. 10. Learned counsel for the appellant further submits that the finding recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment is contrary to the settled principles of law as considered by this Court in appreciating the mandate of Sections 118(a), 138 and 139 of the Act. In consequence thereof, the finding of guilt which has been recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment is unsustainable in law, and has to be set aside. Learned counsel for the appellant on instructions, informed that his client is not willing to discharge the stated amount, and wants to argue the case on merits. \nArgument by the Respondent:\n11. Per contra, learned counsel for the complainant-respondent while supporting the finding recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment submitted that there was sufficient material available on record to justify that these cheques were issued with reference to the invoices after delivery of goods, which were duly exhibited, and cheques were issued in lieu thereof. In the sequence of facts, the cheques issued by the appellant, on due presentation to the bank got dishonoured on the ground of \"insufficient funds\".  The statutory notice was issued to the appellant, who failed to respond. The complaints were filed by placing all documentary evidence in support of the complaint duly exhibited, and three witnesses in support thereof were examined, and was able to establish and discharge the burden of proof. It was for the appellant to come forward with her defence, and prove to the contrary as envisaged under Section 139 of the Act.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n6. On perusal of the evidence on record, the learned trial Judge returned a finding that the complainant failed to establish that the material/goods were delivered to the appellant in lieu of which, the cheques were issued, and in the absence of burden being discharged by the complainant, the onus to disprove or rebut the presumption could not be shifted to the appellant as referred under Section 139 of the Act. Accordingly, the trial court returned the finding of acquittal of the appellant, which was the subject matter of challenge in appeal before the High Court at the instance of the complainant. 7. The High Court on reappraisal of the evidence on record affirmed that the primary burden was discharged by the complainant that the cheques were issued by the appellant in lieu of the material supplied, and documentary evidence duly exhibited was placed on record to substantiate the claim, and it was for the appellant-accused to discharge her burden to rebut in defence as required under Section 139 of the Act. In the instant case, the appellant only recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code However, no evidence was recorded to disprove or rebut the presumption in defence. Taking into consideration the overall material on record while setting aside the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial Judge, held that the appellant was guilty of committing an offence under Section 138 of the Act and consequently, awarded appropriate punishment of fine/sentence by the impugned judgment dated 30th April, 2019, which is the subject matter of challenge in appeals before us.\n",
    "Case_Result": "In the instant case, the appellant has only recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code, and has not adduced any evidence to rebut the presumption that the cheques were issued for consideration. Once the facts came on record remained unrebutted and supported with the evidence on record with no substantive evidence of defence of the appellant to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing in the complaint against her, no error has been committed by the High Court in the impugned judgment, and the appellant has been rightly convicted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act and needs no interference of this Court.13. The object of introducing Section 138 and other provisions of Chapter XVII in the Act appears to be to enhance the acceptability of cheques in the settlement of liabilities. The drawer of the cheque be held liable to prosecution on dishonour of cheque with safeguards provided to prevent harassment of honest drawers. Section 138 primarily relates to a civil wrong and the amendment made in the year 2000 specifically made it compoundable. The burden of proof was on the accused in view of presumption under Section 139 of the Act and the standard of proof was of \"preponderance of probabilities\". The N.I. Act including a cheque carrying a presumption of consideration in terms of Sections 118(a) and 139 of the Act which is related to the purpose referred to and reads as under14. There is a mandate of presumption of consideration in terms of the provisions of the Act and the onus shifts to the accused on proof of issuance of cheque to rebut the presumption that the cheque was issued not for discharge of any debt or liability in terms of Section 138 of the Act, which reads as under15. The scope of Section 139 of the Act is that when an accused has to rebut the presumption, the standard of proof for doing so is that of \"preponderance or probabilities\" which has been examined by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Rangappa v. Sri Mohan3, which reads as under:16. It is well settled that the proceedings under Section 138 of the Act are quasi-criminal in nature, and the principles which apply to acquittal in other criminal cases are not applicable in the cases instituted under the Act.17. Likewise, under Section 139 of the Act, a presumption is raised that the holder of a cheque received the cheque for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. To rebut this presumption, facts must be adduced by the accused which on a preponderance of probability (not beyond reasonable doubt as in the case of criminal offences), must then be proved. 18. In the case at hand, elucidating from the principles, the complainant was able to prove that the appellant placed the order for purchasing non-woven fabric which was sold vide invoice No. 120 dated 01st October, 2010 and invoice No. 135 dated 16th October, 2010 amounting to Rs.5,07,062/- and Rs.5,10,000/- which was delivered through public carrier truck bearing Nos. HR-38G-5607 and HP-71-0693 and in lieu thereof, the cheques bearing No.323930 dated 15th October, 2010 and No.323935 dated 01st November, 2010 in favour of the complainant were issued by appellant in order to discharge her liability. On the cheques being presented for encashment to the State Bank of India, Branch Kala Amb, the same were dishonoured on the ground of \"insufficient funds\" in the account of the appellant and the same were returned vide memo dated 19th October and 10th November, 2010 by Punjab National Bank, Karnal.19. Thereafter, two separate legal notices were served by the complainant which were duly received by the appellant and even after receiving the said notices, the appellant neither responded to the notices nor made any payment within the statutory period of fifteen days and only thereafter, two separate complaints were filed by the complainant under Section 138 of the Act against the appellant-accused.20. There was no response by the appellant at any stage either when the cheques were issued, or after the presentation to its banker, or when the same were dishonoured, or after the legal notices were served informing the appellant that both the cheques on being presented to its banker were returned with a note that it could not be honoured because of \"insufficient funds\".21. That apart, when the complainant exhibited all these documents in support of his complaints and recorded the statement of three witnesses in support thereof, the appellant has recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code, but failed to record evidence to disprove or rebut the presumption in support of her defence available under Section 139 of the Act. The statement of the accused recorded under Section 313 of the Code is not a substantive evidence of defence, but only an opportunity to the accused to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing in the prosecution case of the accused. Therefore, there is no evidence to rebut the presumption that the cheques were issued for consideration.22. The judgment on which learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance i.e. K. Prakashan v. P.K. Surenderan6may not 6 (2008) 1 SCC 258 : AIROnline 2007 SC 340. be of any assistance for the reason that in the case dealing under Section 138 of the Act, the prosecution has to prove the case and these cases being quasi-criminal in nature are to be proved on the basis of the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\", and not on the principles as being examined in the criminal case to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. So far as other case cited by the learned counsel for the appellant i.e. Indus Airways Private Limited and Others v. Magnum Aviation Private Limited and Another7, there was sufficiency of material on record to justify that the cheques were issued as advance payment for purchase of goods, and one of the terms and co-nditions of the contract was that the entire payment would be made to the supplier in advance. However, much within the time, the supplier-complainant received the letter from the purchasers cancelling the purchase orders and requested the supplier to return both the cheques. The supplier pursuant thereto, sent response asking the purchasers as to when the supplier could collect the payment, and only thereafter, the suppler sent a legal notice to the purchasers and filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Act. In the given circumstances, it was observed by this Court that the complainant had failed even primafacie that there was a legally enforceable debt or other liability subsisting on the date of drawal of the cheque as contemplated under Section 138 of the Act. This judgment would not be of any help to the appellant in the instant case.23. When the matter was earlier heard on 01st March, 2021, we directed the learned counsel for the appellant to seek instructions whether his client is ready to make payment of the stated cheque amount in both the criminal appeals i.e. Rs.5,07,062/- and Rs.5,10,000/- and posted the matter for further hearing on 05th March, 2021After hearing the counsel for both the parties, we reserved the order on 05th March, 2021 and still afforded an opportunity that by 06th March, 2021 evening, the appellant can still re consider her instructions as noticed by us in the order of 01st March, 2021. It has been informed to us that the appellant is interested to get the outcome of the present appeals on merits. Appeal dismissed",

The appellant aggrieved by the order dated 09.02.2009, passed in C.C.No.1837/2008, has filed the present appeal. Brief facts of the case are as under: The appellant, respondent and wife of the respondent - Smt. Nalini A. Prabhu were known to each other for a long time and they are all employees of BHEL, Bengaluru. That the respondent and his wife approached the appellant in the month of January 2005 and requested to lend a sum of Rs.6,00,000/-. The appellant paid a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent in the month of January 2005.  Thereafter, when the appellant demanded to repay the said amount, the respondent issued four cheques bearing Nos.032551, 032552, 032553 and 032554, dated 16.07.2017, amounting to Rs.50,000/- each. The appellant presented the said cheques for encashment and the said cheques were returned on the ground \"insufficient funds\", vide endorsement dated 25.07.2007. After the receipt of endorsement, the appellant issued a legal notice dated 22.08.2007. The said notice was served on the respondent. But the respondent has not replied to the same.  Therefore, the appellant was forced to file a complaint on 26.09.2007, under Section 200 of Cr.P.C., for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('the N.I. Act' for short). The Trial Court recorded the sworn statement of the appellant. Cognizance was taken against the respondent. The respondent, on receiving summons, appeared before the court and was enlarged on bail. He did not plead guilt and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court posted the matter for trial. The appellant, in support of his complaint, got examined himself as PW-1 and three witnesses as PWs. 2 to 4 and got marked 25 documents as Exs.P1 to P13. The respondent, in support of his defense, examined himself as DW-1 and got marked one document as Ex.D1.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The Trial Court, after appreciating the materials on record, acquitted the respondent under Section 255(1) of Cr.P.C. Against the said order, the appellant has filed the present appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant has lent Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent by borrowing the said amount from PWs.2 to 4. The appellant has examined PWs.2 to 4 to prove that he has borrowed money from them and he has got financial capacity to lend the amount. But the Trial Court has failed to consider the evidence of PWs.2 to 4 and also Exs.P18 to 25.\n**Argument by Respondent**: . Learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned order.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: . Heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused the records The appellant has failed to prove that he has got the financial capacity to lend money to the respondent. PW-2, who is related to the appellant, has deposed that he has paid amount to the appellant on various dates in the year 2004. But, PW-2 does not state that the amount alleged to have been paid to the appellant, was advanced to the respondent and in the course of cross- examination, he clearly admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. The evidence of PW-2 does not support the case of the appellant to show that the amount has been advanced by PW-2 to the appellant. Further, PW-3 in his evidence has deposed that the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- and paid the same to the respondent, as the appellant and respondent were close friends. He has further deposed that the appellant has actually borrowed money from other people to arrange and give the same to the respondent. Even PW-3 had also paid a sum of Rs.25,000/- to the appellant. During the course of his cross-examination, PW-3 admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. PW-3 does not disclose the date as on which the alleged amount was paid by him to the appellant.  Coming to the evidence of PW-4, who is said to be an eyewitness to the alleged transaction, he deposes that the alleged transaction took place between the appellant and the respondent in his presence and the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/-, including an amount of Rs.30,000/- paid by PW-4 to the appellant. Even PW-4 does not speak about the date of alleged transaction. During the course of cross- examination, he admits that the appellant is his close friend. The evidence of PWs.2 to 4 do not prove that the appellant has advanced a loan of Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent. If the evidence of PW-1 is perused, it is evident that he himself has borrowed money from Canara Bank and he has not repaid the said amount. Further the appellant has also admitted that he has raised loan from Syndicate Bank and Nikhara Finance. Nikhara Finance had filed a criminal case against him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act and in the said criminal proceedings, the appellant was convicted by imposing fine of Rs.1,00,000/-. He further admits that the said fine amount has been paid by the respondent, on his behalf. Further PW-1 admits that he has borrowed housing loan of Rs.13,00,000/- from SBI, Rajarajeshwari Nagar. In addition, the appellant has admitted that he had borrowed a sum of Rs.1,25,000/- from BHEL Credit Co-op. Society and that he has to pay a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- to Canara Bank towards loan repayment. When the appellant was unable to repay the loan amounts raised by him, question of he advancing loan to the respondent, does not arise. Further the appellant has not explained in the complaint or in the legal notice or in his evidence as to what made him to receive 4 cheques on 16.07.2007. The appellant has admitted in his cross-examination that the respondent and his wife have stood as guarantors for the loan obtained by him from Canara Bank. It clearly goes to show that the alleged cheques were issued by the respondent for security purpose to obtain loan by the appellant, where the respondent and his wife stood as guarantors. The appellant, taking undue advantage, misused the cheques and has filed the present complaint. The appellant in order to prove that he has got financial capacity to lend the amount, has not produced any documents. On the contrary, he has admitted in his cross-examination that he has borrowed money from different financial institutions. He has also admitted that he has not repaid the said amounts. When he himself is a defaulter, question of he advancing the amount to the respondent, does not arise.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case is whether the appellant is guilty of committing an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The lower court ruled against the appellant, holding that the appellant is guilty of committing an offence under Section 138 of the Act.\n\nThe lower court's judgment appears to be incorrectly applied. The burden of proof lies with the complainant to establish that the cheques were issued by the appellant in lieu of the material supplied. In the instant case, the appellant only recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code. No evidence was recorded to disprove or rebut the presumption in defence. Since the complainant failed to discharge the burden of proof, the lower court's decision should be reversed.\n\nThe appeal should be allowed, as the lower court's decision is unsustainable in law."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. Dayashankar Chaurasia, the respondent issued eight (8) cheques of Rs.20,000/- each totalling to Rs.1,60,000/- in favour of M/s. Bell Marshall Telesystems Limited (for short 'the Company'). The cheques were drawn on HDFC Bank, Vasai (E) Branch, Mumbai. These cheques were drawn on different dates but were presented together for payment on 10.05.2006. All the cheques got dishonoured on account of \"funds insufficient\" as per Bank Memos issued on 12.05.2006. On the cheques being dishonoured, legal notices were issued by the beneficiary under Section 138(b) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the 'NI Act') on 26.05.2006. The demand was, however not met within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the notice nor was any reply sent which resulted in the complaint bearing No.160/SS/07 being filed on 07.07.2006 by Mr. Bhupesh Rathod before the Special Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai. The complaint was accompanied by a Board Resolution of the Company dated 17.05.2006 authorising Mr. Bhupesh Rathod to initiate legal action against the respondent on behalf of the Company. On 24.12.2007, the Company filed an affidavit through its Managing Director, i.e., Mr. Bhupesh Rathod, stating that it had authorised him through the abovementioned Board Resolution to file a complaint case against the respondent. 2. In view of the fact that much turns on the manner of description of the complainant, we reproduce the description of the complainant as under: \"Mr. Bhupesh M. Rathod Managing Director of M/s. Bell Marshall Telesystems Ltd. Aged: 41 years, Occupation: Business Having address at 1107, V Maker Chamber, Nariman Point Mumbai- 400021.\" 3. The Board Resolution passed on 17.05.2006 is in the following terms: \"RESOLVED THAT legal action be initiated against Dayashankar Prasad Choursiya for the dishonour of chqs issued by him and in discharge of this liabilities to the company and Mr. Bhupesh Rathod/Sashikant Ganekar is hereby authorized to appoint advocates, issues of notices through advocate, file complaint, Verifications on Oath, appoint Constituent attorney to file complaint in the court and attend all such affairs which may be needed in the process of legal actions.\" For Bell Marshal Tele Systems LTD. Sd/- Dated: 17/05/2006 Director\" 4. We reproduce the aforesaid as the competency and the manner of filing of the complaint are the primary considerations debated before us.\\n\\n5. The case made out in the complaint is that a sum of Rs.1,60,000/- was advanced to the respondent by the Company and the cheques were issued to repay the loan. The respondent took an objection that the complaint was filed in the personal capacity of Mr. Bhupesh Rathod and not on behalf of the Company. While on the other hand it was contended by the appellant that the complaint was in the name of the Company and in the cause title of the complaint he had described himself as the Managing Director. The Company was a registered company under the Companies Act, 1956. The registration certificate, however, was not placed on record. On this aspect, it was the further submission of the respondent that it is only in the aforesaid title description that the complainant is described as the Managing Director of the Company but in the body of the complaint it is not so mentioned. . It may be relevant to note that the High Court traversed many paths while coming to this conclusion. In a nutshell the reasoning was: (a) it could not be said that the complaint had been filed by a payee or holder in due course as mandated under Section 142(a) of the NI Act; (b) the payee was the Company and a perusal of the complaint did not show that the complaint was filed by the Company.  It had been filed by the appellant who had described himself as the Managing Director of the Company only in the cause title of the complaint; (c) probably a conscious choice was made to not file the complaint in the name of the Company as it was unclear whether the Company was authorised to advance loans. 9. We may note that the High Court did not give its imprimatur to the entire reasoning of the trial court as it noticed that the demand notice was sent on behalf of the Company. Thus, the Company was aware that the complaint had to be filed by the Company itself. It was observed that the aforesaid aspect was probably left vague on purpose by the Company and therefore, it was opined that the complaint had not been filed by the payee in terms of Section 142 of the NI Act. Complainant's/Appellant's submissions:\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n10. The appellant contended before us that it was quite apparent from the cause title of the complaint which is an integral part of the complaint, that the same had been filed on behalf of the Company. It was further contended that this was the reason that the Board Resolution authorising the Managing Director to file a complaint for dishonour of the cheques was annexed. The address given was of the Company, which was the registered office address. The affidavit filed in the cross-examination in pursuance thereto left no manner of doubt that the complaint was filed as the Managing Director of the Company. . It is the say of the appellant that there is a presumption under Section 139 and 118 of the NI Act which was not rebutted by the respondent. It was further contended that a duly signed cheque was sufficient to raise a presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act against the respondent as held in Triyambak S. Hegde v. Sripad1. 1. Crl. Appeal Nos. 849-850/2011 decided on 23.09.2021.\\n\\n12. It was submitted that a very hyper technical view of the matter had been taken and it only related to the format of the filing of the complaint and not the substance. The trial court itself had accepted that the complaint was filed on behalf of the Company as otherwise it would have refused to take cognizance under Section 142(a) of the NI Act. \nArgument by the Respondent:\n It was not the say of the respondent in defence that the cheque was not signed by him or was signed under any fraud or misrepresentation. he respondent had not even challenged the summoning order on the ground that the complaint is not filed on behalf of the Company. Respondent's submissions: 13. Learned counsel for the respondent, however, contended that the appellant had failed to prove his case beyond reasonable doubt and the complaint itself was not in a proper form. The complaint and the Board Resolution did not lead to a conclusion that it was filed on behalf of the Company. The Board Resolution was also not signed by the Directors of the Company nor does it find that it authorises the complainant to file the complaint. 14. The respondent also contended that no loan was advanced by the Company nor has it been proved as to whose account the alleged loan was advanced to. No loan agreement in favour of the Company was placed on record. Our View:\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n. The trial court acquitted the respondent on 12.03.2009 based on a dual reasoning - (a) there was no document except the promissory note signed by the respondent to show that the loan was being granted; and (b) the Board Resolution itself was not signed by the Board of Directors (it may be stated that this was really a true copy of the Board Resolution). 7. The appellant preferred an appeal before the High Court. The High Court by the impugned order dated 03.08.2015 dismissed the appeal.\n",
    "Case_Result": "15. We have examined the submissions of the learned counsel for the partieWe must say at the inception that the respondent not having disputed his signatures on the cheques, it was for the respondent to show in what circumstances the cheques had been issued, i.e., why was it not a cheque issued in due course. The words of Section 139 of the NI Act are quite clear that unless the contrary is proved, it shall be presumed that the holder of the cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in Section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. The respondent has not set up a case that the nature of transaction was of the nature which fell beyond the scope of Section 138. Other than taking a technical objection, really nothing has been said on the substantive aspect.18. The only eligibility criteria prescribed under Section 142(1)(a) is that the complaint must be by the payee or the holder in due course.19. In the conspectus of the aforesaid principles we have to deal with the plea of the respondent that the complaint was not filed by the competent complainant as it is the case that the loan was advanced by the Company. As to what would be the governing principles in respect of a corporate entity which seeks to file the complaint, an elucidation can be found in the judgment of this Court in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. Keshavanand2. If a complaint was made in the name of the Company, it is necessary that a natural person represents such juristic person in the court and the court looks upon the natural person for all practical purposes. It is in this context that observations were made that the body corporate is a de jure complainant while the human being is a de facto complainant to represent the former in the court proceedings. Thus, no Magistrate could insist that the particular person whose statement was taken on oath alone can continue to represent the Company till the end of the proceedings. Not only that, even if there was initially no authority the Company can at any stage rectify that defect by sending a competent person.21. We find that the judicial precedents cited aforesaid have been breached by the Courts below. The High Court also embarked on a discussion as to the vagueness of the identity of the complainant and its relation with the legality of a loan which may be granted by the Company, something that was not required to be gone into.22. If we look at the format of the complaint which we have extracted aforesaid, it is quite apparent that the Managing Director has filed the complaint on behalf of the Company.There could be a format where the Company's name is described first, suing through the Managing Director but there cannot be a fundamental defect merely because the name of the Managing Director is stated first followed by the post held in the Company.23. It is also relevant to note that a copy of the Board Resolution was filed along with the complaint. An affidavit had been brought on record in the trial court by the Company, affirming to the factum of authorisation in favour of the Managing Director. A Manager or a Managing Director ordinarily by the very nomenclature can be taken to be the person in-charge of the affairs Company for its day-to-day management and within the activity would certainly be calling the act of approaching the court either under civil law or criminal law for setting the trial in motion4.It would be too technical a view to take to defeat the complaint merely because the body of the complaint does not elaborate upon the authorisation. The artificial person being the Company had to act through a person/official, which logically would include the Chairman or Managing Director. Only the existence of authorisation could be verified.24. While we turn to the authorisation in the present case, it was a copy and, thus, does not have to be signed by the Board Members, as that would form a part of the minutes of the Board meeting and not a true copy of the authorisation. We also feel that it has been wrongly concluded that the Managing Director was not authorised. If we peruse the authorisation in the form of a certified copy of the Resolution, it states that legal action has to be taken against the respondent for dishonour of cheques issued by him to discharge his liabilities to the Company. To this effect, Mr. Bhupesh Rathod/Sashikant Ganekar were authorised to appoint advocates, issues notices through advocate, file complaint, verifications on oath, appoint Constituent attorney to file complaint in the court and attend all such affairs which may be needed in the process of legal actions. What more could be said?25. The finding by the Courts below as to the lack of authorisation to depose also, thus, stands nullified.26. The description of the complainant with its full registered office address is given at the inception itself except that the Managing Director's name appears first as acting on behalf of the Company. The affidavit and the cross-examination in respect of the same during trial supports the finding that the complaint had been filed by the Managing Director on behalf of the Company. Thus, the format itself cannot be said to be defective though it may not be perfect. The body of the complaint need not be required to contain anything more in view of what has been set out at the inception coupled with the copy of the Board Resolution. There is no reason to otherwise annex a copy of the Board Resolution if the complaint was not being filed by the appellant on behalf of the Company.27. In our view, one of the most material aspects is, as stated aforesaid, that the signatures on the cheques were not denied. Neither was it explained by way of an alternative story as to why the duly signed cheques were handed over to the Company. There was no plea of any fraud or misrepresentation. It does, thus, appear that faced with the aforesaid position, the respondent only sought to take a technical plea arising from the format of the complaint to evade his liability. There was no requirement of a loan agreement to be executed separately as any alternative nature of transaction was never stated. Conclusion: Appeal allowed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e972e\n**Facts**: 2. The petitioner is facing a complaint filed by the respondent under Section 138, 141 & 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on the allegations that the petitioner issued a cheque of Rs. 60 lacs in favour of the respondent for valid consideration. The said cheque bearing no. 784074 dated 30.09.1994 was dishonored on presentation by the bankers of the petitioners with the remarks \"funds insufficient\". The complainant/ respondent then issued a legal notice to the petitioner dated 07.10.1994 informing the petitioner about the dishonor of the aforesaid cheque and calling upon him to pay the amount of cheque within a period of 15 days of the receipt of said legal notice. Since the petitioner failed to make the payment, the respondent after waiting for the statutory period of 30 days filed a complaint in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate in which the petitioner was summoned to face the trial. 3. Before filing the aforesaid complaint the respondent also made a complaint to the CBI on 23.06.1995 against the petitioner & 3 others and on that basis an FIR was registered by the CBI bearing No. RC 50 (A)/95-DLI. The said complaint reads as under:\n\n\"The Superintendent of Police, CBI, Anti Corruption Branch-I, Block 4, C.G.O. Complex, Lodhi Road, New Delhi-3. Sir, this is to bring to your notice on 21.3.1994 Shri Vijay Borar of Borar & Co., Chartered Accountant, New Delhi approached us for discounting a trade bill of exchange of Rs. 60 lacs drawn by Kay Bee & Co., on Radhika Leather Fashions, New Delhi with the proposal of Mr. Borar as looking to the amount of the bill we wanted to collateral security. Mr. Borar assured that this bill and the obligations there under would be met with on due date because he had arranged a confirmation from the Chief Manager, State Bank of Saurashtra, Lodhi Road affirming the commitment of meeting obligation by the Bank on due date also. The bill of exchange was accepted and co-accepted for payment by Mr. R.P.Mathur, Prop. Radhika Leather Fashions and the Chief Manager, State Bank kof Saurashtra. State Bank of Saurashtra also issued a certificate dated 24.3.1994 confirming that Mr. R.P.Mathur, Prop. Radhika Leather Fashions has a running Credit limit of Rs. 2075 crores with the Bank and the amount will be paid on due date. Further, on 30.3.1994, the Chief Manager of Saurashtra conformed to us that the payment will be made on the due date i.e. 30.9.1994. On the basis of aforesaid representation and assurance by Mr. Vijay Borar, Mr. R.P.Mathur, the Chief Manager of State Bank of Saurashtra we discounted the aforesaid bill of exchange. ON 3.9.1994 the bill of exchange was due for payment but on presentation the cheque given to us for making repayment on the bill was dishonoured and when we tried to meet Mr. R.P.Mathur, of RAdhika Leather Fashions we were told that he is out of India. Mr. Vijay Borar told us that State Bank of Saurashtra being the co-acceptor is bound for their commitment but despite our best efforts no payment was made by Bank of Saurashtra. Again we along with the Notary Public approached the Bank and requested for payment against the bill of exchange, but no payment was made and even Bank of Saurashtra refused to accept the legal notice. Thus, it is apparent that the gang of four viz. Mr. V.B.Borar of Borar & Co., and Chief Manager of State Bank of Saurashtra jointly conspired and connived to commit fraud on our company with an intention to cheat our Company and misappropriate the amount of Rs. 60 lacs amongst themselves and succeeded in their motives. We request you to kindly take immediate action against the culprits.\" 4. In the above said case FIR and also a challan has been filed and the matter is pending investigation and trial before the Court after the filing of the Complaint under Section 138 of the N.I. ACT.\"\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 1. By way of the present petition the petitioners have invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court vested in this Court under Section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and have made the following prayers:\n\na) quash criminal complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 against Petitioner pending before the Court of Ms Anuradha Shukla, MM, New Delhi entitled as \"SRP Industries Ltd vs. R P Mathur, Prop. Radhika Leather Fashions\".\n\nb) and/or alternatively quash warrant case emanating out of FIR No. RC, 50 (A)/95-DLI dated 23.6.1995 with Central Bureau of Investigation;\n\nc) and/or otherwise pass such further orders and grant relief that the Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper under the facts and circumstances of the case. 5. After the receipt of the summons in the complaint subject matter of this petition the petitioner filed an application before the Metropolitan Magistrate for recalling of the summoning order in the said complaint bearing No. 865/01 which as stated above is the Complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which has been dismissed vide order dated 15.03.2004. It has been held that the proceedings taken out by the respondents under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and the complaint registered by the CBI makes out two independent set of offences which are distinct and as such there was no occasion to recall of the summons under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Relevant observations made in the aforesaid order are reproduced hereunder:\n\n12. In the instant matter admittedly although a FIR has been registered the accused under Section 420/477A/120B Indian Penal Code, 1860, the trial in the said case is still going on and accused has neither been convicted or acquitted as yet and as such the applicability of double jeopardy cannot be pleaded in the facts of the instant case. Even if this aspect is not considered at this stage, in view of the categorical judgment of the Apex Court in the judgments cited by the Ld. Counsel for the complainant, it has been specifically held that where the ingredients of two offences are different, the prosecution in the two cases can be held separately in spite of the fact that the two offences emanate from the same transaction\n\n13. In the case in hand, the applicant is asserting that in view of FIR registered against him under Section 420/477A/120B Indian Penal Code, 1860, the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is not maintainable. However, a bare perusal of the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 would indicate that it has very specific ingredients as specified herein above being issuance of cheque, dishonor thereof, issuance of legal notice and filing of complaint within the period of limitation. However, section 420/477A/120B Indian Penal Code, 1860 requires the element of dishonesty, inducement, falsification, fraud etc.\n\n14. Thus a bare perusal of the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and Section 420/477/120B would reveal that the accused ingredients of the two offences are distinct and as such in view of the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court cited hereinabove, the prosecution of the accused under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 cannot be considered to be barred by the prosecution under section 420/477/120B Indian Penal Code, 1860 in State cases as regards the arguments of Ld. Counsel regarding cheque having not been issued for valid consideration, Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is very clear when it lays down that there shall be presumption in favour of complainant if the cheque is issued in his favour that the same was issued for valid consideration. The accused if he alleges that there was no valid consideration can rebut the allegation at the stage of trial. However, this cannot be considered as this stage a ground for recalling the summons.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: 6. The Petitioner has submitted that while filing the complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 the respondent has not brought to the notice of the Court that he has also filed a complaint with the CBI and, thus, concealed material facts. It is also submitted that on comparative study of the complaint made by Respondent to CBI, and the averments made in complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, it is clear that cheque in question is the foundation of both the cases emanating and originating out of series of same acts and transaction which are also subject matter of above referred CBI case and is not a case simplicitor of payment/discharge of liability of debt. It is submitted that continuation of the complaint despite filing of a challan by the CBI on the basis of FIR on the complaint of the respondent under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 tantamount to prosecuting the petitioner at two places for the same cause of action and amounts to double jeopardy. It is also submitted that the Magistrate wrongly dismissed his application for recalling the summons. It has been submitted that for the same cause of action two different Courts cannot proceed with the trial. 7. The petitioner has also alleged that even otherwise the complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is liable to be quashed, because in the complaint filed in the aforementioned complaint the respondent has not disclosed the true facts and that facts narrated in complaint under Section 420 Indian Penal Code, 1860 which render the averments made in complaint as false. Moreover, the subject cheque is without consideration and is stated to have been issued to back up the bill of exchange which was co-accepted by State Bank of Saurashtra who certified the cheque as good for payment and therefore it was the said bank who was the accused and not the Petitioner. Resultantly ingredients of Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 are not made out and as such, complaint under Section 138 is neither competent nor maintainable.\n**Argument by Respondent**: 8. In the counter affidavit filed by the respondent/complainant it has been submitted that the petition filed by the petitioner is mala-fide and without any merits. It is stated that the inherent powers of this Court can only be exercised in circumstances which are rarest for the purpose of meeting the ends of justice, and it is not a case where such interference is called for. Relying upon the judgment of the Apex Court, delievered in the case of Dhariwal Tobaco Products Ltd. and Ors. Vs. State Of Maharashtra & Anr 2008 (16) SCALE 240, it has been submitted that the powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can only be exercised in a deserving case within parameters of law whereas in the present case nothing has been shown by the respondent that there is any reason to exercise such powers and therefore it has been prayed that the petition be dismissed with costs. . It has also been submitted that while exercising powers under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 this Court cannot act as a Court of Appeal inasmuch as by the present petition the petitioner only wants to assail the order passed by the Learned Metropolitan Magistrate in complaint case no. 865/2001 dated 15.03.2004. 9. Dealing with the submissions made by the petitioner relying upon the Article 20(2) of the Constitution Of India, 1950 alleging double jeopardy just because he is called upon to face the prosecution based upon the FIR registered by the CBI and to meet the allegation made in the complaint it has been averred that it is not a case where the petitioner is being tried for the same offence in two different forums. It is submitted that the charges against the petitioner as recited in the FIR are distinct and different from the offence said to have been committed by the petitioner on account of the cheque having been issued by him getting dishonored on presentation. Admittedly, the petitioner has been charged under Section 420, 477A read with Section 120 B of Indian Penal Code, 1860 in the FIR registered against him whereas he has been prosecuted under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 before the Trial Court on the same set of facts. Moreover, it is further submitted that the petitioner at no point of time had denied the issuance of cheque, the dishonoring of the Cheque which triggered the criminal prosecution before the Trial Court. It is also stated that in view of the issuance of cheque by the petitioner, the presumption under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 comes into operation which can only be rebutted during the course of the Trial and cannot be decided in a proceedings under Section 482 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973. It is also submitted that the second prosecution on similar set of facts are not barred if the ingredients of the two offences are distinct. Respondent also stated that the rule against double jeopardy is manifested in Section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, Section 300 of Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and Section 71 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which unequivocally held initiation of prosecution on the same set of facts provided these fulfill the ingredients of offences distinct and different. It is submitted that both the complaints against the petitioner though are emanating from the same set of facts but they do fulfill the vital and mandatory requirement for the purpose of launching prosecution against the petitioner for two distinct offences. Moreover the prayer sought by the petitioner is not borne out from the facts recited in the petition as the prayer in terms of clause B is not a subject matter before this Court and it unambiguously manifests the ulterior objective of the petitioner to resort to dilatory tactics by raising objections extraneous and frivolous in nature.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions. A bare perusal of thecomplaint on the basis of which an FIR has been registered by the CBI goes to show that the offences for which the petitioner and others have been put in that case are not on account of dishonouring of cheque of Rs. 60 lacs but for cheating the complainant in seeking discounting of a trade bill for exchange of Rs. 60 lacs drawn by Kay Bee & Co., on Radhika Leather Fashions, New Delhi for which a collateral security was arranged from the Chief Manager State Bank of Saurashtra. It is on the basis of the aforesaid commitment the bill of exchange was accepted and co-accepted for payment by Mr. R.P.Mathur, Prop. Radhika Leather Fashions and the Chief Manager State Bank of Saurashtra for which a certificate was also issued on 24.03.2005 confirming that the R.P.Mathur, Proprietor Radhika Fashion had a running credit limit of Rs. 2.75 crores and as such the amount will be paid on due date and an assurance was given that when the Bills will be presented they will be honoured. However, on 03.09.1994 when the bill of exchange was due for payment and a cheque was given to the complainant for making repayment that bill was dishonoured. Thus, thecomplaint is based upon a false assurance that the bill of exchange would be accepted on presentation which was not done. The assurance that petitioner was having a credit limit for State Bank of Saurashtra as confirmed by the said bank was also found to be false. The fact of dishonour of the cheque constitute a separate offence in view of the provisions contained under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881which provides for a separate/additional remedy in respect of dishonouring of the cheque so as to save the commercial transactions and to grant some kind of protection to the people who relies upon payment made by way of cheques. 12. I have also gone through the judgment relied upon by the petitioner in the case of G. Sagar Suri & Anr. Vs. State of U.P and Others (supra) but find that the judgment is not of any help to the petitioner on the facts of this case. Rather this case helps the respondent. In the said case it was held that:\n\n\"10. the inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the High Court to act according to whim or caprice and that statutory power has to be exercised sparingly, with circumspection and in the rarest of rare cases. \"\" 14. Even otherwise the plea of Double Jeopardy is pre-mature because in this case, the petitioner has not yet been convicted in either of the cases. The plea of double jeopardy can be only be invoked when a person is convicted for the same offence twice 15. Having perused the order passed by the Metropolitan Magistrate which has also been challenged in this petition I find that there is absolutely no infirmity in the said order because the learned trial Court has brought the distinction between the two set of offences and has rightly dealt with the issue raised of double jeopardy which in this case is not applicable. 16. I also agree with the submissions made by the respondents that it is not a case where provisions under Section 482 Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 can be invoked. This extract is taken from State of Bihar v. Murad Ali Khan, (1988) 4 SCC 655, at page 666 : 18. In the same judgment the Apex Court also relied upon another judgment delivered in the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs. R.K. Rohtagi (1983) 1 SCC 1 where it was said:\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue of the case is whether the lower court correctly ruled that the appellant failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the complaint was not in a proper form. The lower court acquitted the respondent based on the lack of a loan agreement and the Board Resolution not being signed by the Directors. In light of Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, Section 138, we assess the lower court's judgment. The appellant's case was that the complaint was filed on behalf of the Company as evident from the cause title, address given, and affidavit filed in the cross-examination. The Board Resolution authorizing the Managing Director to file a complaint for dishonour of the cheques was also annexed. Triyambak S. Hegde v. Sripad1 supports the presumption under Section 139 and 118 of the NI Act against the respondent. The lower court's decision was based on a hyper technical view of the complaint's format and ignoring the substance. The respondent failed to challenge the summoning order on the ground that the complaint is not filed on behalf of the Company. Therefore, the appeal should be ALLOWED."

    "JudgmentDate": "10/02/2021",
    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. Leave Granted. 2. M/s. Kalamani Tex (Appellant No.1) and its managing partner-B. Subramanian (Appellant No.2) are in appeal challenging the judgment dated 09.11.2017 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Madras, whereby the order of acquittal of the Judicial Magistrate, Tiruppur was reversed and the appellants have been convicted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (in short, 'NIA'). Consequently, Appellant No.2 has been sentenced to undergo three months Simple Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5,000/-. 3. The instant proceedings have originated out of a complaint preferred by P. Balasubramanian (Complainant-Respondent) against the appellants. The respondent is the proprietor of a garment company named and styled as 'Growell International', which along with Appellant No.1 was engaged in a business arrangement, whereby they agreed to jointly export garments to France. Certain issues arose regarding delays in shipment and payment from the buyer, due to which, the appellants had to pay the respondent a sum of Rs. 11.20 lakhs. To that end, Appellant No.2 issued a cheque on behalf of Appellant No. 1 bearing no.897993 dated 07.11.2000 in favour of the respondent and also executed a Deed of Undertaking on the same day wherein Appellant No.2 personally undertook to pay the respondent in lieu of the initial expenditure incurred by the latter. The respondent presented the said cheque to the bank on 29.12.2000 for collection but it was returned with an endorsement that there were insufficient funds in the account of appellants. In wake of the cheque being dishonoured, the respondent issued a notice dated 08.01.2001 asking the appellants to pay the amount within 15 days. The appellants in their reply dated 27.01.2001 denied their liability and claimed that blank cheques and signed blank stamp papers were issued to help the respondent in some debt recovery proceedings, and not because of any legally enforceable debt. 4. The respondent then lodged a private complaint under section 138 and 142 of the NIA read with Section 200 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short 'CrPC') before the Judicial Magistrate, Tiruppur. In order to substantiate his claim, the respondent himself entered the witness box and produced documentary evidence such as the cheque issued by Appellant No.2. The respondent in his chief-examination initially contended that the subject amount had been received by the appellants from the foreign buyer. However, when recalled on a later date, the respondent produced the Deed of Undertaking dated 07.11.2000, whereunder, the 2nd Appellant had acknowledged the liability towards respondent. One PS Shanmugham (PW-2) who was working as Manager in State Bank of India, Tiruppur Overseas Branch, was also examined by the respondent. 5. Appellant No.2 in his statement under Section 313 CrPC plainly denied the allegations and disputed the existence of any liability towards the respondent. The appellants also examined one V. Rajagopal (DW-1) who at the relevant time was working as Assistant Manager in State Bank of India, Tiruppur Overseas Branch. DW-1 mainly deposed on the inability of the respondent to pay back the credit that was advanced to him, and the subsequent debt recovery proceedings initiated against him. The appellants did not lead any documentary evidence in their defence. 8. The aggrieved appellants are now before this Court. It may be mentioned at the outset that when the SLP came up for hearing on 12.03.2018, their learned Counsel agreed to deposit the entire amount in dispute and in deference thereto, the appellants have on 11.04.2018 deposited a sum of Rs. 11.20 lakhs with the Registry of this Court.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n9. Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants, nonetheless, desired to argue the case on merits and contended that there was no legally enforceable liability on the date of issuance of the cheque and that blank stamp papers signed by Appellant No.2 were misused by the respondent to forge the Deed of Undertaking dated 07.11.2000. Placing reliance on Murugesan v. State Through Inspector of Police (2012) 10 SCC 383, \u00b6 32., he urged that the view taken by the trial Court was a possible view, and the High Court committed patent illegality and exceeded its jurisdiction in reversing the acquittal. Learned Senior Counsel also cited Reena Hazarika v. State of Assam (2019) 13 SCC 289, \u00b6 20. to argue that the High Court did not take notice of the defence raised by the appellants which has caused serious prejudice to them. He passionately put forth the principles laid down in Basalingappa v. Mudibasapp (2019) 5 SCC 418. and Kumar Exports v. Sharma Carpets (2009) 2 SCC 513., and submitted that the presumption drawn against an accused under Section 118 and Section 139 of the NIA is rebuttable through a standard of \"preponderance of probability\", which has been successfully met by the appellants in the present case.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n10. On the other hand, learned Counsel for the respondent maintained that the decision of the High Court is well reasoned and founded upon due consideration of all relevant factors of the case. Laying stress on the undisputed signatures on the cheque and the Deed of Undertaking dated 07.11.2000, he asserted that the appellants have admitted their existing liability of Rs. 11.20 lakhs. Lastly, while pointing out the financial loss suffered by the respondent and the adverse impact on his business, learned Counsel prayed for suitable compensation.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n6. The trial Court disbelieved the respondent's claim and observed that he had failed to establish a legally enforceable liability on the date of issue of cheque. The Court held that since the basic ingredients of an offence under Section 138 of the NIA were not satisfied, the complaint was liable to be dismissed. 7. Discontented with the order of the trial Court, the respondent preferred a criminal appeal before the High Court, wherein, the Court noted that Appellant No.2 had admitted his signatures on both the Cheque and the Deed of Undertaking and had thus acknowledged the appellants' liability. The High Court therefore vide impugned judgment allowed the criminal appeal and convicted both the appellants under Section 138 of NIA. Appellant No. 2 was awarded a sentence of three months simple imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 5,000/- (or 20 days simple imprisonment in lieu thereof). Additionally, Appellant No.1 was directed to pay a fine of Rs. 5,000/-, in default of which, Appellant No. 2 would undergo another one-month simple imprisonment.\n",
    "Case_Result": "12. Having given our thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions, we do not find any valid ground to interfere with the impugned judgment. It is true that the High Court would not reverse an order of acquittal merely on formation of an opinion different than that of the trial Court. It is also trite in law that the High Court ought to have compelling reasons to tinker with an order of acquittal and no such interference would be warranted when there were to be two possible conclusions. CK Dasegowda and Others v. State of Karnatak, (2014) 13 SCC 119 \u00b614. Nonetheless, there are numerous decisions of this Court, justifying the invocation of powers by the High Court under Section 378 CrPC, if the trial Court had, inter alia, committed a patent error of law or grave miscarriage of justice or it arrived at a perverse finding of fact. State of UP v. Banne, (2009) 4 SCC 271,\u00b6 27; Ghurey Lal v. State of U.P., (2008) 10 SCC 450, \u00b670.13. On a similar analogy, the powers of this Court under Article 136 of the Constitution also do not encompass the re-appreciation of entirety of record merely on the premise that the High Court has convicted the appellants for the first time in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction. This Court in Ram Jag v. State of UP (1974) 4 SCC 201, \u00b6 14., Rohtas v. State of Haryana (2019) 10 SCC 554, \u00b6 12. and Raveen Kumar v. State of Himachal Pradesh 2020 SCC Online SC 869, \u00b6 149, evolved its own limitations on the exercise of powers under Article 136 of the Constitution and has reiterated that while entertaining an appeal by way of special leave, there shall not ordinarily be an attempt to re-appreciate the evidence on record unless the decision(s) under challenge are shown to have committed a manifest error of law or procedure or the conclusion reached is ex-facie perverse.14. Adverting to the case in hand, we find on a plain reading of its judgment that the trial Court completely overlooked the provisions and failed to appreciate the statutory presumption drawn under Section 118 and Section 139 of NIA.The Statute mandates that once the signature(s) of an accused on the cheque/negotiable instrument are established, then these 'reverse onus' clauses become operative. In such a situation, the obligation shifts upon the accused to discharge the presumption imposed upon him. 15. Once the 2nd Appellant had admitted his signatures on the cheque and the Deed, the trial Court ought to have presumed that the cheque was issued as consideration for a legally enforceable debt. The trial Court fell in error when it called upon the Complainant-Respondent to explain the circumstances under which the appellants were liable to pay. Such approach of the trial Court was directly in the teeth of the established legal position as discussed above, and amounts to a patent error of law.16. No doubt, and as correctly argued by senior counsel for the appellants, the presumptions raised under Section 118 and Section 139 are rebuttable in nature. As held in MS Narayana Menon v. State of Kerela (2006) 6 SCC 39, \u00b6 32., which was relied upon in Basalingappa (supra), a probable defence needs to be raised, which must meet the standard of \"preponderance of probability\", and not mere possibility.These principles were also affirmed in the case of Kumar Exports (supra), wherein it was further held that a bare denial of passing of consideration would not aid the case of accused.17. The appellants have banked upon the evidence of DW-1 to dispute the existence of any recoverable debt. However, his deposition merely highlights that the respondent had an over-extended credit facility with the bank and his failure to update his account led to debt recovery proceedings. Such evidence does not disprove the appellants' liability and has a little bearing on the merits of the respondent's complaint. Similarly, the appellants' mere bald denial regarding genuineness of the Deed of Undertaking dated 07.11.2000, despite admitting the signatures of Appellant No. 2 thereupon, does not cast any doubt on the genuineness of the said document. Even if we take the arguments raised by the appellants at face value that only a blank cheque and signed blank stamp papers were given to the respondent, yet the statutory presumption cannot be obliterated.19. Considering the fact that there has been an admitted business relationship between the parties, we are of the opinion that the defence raised by the appellants does not inspire confidence or meet the standard of 'preponderance of probability'In the absence of any other relevant material, it appears to us that the High Court did not err in discarding the appellants' defence and upholding the onus imposed upon them in terms of Section 118 and Section 139 of the NIA.20. As regard to the claim of compensation raised on behalf of the respondent, we are conscious of the settled principles that the object of Chapter XVII of the NIA is not only punitive but also compensatory and restitutive. The provisions of NIA envision a single window for criminal liability for dishonour of cheque as well as civil liability for realisation of the cheque amount. It is also well settled that there needs to be a consistent approach towards awarding compensation and unless there exist special circumstances, the Courts should uniformly levy fine up to twice the cheque amount along with simple interest at the rate of 9% per annum. R. Vijian v. Baby, (2012) 1 SCC 260 \u00b620.21. The respondent, nevertheless, cannot take advantage of the above cited principles so as to seek compensation. The record indicates that neither did the respondent ask for compensation before the High Court nor has he chosen to challenge the High Court's judgment. Since, he has accepted the High Court's verdict, his claim for compensation stands impliedly overturned. The respondent, in any case, is entitled to receive the cheque amount of Rs. 11.20 lakhs which the appellant has already deposited with the Registry of this Court. Appeal dismissed",

The appellant aggrieved by the order dated 09.02.2009, passed in C.C.No.1837/2008, has filed the present appeal. Brief facts of the case are as under: The appellant, respondent and wife of the respondent - Smt. Nalini A. Prabhu were known to each other for a long time and they are all employees of BHEL, Bengaluru. That the respondent and his wife approached the appellant in the month of January 2005 and requested to lend a sum of Rs.6,00,000/-. The appellant paid a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent in the month of January 2005.  Thereafter, when the appellant demanded to repay the said amount, the respondent issued four cheques bearing Nos.032551, 032552, 032553 and 032554, dated 16.07.2017, amounting to Rs.50,000/- each. The appellant presented the said cheques for encashment and the said cheques were returned on the ground \"insufficient funds\", vide endorsement dated 25.07.2007. After the receipt of endorsement, the appellant issued a legal notice dated 22.08.2007. The said notice was served on the respondent. But the respondent has not replied to the same.  Therefore, the appellant was forced to file a complaint on 26.09.2007, under Section 200 of Cr.P.C., for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('the N.I. Act' for short). The Trial Court recorded the sworn statement of the appellant. Cognizance was taken against the respondent. The respondent, on receiving summons, appeared before the court and was enlarged on bail. He did not plead guilt and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court posted the matter for trial. The appellant, in support of his complaint, got examined himself as PW-1 and three witnesses as PWs. 2 to 4 and got marked 25 documents as Exs.P1 to P13. The respondent, in support of his defense, examined himself as DW-1 and got marked one document as Ex.D1.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The Trial Court, after appreciating the materials on record, acquitted the respondent under Section 255(1) of Cr.P.C. Against the said order, the appellant has filed the present appeal.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant has lent Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent by borrowing the said amount from PWs.2 to 4. The appellant has examined PWs.2 to 4 to prove that he has borrowed money from them and he has got financial capacity to lend the amount. But the Trial Court has failed to consider the evidence of PWs.2 to 4 and also Exs.P18 to 25.\n**Argument by Respondent**: . Learned counsel for the respondent supports the impugned order.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: . Heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties and perused the records The appellant has failed to prove that he has got the financial capacity to lend money to the respondent. PW-2, who is related to the appellant, has deposed that he has paid amount to the appellant on various dates in the year 2004. But, PW-2 does not state that the amount alleged to have been paid to the appellant, was advanced to the respondent and in the course of cross- examination, he clearly admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. The evidence of PW-2 does not support the case of the appellant to show that the amount has been advanced by PW-2 to the appellant. Further, PW-3 in his evidence has deposed that the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- and paid the same to the respondent, as the appellant and respondent were close friends. He has further deposed that the appellant has actually borrowed money from other people to arrange and give the same to the respondent. Even PW-3 had also paid a sum of Rs.25,000/- to the appellant. During the course of his cross-examination, PW-3 admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. PW-3 does not disclose the date as on which the alleged amount was paid by him to the appellant.  Coming to the evidence of PW-4, who is said to be an eyewitness to the alleged transaction, he deposes that the alleged transaction took place between the appellant and the respondent in his presence and the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/-, including an amount of Rs.30,000/- paid by PW-4 to the appellant. Even PW-4 does not speak about the date of alleged transaction. During the course of cross- examination, he admits that the appellant is his close friend. The evidence of PWs.2 to 4 do not prove that the appellant has advanced a loan of Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent. If the evidence of PW-1 is perused, it is evident that he himself has borrowed money from Canara Bank and he has not repaid the said amount. Further the appellant has also admitted that he has raised loan from Syndicate Bank and Nikhara Finance. Nikhara Finance had filed a criminal case against him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act and in the said criminal proceedings, the appellant was convicted by imposing fine of Rs.1,00,000/-. He further admits that the said fine amount has been paid by the respondent, on his behalf. Further PW-1 admits that he has borrowed housing loan of Rs.13,00,000/- from SBI, Rajarajeshwari Nagar. In addition, the appellant has admitted that he had borrowed a sum of Rs.1,25,000/- from BHEL Credit Co-op. Society and that he has to pay a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- to Canara Bank towards loan repayment. When the appellant was unable to repay the loan amounts raised by him, question of he advancing loan to the respondent, does not arise. Further the appellant has not explained in the complaint or in the legal notice or in his evidence as to what made him to receive 4 cheques on 16.07.2007. The appellant has admitted in his cross-examination that the respondent and his wife have stood as guarantors for the loan obtained by him from Canara Bank. It clearly goes to show that the alleged cheques were issued by the respondent for security purpose to obtain loan by the appellant, where the respondent and his wife stood as guarantors. The appellant, taking undue advantage, misused the cheques and has filed the present complaint. The appellant in order to prove that he has got financial capacity to lend the amount, has not produced any documents. On the contrary, he has admitted in his cross-examination that he has borrowed money from different financial institutions. He has also admitted that he has not repaid the said amounts. When he himself is a defaulter, question of he advancing the amount to the respondent, does not arise.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "**1. Issue and Lower Court Judgment**\n\nThe main issue in this case is whether the lower court correctly ruled on the conviction of the appellants under Section 138 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act (NIA) based on the evidence presented. The lower court disbelieved the respondent's claim and dismissed the complaint, stating that the basic ingredients of the offence were not satisfied. However, the High Court allowed the respondent's appeal, convicting both appellants under Section 138 of NIA.\n\n**2. Critical Analysis**\n\nThe core legal question is whether the appellants have been rightly convicted under Section 138 of NIA based on the evidence available. This section deals with dishonour of a cheque issued by the drawer on an account maintained with a bank for payment of any amount, knowing that he has insufficient funds in that account for the payment of the entire amount of the cheque.\n\nThe lower court disbelieved the respondent's claim and held that the basic ingredients of an offence under Section 138 of NIA were not satisfied. The court observed that the appellants had failed to establish a legally enforceable liability on the date of the cheque's issue.\n\nHowever, the High Court allowed the respondent's appeal, convicting both appellants under Section 138 of NIA. The High Court noted that Appellant No. 2 admitted his signatures on both the cheque and the Deed of Undertaking, thereby acknowledging the appellants' liability.\n\nIn the given case, the cheque issued by Appellant No. 2 was dishonoured due to insufficient funds in the account. The respondent had issued a notice asking the appellants to pay the amount within 15 days, which was denied by the appellants. The respondent produced the Deed of Undertaking dated 07.11.2000, where Appellant No. 2 personally undertook to pay the respondent in lieu of the initial expenditure incurred by the latter.\n\nThe respondent's claim that the appellants had a legally enforceable liability on the date of the cheque's issue is supported by the Deed of Undertaking. The appellants' signatures on the cheque and the Deed of Undertaking further strengthen this claim.\n\nIn light of the above, the lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint appears to be incorrect. The evidence presented by the respondent supports the basic ingredients of an offence under Section 138 of NIA.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the appeal should be allowed. The lower court incorrectly dismissed the complaint against the appellants. The appellants should not have been convicted under Section 138 of NIA based on the evidence presented in the case.\n\nOutput: ALLOWED"

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. Leave granted. 2. The appellant is aggrieved by the judgment dated 30th April, 2019 passed by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh holding the appellant guilty of offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Act\") after reversal of the finding of acquittal returned by the learned trial Judge by its judgment dated 28th September, 2012. 3. The brief facts of the case which emanates from the record are that the appellant accused approached the complainant-respondent in its factory at Moginand and expressed her desire to purchase non-woven fabric from the complainant. On the basis of order placed by the appellant, non-woven fabric was sold to the appellant vide invoice No.120 dated 01st October, 2010 and invoice No.135 dated 16th October, 2010 amounting to Rs. 5,07,062/- and Rs. 5,10,000/- which was delivered through public carrier truck bearing Nos. HR-38G-5607 and HP-71-0693 to the appellant accused and in lieu thereof, a cheque bearing No.323930 dated 15th October, 2010 and No.323935 dated 01st November, 2010 were issued by the appellant in the name of the complainant from her account of the Punjab National Bank, Karnal in order to meet the legal existing and enforceable liabilities. The cheques on presentation were returned vide memo dated 19th October, 2010 and 10th November, 2010 from Punjab National Bank, Karnal with a note of \"insufficient funds\" in the account of the appellant. Two legal notices dated 29th October, 2010 and 19th November, 2010 were sent by the complainant to the appellant on two addresses. The notices were duly served but the appellant neither responded to the notices nor made any payment in furtherance thereto within the statutory period hence, two separate complaints were filed by the complainant-respondent under Section 138 of the Act against the appellant-accused. 4. The complainant-respondent recorded the preliminary evidence before the learned trial Judge and thereafter, the appellant-accused was directed to be summoned for committing an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act. After the presence of the appellant had been secured, the learned trial Judge put notice of accusation, vis-a-viz the accused, for an offence allegedly committed by her under Section 138 of the Act whereto she pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The complainant in order to prove its case against the appellant-accused, has examined three witnesses and placed reliance on the documentary evidence which were duly exhibited and referred to in detail by the learned trial Judge in para 3 of its judgment. On conclusion of recording of complainant's evidence, the statement of the appellant-accused was recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the \"Code\") by the learned trial Judge wherein the appellant-accused claimed innocence and pleaded false implication in the case however, did not lead any evidence in defence. 6. On perusal of the evidence on record, the learned trial Judge returned a finding that the complainant failed to establish that the material/goods were delivered to the appellant in lieu of which, the cheques were issued, and in the absence of burden being discharged by the complainant, the onus to disprove or rebut the presumption could not be shifted to the appellant as referred under Section 139 of the Act.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the complainant was not able to prove that the material/goods were ever sent or received by the appellant and in terms of the complaint, the burden was on the complainant to prove that the material/goods were received by the appellant, against which the cheques were received as security and even though the appellant has not placed any evidence to disprove or rebut the presumption in defence, still the complainant has to discharge its burden and has to stand on his own legs. n the absence of the prima-facie burden being discharged by the complainant, mere issuance of the cheques by the appellant would not have been sufficient to justify that the cheques were issued in discharge of any debt or other liability. In support of his submission, learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on the judgment of this Court in K. Prakashan vs. P.K. Surenderan (2008) 1 SCC 258 and Indus Airways Private Limited and Others Vs. Magnum Aviation Private Limited and Another (2014) 12 SCC 539. Learned counsel for the appellant further submits that the appellant was able to succeed in creating a doubt in the mind of the court below with regard to the non-existence of the debt or liability, and the learned trial court had returned the finding based on the material available on record. Unless it was found to be perverse or unsustainable, or a case of non-consideration of any relevant material, the High Court was not justified in reversing and setting aside the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court merely on the ground that the view expressed by the High Court is more plausible with what being expressed by the trial court in its judgment dated 28th September, 2012. . Learned counsel for the appellant further submits that the finding recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment is contrary to the settled principles of law as considered by this Court in appreciating the mandate of Sections 118(a), 138 and 139 of the Act. In consequence thereof, the finding of guilt which has been recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment is unsustainable in law, and has to be set aside.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nPer contra, learned counsel for the complainant-respondent while supporting the finding recorded by the High Court in the impugned judgment submitted that there was sufficient material available on record to justify that these cheques were issued with reference to the invoices after delivery of goods, which were duly exhibited, and cheques were issued in lieu thereof. In the sequence of facts, the cheques issued by the appellant, on due presentation to the bank got dishonoured on the ground of \"insufficient funds\" The statutory notice was issued to the appellant, who failed to respond. The complaints were filed by placing all documentary evidence in support of the complaint duly exhibited, and three witnesses in support thereof were examined, and was able to establish and discharge the burden of proof. It was for the appellant to come forward with her defence, and prove to the contrary as envisaged under Section 139 of the Act.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nAccordingly, the trial court returned the finding of acquittal of the appellant, which was the subject matter of challenge in appeal before the High Court at the instance of the complainant. 7. The High Court on reappraisal of the evidence on record affirmed that the primary burden was discharged by the complainant that the cheques were issued by the appellant in lieu of the material supplied, and documentary evidence duly exhibited was placed on record to substantiate the claim, and it was for the appellant-accused to discharge her burden to rebut in defence as required under Section 139 of the Act. In the instant case, the appellant only recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code.  However, no evidence was recorded to disprove or rebut the presumption in defence. Taking into consideration the overall material on record while setting aside the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial Judge, held that the appellant was guilty of committing an offence under Section 138 of the Act and consequently, awarded appropriate punishment of fine/sentence by the impugned judgment dated 30th April, 2019, which is the subject matter of challenge in appeals before us.\n",
    "Case_Result": ". In the instant case, the appellant has only recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code, and has not adduced any evidence to rebut the presumption that the cheques were issued for consideration. Once the facts came on record remained unrebutted and supported with the evidence on record with no substantive evidence of defence of the appellant to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing in the complaint against her, no error has been committed by the High Court in the impugned judgment, and the appellant has been rightly convicted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Act and needs no interference of this Court.The object of introducing Section 138 and other provisions of Chapter XVII in the Act appears to be to enhance the acceptability of cheques in the settlement of liabilities. The drawer of the cheque be held liable to prosecution on dishonour of cheque with safeguards provided to prevent harassment of honest drawers. Section 138 primarily relates to a civil wrong and the amendment made in the year 2000 specifically made it compoundable. The burden of proof was on the accused in view of presumption under Section 139 of the Act and the standard of proof was of \"preponderance of probabilities\". here is a mandate of presumption of consideration in terms of the provisions of the Act and the onus shifts to the accused on proof of issuance of cheque to rebut the presumption that the cheque was issued not for discharge of any debt or liability in terms of Section 138 of the Act, which reads as under:-. The scope of Section 139 of the Act is that when an accused has to rebut the presumption, the standard of proof for doing so is that of \"preponderance or probabilities\" which has been examined by a three-Judge Bench of this Court in Rangappa vs. Sri Mohan (2010) 11 SCC 441, which reads as under:-16. It is well settled that the proceedings under Section 138 of the Act are quasi-criminal in nature, and the principles which apply to acquittal in other criminal cases are not applicable in the cases instituted under the Act.17. Likewise, under Section 139 of the Act, a presumption is raised that the holder of a cheque received the cheque for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. To rebut this presumption, facts must be adduced by the accused which on a preponderance of probability (not beyond reasonable doubt as in the case of criminal offences), must then be proved.It was further considered by this Court in Uttam Ram vs. Devinder Singh Hudan and Another (2019) 10 SCC 287.18. In the case at hand, elucidating from the principles, the complainant was able to prove that the appellant placed the order for purchasing non-woven fabric which was sold vide invoice No. 120 dated 01st October, 2010 and invoice No. 135 dated 16th October, 2010 amounting to Rs. 5,07,062/- and Rs. 5,10,000/- which was delivered through public carrier truck bearing Nos. HR-38G-5607 and HP-71-0693 and in lieu thereof, the cheques bearing No.323930 dated 15th October, 2010 and No.323935 dated 01st November, 2010 in favour of the complainant were issued by appellant in order to discharge her liability. On the cheques being presented for encashment to the State Bank of India, Branch Kala Amb, the same were dishonoured on the ground of \"insufficient funds\" in the account of the appellant and the same were returned vide memo dated 19th October and 10th November, 2010 by Punjab National Bank, Karnal.19. Thereafter, two separate legal notices were served by the complainant which were duly received by the appellant and even after receiving the said notices, the appellant neither responded to the notices nor made any payment within the statutory period of fifteen days and only thereafter, two separate complaints were filed by the complainant under Section 138 of the Act against the appellant-accused.20. There was no response by the appellant at any stage either when the cheques were issued, or after the presentation to its banker, or when the same were dishonoured, or after the legal notices were served informing the appellant that both the cheques on being presented to its banker were returned with a note that it could not be honoured because of \"insufficient funds\".21. That apart, when the complainant exhibited all these documents in support of his complaints and recorded the statement of three witnesses in support thereof, the appellant has recorded her statement under Section 313 of the Code, but failed to record evidence to disprove or rebut the presumption in support of her defence available under Section 139 of the Act. The statement of the accused recorded under Section 313 of the Code is not a substantive evidence of defence, but only an opportunity to the accused to explain the incriminating circumstances appearing in the prosecution case of the accused. Therefore, there is no evidence to rebut the presumption that the cheques were issued for consideration.\n\n22. The judgment on which learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance i.e. K. Prakashan vs. P.K. Surenderan (2008) 1 SCC 258 may not be of any assistance for the reason that in the case dealing under Section 138 of the Act, the prosecution has to prove the case and these cases being quasi-criminal in nature are to be proved on the basis of the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\", and not on the principles as being examined in the criminal case to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. So far as other case cited by the learned counsel for the appellant i.e. Indus Airways Private Limited and Others Vs. Magnum Aviation Private Limited and Another (2014) 12 SCC 539, there was sufficiency of material on record to justify that the cheques were issued as advance payment for purchase of goods, and one of the terms and conditions of the contract was that the entire payment would be made to the supplier in advance.However, much within the time, the supplier-complainant received the letter from the purchasers cancelling the purchase orders and requested the supplier to return both the cheques. The supplier pursuant thereto, sent response asking the purchasers as to when the supplier could collect the payment, and only thereafter, the suppler sent a legal notice to the purchasers and filed a complaint under Section 138 of the Act. In the given circumstances, it was observed by this Court that the complainant had failed even prima-facie that there was a legally enforceable debt or other liability subsisting on the date of drawal of the cheque as contemplated under Section 138 of the Act. This judgment would not be of any help to the appellant in the instant case.23. When the matter was earlier heard on 01st March, 2021, we directed the learned counsel for the appellant to seek instructions whether his client is ready to make payment of the stated cheque amount in both the criminal appeals i.e. Rs. 5,07,062/- and Rs. 5,10,000/- and posted the matter for further hearing on 05th March, 2021. Learned counsel for the appellant on instructions, informed that his client is not willing to discharge the stated amount, and wants to argue the case on merits. After hearing the counsel for both the parties, we reserved the order on 05th March, 2021 and still afforded an opportunity that by 06th March, 2021 evening, the appellant can still re-consider her instructions as noticed by us in the order of 01st March, 2021. It has been informed to us that the appellant is interested to get the outcome of the present appeals on merits. Appeals Dismissed",

PW-2, who is related to the appellant, has deposed that he has paid amount to the appellant on various dates in the year 2004. But, PW-2 does not state that the amount alleged to have been paid to the appellant, was advanced to the respondent and in the course of cross- examination, he clearly admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. The evidence of PW-2 does not support the case of the appellant to show that the amount has been advanced by PW-2 to the appellant. Further, PW-3 in his evidence has deposed that the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/- and paid the same to the respondent, as the appellant and respondent were close friends. He has further deposed that the appellant has actually borrowed money from other people to arrange and give the same to the respondent. Even PW-3 had also paid a sum of Rs.25,000/- to the appellant. During the course of his cross-examination, PW-3 admits that he does not possess any document to show that he has paid the amount to the appellant. PW-3 does not disclose the date as on which the alleged amount was paid by him to the appellant.  Coming to the evidence of PW-4, who is said to be an eyewitness to the alleged transaction, he deposes that the alleged transaction took place between the appellant and the respondent in his presence and the appellant arranged a sum of Rs.5,50,000/-, including an amount of Rs.30,000/- paid by PW-4 to the appellant. Even PW-4 does not speak about the date of alleged transaction. During the course of cross- examination, he admits that the appellant is his close friend. The evidence of PWs.2 to 4 do not prove that the appellant has advanced a loan of Rs.5,50,000/- to the respondent. If the evidence of PW-1 is perused, it is evident that he himself has borrowed money from Canara Bank and he has not repaid the said amount. Further the appellant has also admitted that he has raised loan from Syndicate Bank and Nikhara Finance. Nikhara Finance had filed a criminal case against him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act and in the said criminal proceedings, the appellant was convicted by imposing fine of Rs.1,00,000/-. He further admits that the said fine amount has been paid by the respondent, on his behalf. Further PW-1 admits that he has borrowed housing loan of Rs.13,00,000/- from SBI, Rajarajeshwari Nagar. In addition, the appellant has admitted that he had borrowed a sum of Rs.1,25,000/- from BHEL Credit Co-op. Society and that he has to pay a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- to Canara Bank towards loan repayment. When the appellant was unable to repay the loan amounts raised by him, question of he advancing loan to the respondent, does not arise. Further the appellant has not explained in the complaint or in the legal notice or in his evidence as to what made him to receive 4 cheques on 16.07.2007. The appellant has admitted in his cross-examination that the respondent and his wife have stood as guarantors for the loan obtained by him from Canara Bank. It clearly goes to show that the alleged cheques were issued by the respondent for security purpose to obtain loan by the appellant, where the respondent and his wife stood as guarantors. The appellant, taking undue advantage, misused the cheques and has filed the present complaint. The appellant in order to prove that he has got financial capacity to lend the amount, has not produced any documents. On the contrary, he has admitted in his cross-examination that he has borrowed money from different financial institutions. He has also admitted that he has not repaid the said amounts. When he himself is a defaulter, question of he advancing the amount to the respondent, does not arise.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED. \n\nThe lower court's decision to reverse the finding of acquittal and hold the appellant guilty under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is not sustainable. The complainant failed to prove that material/goods were ever sent or received by the appellant, and the burden of doing so lay with them. The mere issuance of cheques by the appellant does not suffice to prove her guilt under the Act. The appellant successfully created a doubt in the mind of the court below regarding the non-existence of debt or liability, and the trial court's finding of acquittal is not perverse or unsustainable. The High Court erred in reversing this finding and setting aside the acquittal. The appeal is allowed, and the finding of guilt recorded by the High Court is set aside."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. Steel products were supplied by the respondent to one M/s. Diamond Engineering Pvt. Ltd. [\"the company\"] from 21.09.2015 to 11.11.2016, as a result of which INR 24,20,91,054/- was due and payable by the company.  As many as 51 cheques were issued by the company in favour of the respondent towards amounts payable for supplies, all of which were returned dishonoured for the reason \"funds insufficient\" on 03.03.2017. As a result, on 31.03.2017, the respondent issued a statutory demand notice under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, calling upon the company and its three Directors, the appellants no.1-3 herein, to pay this amount within 15 days of the receipt of the notice.  On 28.04.2017, two cheques for a total amount of INR 80,70,133/- presented by the respondent for encashment were returned dishonoured for the reason \"funds insufficient\". A second demand notice dated 05.05.2017 was therefore issued under the selfsame Sections by the respondent, calling upon the company and the appellants to pay this amount within 15 days of the receipt of the notice. 3. Since no payment was forthcoming pursuant to the two statutory demand notices, two criminal complaints, being Criminal Complaint No.SS/552/2017 and Criminal Complaint No. SS/690/2017 dated 17.05.2017 and 21.06.2017, respectively, were filed by the respondent against the company and the appellants under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate [\"ACMM\"], Kurla, Mumbai. On 12.02.2018, summons were issued by the ACMM to the company and the appellants in both the criminal complaints. Meanwhile, as a statutory notice under Section 8 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 [\"IBC\"] had been issued on 21.03.2017 by the respondent to the company, and as an order dated 06.06.2017 was passed by the Adjudicating Authority admitting the application under Section 9 of the IBC and directing commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process with respect to the company, a moratorium in terms of Section 14 of the IBC was ordered. In an appeal filed before this Court, on 26.10.2018, this Court ordered a stay of further proceedings in the two complaints pending before the learned ACMM. On 30.09.2019, since a resolution plan submitted by the promoters of the company had been approved by the committee of creditors, the Adjudicating Authority approved such plan as a result of which, the moratorium order dated 06.06.2017 ceased to have effect. It may only be added that at present, an application for withdrawal of approval of this resolution plan has been filed by the financial creditors of the company before the Adjudicating Authority.   Equally, an application to extend time for implementation of this plan has been filed by the resolution applicant sometime in October 2020 before the Adjudicating Authority. Both these applications have yet to be decided by the Adjudicating Authority, the next date of hearing before such Authority being 08.02.2021.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n6. Shri Jayanth Muth Raj, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellants, has painstakingly taken us through various provisions of the IBC and has argued that the object of Section 14 being that the assets of the corporate debtor be preserved during the corporate insolvency resolution process, it would be most incongruous to hold that a Section 138 proceeding, which, although a criminal proceeding, is in essence to recover the amount of the bounced cheque, be kept out of the word \"proceedings\" contained in Section 14(1)(a) of the IBC. According to the learned Senior Advocate, given the object of Section 14, there is no reason to curtail the meaning of the expression \"proceedings\", which would therefore include all proceedings against the corporate debtor, civil or criminal, which would result in \"execution\" of any judgment for payment of compensation. He emphasised the fact that Section 14(1)(a) was extremely wide and ought not to be cut down by judicial interpretation given the expression \"any\" occurring twice in Section 14(1)(a), thus emphasising that so long as there is a judgment by any court of law (which even extends to an order by an authority) which results in coercive steps being taken against the assets of the corporate debtor, all such proceedings are necessarily subsumed within the meaning of Section 14(1)(a). He also referred to the width of Section 14(1)(b) and the language of Section 14(1)(b) and therefore argued that given the object of Section 14, no rule of construction, be it ejusdem generis or noscitur a sociis can be used to cut down the plain meaning of the words used in Section 14(1)(a). He cited a number of judgments in support of this proposition. He also argued that in any event, even if criminal proceedings properly so-called are to be excluded from Section 14(1)(a), a Section 138 proceeding being quasi-criminal in nature, whose dominant object is compensation being payable to the person in whose favour a cheque is made, which has bounced, the punitive aspect of Section 138 being only to act as an in terrorem proceeding to achieve this result, it is clear that in any event, a hybrid proceeding partaking of this nature would certainly be covered. He cited a number of judgments in order to buttress this proposition as well.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nShri Jayant Mehta, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the respondent, rebutted each of these submissions with erudition and grace. He referred to the Report of the Insolvency Law Committee of February 2020 to drive home his point that the object of Section 14 being a limited one, a criminal proceeding could not possibly be included within it. He further went on to juxtapose the moratorium provisions which would apply in the case of individuals and firms in Sections 85, 96, and 101 of the IBC, emphasising that the language of these provisions being wider would, by way of contrast, include a Section 138 proceeding so far as individuals and firms are concerned, which has been expressly eschewed so far as Section 14's applicability to corporate debtors is concerned.  He relied upon the ejusdem generis/noscitur a sociis rules of construction that had, in fact, been applied to Section 14(1)(a) by the Bombay High Court and the Calcutta High Court to press home his point that since the expression \"proceedings\" takes its colour from the previous expression \"suits\", such proceedings must necessarily be civil in nature. He cited judgments which distinguish between civil and criminal proceedings and went on to argue that Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is a criminal proceeding whose object may be two fold, the primary object being to make what was once a civil wrong punishable by a jail sentence and/or fine. He relied heavily upon judgments which construed like expressions contained in Section 22(1) of the Sick Industrial Companies Act, 1985 [\"SICA\"], and Section 446(2) of the Companies Act, 1956. He also was at pains to point out from several judgments that the Delhi High Court had not applied Section 14 of the IBC to stay proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996; the Bombay High Court had not applied Section 14 of the IBC to stay prosecution under the Employees' Provident Funds Act, 1952; and that the Delhi High Court had not stayed proceedings covered by the Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002, stating that criminal proceedings were not the subject matter of Section 14 of the IBC.  He thus supported the judgment under appeal, stating that the consistent view of the High Courts has been that Section 138, being a criminal law provision, could not possibly be said to be covered by Section 14 of the IBC. He also relied upon the provision contained in Section 33(5) of the IBC to argue that when a liquidation order is passed, no suit or other legal proceeding can be instituted by or against a corporate debtor, similar to what is contained in Section 446 of the Companies Act, 1956, and if those decisions are seen, then the expression \"or other legal proceeding\" obviously cannot include criminal proceedings. On the other hand, in any case, the expression \"or other legal proceeding\" should be contrasted with the word \"proceedings\" in Section 14(1)(a) of the IBC, which cannot possibly include a criminal proceeding, given its object. Lastly, he also relied upon Section 32A of the IBC, which was introduced by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 w.e.f. 28.12.2019, and emphasised the fact that the liability of a corporate debtor for an offence committed prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process shall cease in certain circumstances. This provision would have been wholly unnecessary if Section 14(1)(a) were to cover criminal offences as well, as they would cease for the period of moratorium. Thus, he argued that this Section throws considerable light on the fact that criminal prosecutions are outside the ken of the expression \"proceedings\" contained in Section 14(1)(a) of the IBC. 8. Shri Aman Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the Union of India in W.P. (Crl.) No. 297/2020, has comprehensively taken us through Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act to argue that a plain reading of the said Chapter would reveal that the offence under Section 138 is a purely criminal offence which results in imposition of a jail sentence or fine or both, being punishments exclusively awardable under Section 53 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 only in a criminal proceeding, and hence, does not fall within \"proceedings\" contemplated by Section 14 of the IBC. He further states that since compounding under criminal law can only take place at the instance of the complainant/injured party, a subordinate criminal court has no inherent power to terminate proceedings under Section 138/141 upon \"payment of compensation to the satisfaction of the court\".  He then relied upon the rule of noscitur a sociis to state that since the expression \"proceedings\" contained in Section 14(1)(a) of the IBC is preceded by the expression \"suits\" and followed by the expression \"execution\", it has to be read in a sense analogous to civil proceedings dealing with private rights of action as contrasted with criminal proceedings which deal with public wrongs. According to the learned Additional Solicitor General, the intent manifest in Section 14 of the IBC is reinforced by the introduction of Section 32A to the IBC in that if the intent of Section 14 were to prohibit initiation or continuation of criminal proceedings, the legislature would not have contemplated the introduction of Section 32A by way of amendment. He further states that if the expression \"proceedings\" contained in Section 14 were to be construed so as to include criminal proceedings, it would render the first proviso to Section 32, which deals with institution of prosecution against a corporate debtor during the corporate insolvency resolution process, and the second proviso, which indicates pendency of criminal prosecution against those in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the corporate debtor, otiose. He relied on the judgment in Aneeta Hada v. Godfather Travels & Tours (P) Ltd., (2012) 5 SCC 661 [\"Aneeta Hada\"] to buttress his submission that criminal liability can fall on Directors/persons in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the corporate debtor even where the corporate debtor may not be proceeded against by virtue of Section 14 or Section 32A. He lastly submits that Sections 81 and 101 of the IBC, in speaking of a moratorium in context of \"any debt\" also lend support to his contention that moratorium under the IBC only applies to civil proceedings within the realm of private law, and that since Section 138 proceedings are not proceedings for the recovery of a debt, they cannot fall within the moratorium provisions set out by Sections 14 or 81 or 101.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nPursuant thereto, on 24.05.2018, the Adjudicating Authority stayed further proceedings in the two criminal complaints pending before the ACMM. In an appeal filed to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal [\"NCLAT\"], the NCLAT set aside this order, holding that Section 138, being a criminal law provision, cannot be held to be a \"proceeding\" within the meaning of Section 14 of the IBC.\n",
    "Case_Result": "9. Having heard learned counsel, it is important at this stage to set out Section 14 of the IBC, which reads as follows:A cursory look at Section 14(1) makes it clear that subject to the exceptions contained in sub-sections (2) and (3), on the insolvency commencement date, the Adjudicating Authority shall mandatorily, by order, declare a moratorium to prohibit what follows in clauses (a) to (d). Importantly, under sub-section (4), this order of moratorium does not continue indefinitely, but has effect only from the date of the order declaring moratorium till the completion of the corporate insolvency resolution process which is time bound, either culminating in the order of the Adjudicating Authority approving a resolution plan or in liquidation.1. The two exceptions to Section 14(1) are contained in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 14. Under sub-section (2), the supply of essential goods or services to the corporate debtor during this period cannot be terminated or suspended or even interrupted, as otherwise the corporate debtor would be brought to its knees and would not able to function as a going concern during this period. The exception created in sub-section (3) (a) is important as it refers to \"transactions\" as may be notified by the Central Government in consultation with experts in finance. . Thus, the Central Government, in consultation with experts, may state that the moratorium provision will not apply to such transactions as may be notified. This is of some importance as Section 14(1)(a) does not indicate as to what the proceedings contained therein apply to. Sub-section 3(a) provides the answer - that such \"proceedings\" relate to \"transactions\" entered into by the corporate debtor pre imposition of the moratorium.3. This definition being an inclusive one is extremely wide in nature and would include a transaction evidencing a debt or liability. This is made clear by Section 96(3) and Section 101(3) which contain the same language as Section 14(3)(a), these Sections speaking of 'debts' of the individual or firm. Equally important is Section 14(3)(b), by which a surety in a contract of guarantee of a debt owed by a corporate debtor cannot avail of the benefit of a moratorium as a result of which a creditor can enforce a guarantee, though not being able to enforce the principal debt during the period of moratorium - see State Bank of India v. V. Ramakrishnan, (2018) 17 SCC 394 (at paragraph 20) [\"V. Ramakrishnan\"].4. We now come to the language of Section 14(1)(a). It will be noticed that the expression \"or\" occurs twice in the first part of Section 14(1)(a) - first, between the expressions \"institution of suits\" and \"continuation of pending suits\" and second, between the expressions \"continuation of pending suits\" and \"proceedings against the corporate debtor...\". The sweep of the provision is very wide indeed as it includes institution, continuation, judgment and execution of suits and proceedings. It is important to note that an award of an arbitration panel or an order of an authority is also included. This being the case, it would be incongruous to hold that the expression \"the institution of suits or continuation of pending suits\" must be read disjunctively as otherwise, the institution of arbitral proceedings and proceedings before authorities cannot be subsumed within the expression institution of \"suits\" which are proceedings in civil courts instituted by a plaint (see Section 26 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908). Therefore, it is clear that the expression \"institution of suits or continuation of pending suits\" is to be read as one category, and the disjunctive \"or\" before the word \"proceedings\" would make it clear that proceedings against the corporate debtor would be a separate category. What throws light on the width of the expression \"proceedings\" is the expression \"any judgment, decree or order\" and \"any court of law, tribunal, arbitration panel or other authority\". Since criminal proceedings under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 [\"CrPC\"] are conducted before the courts mentioned in Section 6, CrPC, it is clear that a Section 138 proceeding being conducted before a Magistrate would certainly be a proceeding in a court of law in respect of a transaction which relates to a debt owed by the corporate debtor. Let us now see as to whether the expression \"proceedings\" can be cut down to mean civil proceedings stricto sensu by the use of rules of interpretation such as ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis.The Court was concerned with the meaning of the expression \"posting\" which occurs in Article 233 of the Constitution, qua District Judges in a State. Applying the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, this Court held that given the fact that the expression \"posting\" comes in between \"appointment\" and \"promotion\" of District Judges, it is clear that a narrower meaning has to be assigned to it, namely, that of assigning someone to a post which would not include \"transfer\". Quite apart from the positioning of the word \"posting\" in between \"appointment\" and \"promotion\", from which it took its colour, even otherwise, Articles 234 and 235 of the Constitution would make it clear that since \"transfer\" of District Judges is with the High Court and not with the State Government, quite obviously, the expression \"posting\" could not be used in its wider sense - see pages 460 and 461. This judgment is an early application of the rule of noscitur a sociis, given the position of a wider word between two narrow words, and more importantly, the reading of other allied provisions in the Constitution.A reading of these judgments would show that ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis, being rules as to the construction of statutes, cannot be exalted to nullify the plain meaning of words used in a statute if they are designedly used in a wide sense. Importantly, where a residuary phrase is used as a catch-all expression to take within its scope what may reasonably be comprehended by a provision, regard being had to its object and setting, noscitur a sociis cannot be used to colour an otherwise wide expression so as to whittle it down and stultify the object of a statutory provision.3. This then brings us to the object sought to be achieved by Section 14 of the IBC. The Report of the Insolvency Law Committee of February, 2020 throws some light on Section 14. Paragraphs 8.2 and 8.11 thereof read as follows:It can be seen that paragraph 8.11 refers to the very judgment under appeal before us, and cannot therefore be said to throw any light on the correct position in law which has only to be finally settled by this Court. However, paragraph 8.2 is important in that the object of a moratorium provision such as Section 14 is to see that there is no depletion of a corporate debtor's assets during the insolvency resolution process so that it can be kept running as a going concern during this time, thus maximising value for all stakeholders. he idea is that it facilitates the continued operation of the business of the corporate debtor to allow it breathing space to organise its affairs so that a new management may ultimately take over and bring the corporate debtor out of financial sickness, thus benefitting all stakeholders, which would include workmen of the corporate debtor. Also, the judgment of this Court in Swiss Ribbons (P) Ltd. v. Union of India, (2019) 4 SCC 17 states the raison detre for Section 14 in paragraph 28 as follows:4. It can thus be seen that regard being had to the object sought to be achieved by the IBC in imposing this moratorium, a quasi-criminal proceeding which would result in the assets of the corporate debtor being depleted as a result of having to pay compensation which can amount to twice the amount of the cheque that has bounced would directly impact the corporate insolvency resolution process in the same manner as the institution, continuation, or execution of a decree in such suit in a civil court for the amount of debt or other liabilityJudged from the point of view of this objective, it is impossible to discern any difference between the impact of a suit and a Section 138 proceeding, insofar as the corporate debtor is concerned, on its getting the necessary breathing space to get back on its feet during the corporate insolvency resolution process. Given this fact, it is difficult to accept that noscitur a sociis or ejusdem generis should be used to cut down the width of the expression \"proceedings\" so as to make such proceedings analogous to civil suits.25. Viewed from another point of view, clause (b) of Section 14(1) also makes it clear that during the moratorium period, any transfer, encumbrance, alienation, or disposal by the corporate debtor of any of its assets or any legal right or beneficial interest therein being also interdicted, yet a liability in the form of compensation payable under Section 138 would somehow escape the dragnet of Section 14(1). While Section 14(1)(a) refers to monetary liabilities of the corporate debtor, Section 14(1)(b) refers to the corporate debtor's assets, and together, these two clauses form a scheme which shields the corporate debtor from pecuniary attacks against it in the moratorium period so that the corporate debtor gets breathing space to continue as a going concern in order to ultimately rehabilitate itself. Any crack in this shield is bound to have adverse consequences, given the object of Section 14, and cannot, by any process of interpretation, be allowed to occur.SECTION 14 IN RELATION TO OTHER MORATORIUM SECTIONS IN THE IBC\n\n26. Even otherwise, when some of the other provisions as to moratorium are seen in the context of individuals and firms, the provisions of Section 14 become even clearer. Thus, in Part III of the IBC, which deals with insolvency resolution and bankruptcy for individuals and partnership firms, Section 81, which occurs in Chapter II thereof, entitled \"Fresh Start Process\", an interim moratorium is imposed thus:27. When the language of Section 14 and Section 85 are contrasted, it becomes clear that though the language of Section 85 is only in respect of debts, the moratorium contained in Section 14 is not subject specific. The only light thrown on the subject is by the exception provision contained in Section 14(3)(a) which is that \"transactions\" are the subject matter of Section 14(1). \"Transaction\" is, as we have seen, a much wider expression than \"debt\", and subsumes it. Also, the expression \"proceedings\" used by the legislature in Section 14(1)(a) is not trammelled by the word \"legal\" as a prefix that is contained in the moratorium provisions qua individuals and firms. Likewise, the provisions of Section 96 and Section 101 are moratorium provisions in Chapter III of Part III dealing with the insolvency resolution process of individuals and firms, the same expression, namely, \"debts\" is used as is used in Section 85.A legal action or proceeding in respect of any debt would, on its plain language, include a Section 138 proceeding. This is for the reason that a Section 138 proceeding would be a legal proceeding \"in respect of\" a debt. \"In respect of\" is a phrase which is wide and includes anything done directly or indirectly - see Macquarie Bank Ltd. v. Shilpi Cable Technologies Ltd., (2018) 2 SCC 674 (at page 709) and Giriraj Garg v. Coal India Ltd., (2019) 5 SCC 192 (at pages 202-203). This, coupled with the fact that the Section is not limited to 'recovery' of any debt, would indicate that any legal proceeding even indirectly relatable to recovery of any debt would be covered.28. When the language of these Sections is juxtaposed against the language of Section 14, it is clear that the width of Section 14 is even greater, given that Section 14 declares a moratorium prohibiting what is mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) thereof in respect of transactions entered into by the corporate debtor, inclusive of transactions relating to debts, as is contained in Sections 81, 85, 96, and 101.Also, Section 14(1)(d) is conspicuous by its absence in any of these Sections. Thus, where individuals or firms are concerned, the recovery of any property by an owner or lessor, where such property is occupied by or in possession of the individual or firm can be recovered during the moratorium period, unlike the property of a corporate debtor. For all these reasons, therefore, given the object and context of Section 14, the expression \"proceedings\" cannot be cut down by any rule of construction and must be given a fair meaning consonant with the object and context. It is conceded before us that criminal proceedings which are not directly related to transactions evidencing debt or liability of the corporate debtor would be outside the scope of this expression.These observations, when viewed in context, are correct. However, this case is distinguishable in that the difference between these provisions and Section 14 was not examined qua moratorium provisions as a whole in relation to corporate debtors vis-a-vis individuals/firms.30. Shri Mehta, however, strongly relied upon Section 32A(1) of the IBC, which was introduced by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020, to argue that the first proviso to Section 32A(1) would make it clear that \"prosecutions\" that had been instituted during the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor will result in a discharge of the corporate debtor from the prosecution, subject to the other requirements of sub-section (1) having been fulfilled. According to him, therefore, a prosecution of the corporate debtor under Section 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act can be instituted during the corporate insolvency resolution process, making it clear that such prosecutions are, therefore, outside the ken of the moratorium provisions contained in Section 14 of the IBC.33. Section 32A cannot possibly be said to throw any light on the true interpretation of Section 14(1)(a) as the reason for introducing Section 32A had nothing whatsoever to do with any moratorium provision. At the heart of the Section is the extinguishment of criminal liability of the corporate debtor, from the date the resolution plan has been approved by the Adjudicating Authority, so that the new management may make a clean break with the past and start on a clean slate. A moratorium provision, on the other hand, does not extinguish any liability, civil or criminal, but only casts a shadow on proceedings already initiated and on proceedings to be initiated, which shadow is lifted when the moratorium period comes to an end. Also, Section 32A(1) operates only after the moratorium comes to an end. At the heart of Section 32A is the IBC's goal of value maximisation and the need to obviate lower recoveries to creditors as a result of the corporate debtor continuing to be exposed to criminal liability. Unfortunately, the Section is inelegantly drafted. The second proviso to Section 32A(1) speaks of persons who are in any manner in charge of, or responsible to the corporate debtor for the conduct of its business or associated with the corporate debtor and who are, directly or indirectly, involved in the commission of \"such offence\", i.e., the offence referred to in sub-section (1), \"as per the report submitted or complaint filed by the investigating authority...\". The report submitted here refers to a police report under Section 173 of the CrPC, and complaints filed by investigating authorities under special Acts, as opposed to private complaints. If the language of the second proviso is taken to interpret the language of Section 32A(1) in that the \"offence committed\" under Section 32A(1) would not include offences based upon complaints under Section 2(d) of the CrPC, the width of the language would be cut down and the object of Section 32A(1) would not be achieved as all prosecutions emanating from private complaints would be excluded. Obviously, Section 32A(1) cannot be read in this fashion and clearly incudes the liability of the corporate debtor for all offences committed prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process. Doubtless, a Section 138 proceeding would be included, and would, after the moratorium period comes to an end with a resolution plan by a new management being approved by the Adjudicating Authority, cease to be an offence qua the corporate debtor.34. A section which has been introduced by an amendment into an Act with its focus on cesser of liability for offences committed by the corporate debtor prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process cannot be so construed so as to limit, by a sidewind as it were, the moratorium provision contained in Section 14, with which it is not at all concerned. If the first proviso to Section 32A(1) is read in the manner suggested by Shri Mehta, it will impact Section 14 by taking out of its ken Section 138/141 proceedings, which is not the object of Section 32A(1) at all. Assuming, therefore, that there is a clash between Section 14 of the IBC and the first proviso of Section 32A(1), this clash is best resolved by applying the doctrine of harmonious construction so that the objects of both the provisions get subserved in the process, without damaging or limiting one provision at the expense of the other. If, therefore, the expression \"prosecution\" in the first proviso of Section 32A(1) refers to criminal proceedings properly so-called either through the medium of a First Information Report or complaint filed by an investigating authority or complaint and not to quasi-criminal proceedings that are instituted under Sections 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the corporate debtor, the object of Section 14(1) of the IBC gets subserved, as does the object of Section 32A, which does away with criminal prosecutions in all cases against the corporate debtor, thus absolving the corporate debtor from the same after a new management comes in.35. This brings us to the nature of proceedings under Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Sections 138 to 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act were added by Chapter XVII by an Amendment Act of 1988. Section 138 reads as follows36. Section 138 contains within it the ingredients of the offence made out. The deeming provision is important in that the legislature is cognizant of the fact that what is otherwise a civil liability is now also deemed to be an offence, since this liability is made punishable by law. It is important to note that the transaction spoken of is a commercial transaction between two parties which involves payment of money for a debt or liability. The explanation to Section 138 makes it clear that such debt or other liability means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.Thus, a debt or other liability barred by the law of limitation would be outside the scope of Section 138. This, coupled with fine that may extend to twice the amount of the cheque that is payable as compensation to the aggrieved party to cover both the amount of the cheque and the interest and costs thereupon, would show that it is really a hybrid provision to enforce payment under a bounced cheque if it is otherwise enforceable in civil law. Further, though the ingredients of the offence are contained in the first part of Section 138 when the cheque is returned by the bank unpaid for the reasons given in the Section, the proviso gives an opportunity to the drawer of the cheque, stating that the drawer must fail to make payment of the amount within 15 days of the receipt of a notice, again making it clear that the real object of the provision is not to penalise the wrongdoer for an offence that is already made out, but to compensate the victim.37. Likewise, under Section 139, a presumption is raised that the holder of a cheque received the cheque for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. To rebut this presumption, facts must be adduced which, on a preponderance of probability (not beyond reasonable doubt as in the case of criminal offences), must then be proved. Section 140 is also important, in that it shall not be a defence in a prosecution for an offence under Section 138 that the drawer had no reason to believe when he issued the cheque that the cheque may be dishonoured on presentment for the reasons stated in that Section, thus making it clear that strict liability will attach, mens rea being no ingredient of the offence. Section 141 then makes Directors and other persons statutorily liable, provided the ingredients of the section are met. Interestingly, for the purposes of this Section, explanation (a) defines \"company\" as meaning any body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals.38. We have already seen how the language of Sections 96 and 101 would include a Section 138/141 proceeding against a firm so that the moratorium stated therein would apply to such proceedings. If Shri Mehta's arguments were to be accepted, under the same Section, namely, Section 141, two different results would ensue - so far as bodies corporate, which include limited liability partnerships, are concerned, the moratorium provision contained in Section 14 of the IBC would not apply, but so far as a partnership firm is concerned, being covered by Sections 96 and 101 of the IBC, a Section 138/141 proceeding would be stopped in its tracks by virtue of the moratorium imposed by these Sections. Thus, under Section 141(1), whereas a Section 138 proceeding against a corporate body would continue after initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process, yet, the same proceeding against a firm, being interdicted by Sections 96 and 101, would not so continue.This startling result is one of the consequences of accepting the argument of Shri Mehta, which again leads to the position that inelegant drafting alone cannot lead to such startling results, the object of Sections 14 and 96 and 101 being the same, namely, to see that during the insolvency resolution process for corporate persons/individuals and firms, the corporate body/firm/individual should be given breathing space to recuperate for a successful resolution of its debts - in the case of a corporate debtor, through a new management coming in; and in the case of individuals and firms, through resolution plans which are accepted by a committee of creditors, by which the debtor is given breathing space in which to pay back his/its debts, which would result in creditors getting more than they would in a bankruptcy proceeding against an individual or a firm.40. A cursory reading of Section 142 will again make it clear that the procedure under the CrPC has been departed from. First and foremost, no court is to take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 138 except on a complaint made in writing by the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque - the victim. Further, the language of Section 142(1) (b) would again show the hybrid nature of these provisions inasmuch as a complaint must be made within one month of the date on which the \"cause of action\" under clause (c) of the proviso to Section 138 arises.The expression \"cause of action\" is a foreigner to criminal jurisprudence, and would apply only in civil cases to recover money. Chapter XIII of the CrPC, consisting of Sections 177 to 189, is a chapter dealing with the jurisdiction of the criminal courts in inquiries and trials. When the jurisdiction of a criminal court is spoken of by these Sections, the expression \"cause of action\" is conspicuous by its absence.41. By an Amendment Act of 2002, various other sections were added to this Chapter. Thus, under Section 143, it is lawful for a Magistrate to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year and a fine exceeding INR 5,000/- summarily. This provision is again an important pointer to the fact that the payment of compensation is at the heart of the provision in that a fine exceeding INR 5000/-, the sky being the limit, can be imposed by way of a summary trial which, after application of Section 357 of the CrPC, results in compensating the victim up to twice the amount of the bounced cheque. Under Section 144, the mode of service of summons is done as in civil cases, eschewing the mode contained in Sections 62 to 64 of the CrPC.Likewise, under Section 145, evidence is to be given by the complainant on affidavit, as it is given in civil proceedings, notwithstanding anything contained in the CrPC. Most importantly, by Section 147, offences under this Act are compoundable without any intervention of the court, as is required by Section 320(2) of the CrPC.By another amendment made in 2018, the hybrid nature of these provisions gets a further tilt towards a civil proceeding, by the power to direct interim compensation under Sections 143A and 148 which are set out hereinbelow:A perusal of this judgment would show that a civil proceeding is not necessarily a proceeding which begins with the filing of a suit and culminates in execution of a decree. It would include a revenue proceeding as well as a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution, if the reliefs therein are to enforce rights of a civil nature. Interestingly, criminal proceedings are stated to be proceedings in which the larger interest of the State is concerned. Given these tests, it is clear that a Section 138 proceeding can be said to be a \"civil sheep\" in a \"criminal wolf's\" clothing, as it is the interest of the victim that is sought to be protected, the larger interest of the State being subsumed in the victim alone moving a court in cheque bouncing cases, as has been seen by us in the analysis made hereinabove of Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act. In Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod v. State of Maharashtra, (2014) 9 SCC 129, a three-Judge Bench of this Court answered the question as to whether the territorial jurisdiction for filing of cheque dishonour complaints is restricted to the court within whose territorial jurisdiction the offence is committed, which is the location where the cheque is dishonoured, i.e., returned unpaid by the bank on which it is drawn. This judgment has been legislatively overruled by Section 142(2) of the Negotiable Instruments Act set out hereinabove. However, Shri Mehta relied upon paragraphs 15.2 and 17 of the judgment of Vikramjit Sen, J., which states as follows:The focus in this case was on the court within whose jurisdiction the offence under Section 138 can be said to have taken place. This case, therefore, has no direct relevance to the point that has been urged before us.53. A conspectus of these judgments would show that the gravamen of a proceeding under Section 138, though couched in language making the act complained of an offence, is really in order to get back through a summary proceeding, the amount contained in the dishonoured cheque together with interest and costs, expeditiously and cheaply. We have already seen how it is the victim alone who can file the complaint which ordinarily culminates in the payment of fine as compensation which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque which would include the amount of the cheque and the interest and costs thereupon. Given our analysis of Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act together with the amendments made thereto and the case law cited hereinabove, it is clear that a quasi-criminal proceeding that is contained in Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act would, given the object and context of Section 14 of the IBC, amount to a \"proceeding\" within the meaning of Section 14(1)(a), the moratorium therefore attaching to such proceeding.54. Shri Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General, took strong objection to the use of the expression \"quasi-criminal\" to describe proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which, according to him, can only be described as criminal proceedings. This is for the reason that these proceedings result in imprisonment or fine or both, which are punishments that can be imposed only in criminal proceedings as stated by Section 53 of the Indian Penal Code. It is difficult to agree with Shri Lekhi. There are many instances of acts which are punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which have been described as quasi-criminal. One instance is the infraction of Section 630 of the Companies Act, 1956. This section reads as follows:Having so held, the Court did not construe the provision strictly, which it would have been bound to do had it been a purely criminal one, but instead gave it a broad, liberal, and purposeful construction as follows:55. Likewise, contempt of court proceedings have been described as \"quasi-criminal\" in a long series of judgments. We may point out that the predecessor to the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, namely, the Contempt of Courts Act, 1952 did not contain any definition of the expression \"contempt of court\". A Committee was appointed by the Government of India, referred to as the Sanyal Committee, which then went into whether this expression needs to be defined. The Sanyal Committee Report, 1963 then broadly divided contempts into two kinds - civil and criminal contempt - as follows:56. The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 expressly states that the said Act was in pursuance of the Sanyal Committee Report as followsThe Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 defines \"civil contempt\" and \"criminal contempt\" as follows:Punishments awarded for contempt of court, whether civil or criminal, are then dealt with by Section 12 of the Act, which states:59. In criminal contempt cases, \"cognizance\" in contempts other than those referred to in Section 14 of the Act is taken by the Supreme Court or the High Court in the manner provided by Section 15. Section 17 then lays down the procedure that is to be followed after cognizance is taken. Finally, by Section 23, the Supreme Court and the High Courts are given the power to make rules, not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act, providing for any matter relating to its procedure.The description of contempt proceedings being \"quasi-criminal\" in nature has its origin in the celebrated Privy Council judgment of Andre Paul Terence Ambard v. Attorney-General of Trinidad and Tobago, AIR 1936 PC 141 in which Lord Atkin referred to contempt of court proceedings as quasi-criminal (see page 143)That contempt proceedings are \"quasi-criminal\" is also stated in Kanwar Singh Saini v. High Court of Delhi, (2012) 4 SCC 307 (at paragraph 38) and in T.C. Gupta v. Bimal Kumar Dutta, (2014) 14 SCC 446 (at paragraph 10).63. What is clear from the aforesaid is that though there may not be any watertight distinction between civil and criminal contempt, yet, an analysis of the aforesaid authorities would make it clear that civil contempt is essentially an action which is moved by the party in whose interest an order was made with a view to enforce its personal right, where contumacious disregard for such order results in punishment of the offender in public interest, whereas a criminal contempt is, in essence, a proceeding which relates to the public interest in seeing that the administration of justice remains unpolluted. What is of importance is to note that even in cases of civil contempt, fine or imprisonment or both may be imposed. The mere fact that punishments that are awardable relate to Section 53 of the Indian Penal Code would not, therefore, render a civil contempt proceeding a criminal proceeding. There is a great deal of wisdom in the finding of the Sanyal Committee Report that the question whether a contempt is civil or criminal is not to be judged with reference to the penalty which may be inflicted but with reference to the cause for which the penalty has been inflicted.64. Clearly, therefore, given the hybrid nature of a civil contempt proceeding, described as \"quasi-criminal\" by several judgments of this Court, there is nothing wrong with the same appellation \"quasi-criminal\" being applied to a Section 138 proceeding for the reasons given by us on an analysis of Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act. We, therefore, reject the learned Additional Solicitor General's strenuous argument that the appellation \"quasi-criminal\" is a misnomer when it comes to Section 138 proceedings and that therefore some of the cases cited in this judgment should be given a fresh look.65. Shri Mehta then argued that Section 33(5) of the IBC may also be seen, as it is a provision analogous to Section 14(1)(a). Section 33(5) states as follows:It will be noted that under this Section, the expression \"no suit or other legal proceeding\" occurs both in the enacting part as well as the proviso. Going by the proviso first, given the object that the liquidator now has to act on behalf of the company after a winding-up order is passed, which includes filing of suits and other legal proceedings on behalf of the company, there is no earthly reason as to why a Section 138/141 proceeding would be outside the ken of the proviso. On the contrary, as the liquidator alone now represents the company, it is obvious that whatever the company could do pre-liquidation is now vested in the liquidator, and in order to realise monies that are due to the company, there is no reason why the liquidator cannot institute a Section 138/141 proceeding against a defaulting debtor of the company. Obviously, this language needs to be construed in the widest possible form as there cannot be any residuary category of \"other legal proceedings\" which can be instituted against some person other than the liquidator or by the liquidator who now alone represents the company. Given the object of this provision also, what has been said earlier with regard to the non-application of the doctrines of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis would apply with all force to this provision as well.Here again, given the fact that it is the resolution professional alone who is now to preserve and protect the assets of the corporate debtor in this interregnum, the resolution professional therefore is to represent and act on behalf of the corporate debtor in all judicial, quasi-judicial, or arbitration proceedings, which would include criminal proceedings. Here again, the word \"judicial\" cannot be construed noscitur a sociis so as to cut down its plain meaning, as otherwise, quasi-judicial or arbitration proceedings, not being criminal proceedings, the word \"judicial\" would then take colour from them. This would stultify the object sought to be achieved by Section 25 and result in an absurdity, namely, that during this interregnum, nobody can represent or act on behalf of the corporate debtor in criminal proceedings. Likewise, if a corporate debtor cannot be taken over by a new management and has to be condemned to liquidation, the powers and duties of the liquidator, while representing the corporate debtor, are enumerated in Section 35. Section 35(1)(k), in particular, states as followThis provision specifically speaks of \"prosecution\" and \"criminal proceedings\". Contrasted with Section 25(2)(b) and Section 33(5), an argument could be made that the absence of the expressions \"prosecution\" and \"criminal proceedings\" in Section 25(2)(b) and Section 33(5) would show that they were designedly eschewed by the legislature. We have seen how inelegant drafting cannot lead to absurd results or results which stultify the object of a provision, given its otherwise wide language. Thus, nothing can be gained by juxtaposing various provisions against each other and arriving at conclusions that are plainly untenable in law.67. Shri Mehta then relied strongly upon judgments under Section 22(1) of the SICA and under Section 446(2) of the Companies Act, 1956. He relied upon BSI Ltd. v. Gift Holdings (P) Ltd., (2000) 2 SCC 737, which judgment held that the expression \"suit\" in Section 22(1) of the SICA would not include a Section 138 proceeding. The Court was directly concerned with only this expression and, therefore, held:This case is wholly distinguishable as the word \"proceedings\" did not come up for consideration at all. Further, given the object of Section 22(1) of the SICA, which was amended in 1994 by inserting the words that were interpreted by this Court, parliament restricted proceedings only to suits for recovery of money etc., thereby expressly not including prosecution proceedings, as was held by this Court. The observations contained in paragraph 20, that Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is a penal provision in a criminal proceeding cannot now be said to be good law given the march of events, in particular, the amendments of 2002 and 2018 to the Negotiable Instruments Act, as pointed out hereinabove, and the later judgments of this Court interpreting Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act.69. Likewise, all the judgments cited under Section 446(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 are distinguishable. Section 446(2) states as follows:70. In S.V. Kandeakar v. V.M. Deshpande, (1972) 1 SCC 438 [\"S.V. Kandeakar\"], this Court explained why income tax proceedings would be outside the purview of Section 446(2) as follows:From this judgment, what becomes clear is the fact that the winding-up court under Section 446(2) is to take up all matters which the company court itself can conveniently dispose of rather than exposing a company which is under winding up to expensive litigation in other courts. This being the object of Section 446(2), the expression \"proceeding\" was given a limited meaning as it is obvious that a company court cannot dispose of an assessment proceeding in income tax or a criminal proceedingThis is further made clear in Sudarshan Chits (I) Ltd. v. O. Sukumaran Pillai, (1984) 4 SCC 657 (at paragraph 8) and in Central Bank of India v. Elmot Engineering Co., (1994) 4 SCC 159 (at paragraph 14).71. Shri Mehta also relied upon D.K. Kapur v. Reserve Bank of India, 2001 SCC OnLine Del 67 : (2001) 58 DRJ 424 (DB). This judgment referred to Section 446(1) and (2) of the Companies Act, 1956 and contrasted the language contained therein with the language contained in Section 457 of the same Act, which made it clear that the liquidator in a winding up by the court shall have power, with the sanction of the court, to institute or defend any suit, prosecution, or other legal proceeding, civil or criminal, in the name and on behalf of the company. 72. Shri Mehta's reliance on Indorama Synthetics (I) Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, 2016 SCC OnLine Bom 2611 : (2016) 4 Mah LJ 249, is also misplaced, for the reason that the finding of the Bombay High Court that Section 138 proceedings were not included in Section 446 of the Companies Act only follows the reasoning of the earlier judgments on the scope of Section 446 of the Companies Act. Significantly, given the object of Section 446 of the Companies Act, it was held that a Section 138 proceeding is not a proceeding which has a direct bearing on the collection or distribution of assets in the winding up of a company. Significantly, this Court did not hold that the moratorium provision would not extend to criminal liability. On the contrary, on the assumption that it would so extend, a distinction was made between personal liability of the Directors of the undertaking and the undertaking itself, stating that as the \"employer\" under the Employees' Provident Fund Scheme would only refer to those individuals managing the relief undertaking and not the relief undertaking itself, the personal liability of such persons would not fall within the scope of the moratorium provision.This judgment also, therefore, does not, in any manner, support Shri Mehta.This raison detre is completely different from what has been advocated by Shri Mehta. The confiscation of the proceeds of crime is by the government acting statutorily and not as a creditor. This judgment, again, does not further his case.77. As far as the Directors/persons in management or control of the corporate debtor are concerned, a Section 138/141 proceeding against them cannot be initiated or continued without the corporate debtor - see Aneeta Hada (supra). This is because Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act speaks of persons in charge of, and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company, as well as the company.Since the corporate debtor would be covered by the moratorium provision contained in Section 14 of the IBC, by which continuation of Section 138/141 proceedings against the corporate debtor and initiation of Section 138/141 proceedings against the said debtor during the corporate insolvency resolution process are interdicted, what is stated in paragraphs 51 and 59 in Aneeta Hada (supra) would then become applicable. The legal impediment contained in Section 14 of the IBC would make it impossible for such proceeding to continue or be instituted against the corporate debtor. Thus, for the period of moratorium, since no Section 138/141 proceeding can continue or be initiated against the corporate debtor because of a statutory bar, such proceedings can be initiated or continued against the persons mentioned in Section 141(1) and (2) of the Negotiable Instruments Act. This being the case, it is clear that the moratorium provision contained in Section 14 of the IBC would apply only to the corporate debtor, the natural persons mentioned in Section 141 continuing to be statutorily liable under Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act.81. Shri S. Nagamuthu, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant, has made various submissions before us. Suffice it to state that his first submission is that as a moratorium is imposed against the corporate debtor w.e.f. 10.07.2017, the Section 138 complaint that was preferred on 19.09.2017 must be quashed.82. On the facts of this case, three cheques - for INR 25,00,000/- dated 31.05.2017, for INR 25,00,000/- dated 30.06.2017, and for INR 23,51,408/- dated 31.07.2017 were issued by the appellant in favour of the respondent. Before the cheques could be presented for payment, on 10.07.2017, the Adjudicating Authority admitted a petition by an operational creditor under Section 9 of the IBC and imposed a moratorium under Section 14. The three cheques were presented for payment, but were returned citing \"insufficient funds\" as the reason on 04.08.2017. The legal notice to initiate proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was issued by the respondent on 12.08.2017. As no payment was forthcoming within the time specified, the respondent preferred a complaint against the corporate debtor alone on 19.09.2017.83. The respondent did not dispute the aforesaid dates, only reiterating that the High Court was right in dismissing a quash petition filed by the appellant under Section 482 of the CrPC.84. Since the complaint that has been filed in the present case is against the corporate debtor alone, without joining any of the persons in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the corporate debtor, the complaint needs to be quashed, given our judgment in Civil Appeal No.10355 of 2018. The judgment under appeal, dated 02.04.2019, is therefore set aside and the appeal is allowed.Criminal Appeals arising out of SLP (Criminal) Nos.10587/2019, 10857/2019, 10550/2019, 10858/2019, 10860/2019, 10861/2019, 10446/2019.85. Leave granted.\n\n86. On the facts of these cases, all the complaints filed by different creditors of the same appellant under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act were admittedly filed long before the Adjudicating Authority admitted a petition under Section 7 of the IBC and imposed moratorium on 19.03.2019.87. Given our judgment in Civil Appeal No.10355 of 2018, the said moratorium order would not cover the appellant in these cases, who is not a corporate debtor, but a Director thereof. Thus, the impugned order issuing a proclamation under Section 82 CrPC cannot be faulted with on this ground. The appeals are therefore dismissed.\n\nCriminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Criminal) Nos.2246-2247 of 2020\n\n88. Leave granted.9. In this case, the two complaints dated 12.03. 2018 and 14.03.2018 under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act were filed by the respondent against the corporate debtor along with persons in charge of and responsible for the conduct of business of the corporate debtor. On 14.02.2020, the Adjudicating Authority admitted a petition under Section 9 of the IBC against the corporate debtor and imposed a moratorium. The impugned interim order dated 20.02.2020 is for the issuance of non-bailable warrants against two of the accused individuals.\n\n90. Given our judgment in Civil Appeal No.10355 of 2018, the moratorium provision not extending to persons other than the corporate debtor, this appeal also stands dismissed.\n\nCriminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Criminal) No.2496 of 202091. Leave granted.\n\n92. In the present case, a complaint under Section 138 read with Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was filed by Respondent No.1 against the corporate debtor together with its Managing Director and Director on 15.05.2018. It is only thereafter that a petition under Section 9 of the IBC, filed by Respondent No.1, was admitted by the Adjudicating Authority and a moratorium was imposed on 30.10.2018. The impugned judgment dated 16.10.2019 held that a petition under Section 482, CrPC to quash the said proceeding would be rejected as Section 14 of the IBC did not apply to Section 138 proceedings.\n\n93. The impugned judgment is set aside in view of our judgment in Civil Appeal No.10355 of 2018, and the complaint is directed to be continued against the Managing Director and Director, respectively.Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Criminal) No.3500 of 2020\n\n94. Leave granted.\n\n95. The complaint in the present case was filed by the respondent on 28.07.2016. An application under Section 7, IBC was admitted by the Adjudicating Authority only on 20.02.2018 and moratorium imposed on the same date. The impugned judgment rejected a petition under Section 482 of the CrPC on the ground that Section 138 proceedings are not covered by Section 14 of the IBC.\n\n96. The impugned judgment is set aside in view of our judgment in Civil Appeal No.10355 of 2018, and the complaint is directed to be continued against the appellant.Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Criminal) No.5638-5651/2020, 5653-5668/2020\n\n97. Leave granted.\n\n98. In these appeals, the appellants have approached us directly from the learned Magistrate's impugned orders. The learned Magistrate has held that Section 14 of the IBC would not cover proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. As a result, warrants of attachment have been issued under Section 431 read with Section 421 CrPC against various accused persons, including the corporate debtor and persons who are since deceased. While setting aside the impugned judgments, given our judgment in Civil Appeal No.10355 of 2018, we remand these cases to the Magistrate to apply the law laid down by us in Civil Appeal No.10355 of 2018, and thereafter decide all other points that may arise in these cases in accordance with lawWrit Petition (Criminal) Nos.330/2020, 339/2020, Writ Petition (Civil) No.982/2020, Writ Petition (Criminal) Nos.297/2020, 342/2020, Writ Petition (Civil) No.1417/2020, 1439/2020, 18/2021, Writ Petition (Criminal) No.9/2021, 26/2021.99. All these writ petitions have been filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India by erstwhile Directors/persons in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the corporate debtor. They are all premised upon the fact that Section 138 proceedings are covered by Section 14 of the IBC and hence, cannot continue against the corporate debtor and consequently, against the petitioners.\n\n100. Given our judgment in Civil Appeal No.10355 of 2018, all these writ petitions have to be dismissed in view of the fact that such proceedings can continue against erstwhile Directors/persons in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the corporate debtor.

Prabhu Vs. Sayed Babalal H, (2010) 5 SCC 663. : (AIR 2010 SC 1907).\nArgument by the Respondent:\nLearned counsel for respondent No.1/complainant who is present in the Court has submitted that the said terms of compromise are genuine, bona fide and he has also prayed that the present criminal revision petition be allowed and the application bearing CRM-31234- 2021 which has been filed for compounding of offence under Section 138 of the Act of 1881 be also allowed after setting aside the judgments of both the Courts below. It is brought to the notice of this Court that the draft of an amount of Rs.50,000/- is still lying with the office of Registrar Judicial of this Court. With respect to the same, liberty had already been granted to the complainant in the order dated 03.09.2021 passed by this Court to get the said demand draft released in his favour. . Learned counsel for respondent No.2/State has also submitted that the State would have no objection in case the present criminal revision petition is disposed of as having been compromised and in fact, in the present case, State has no role to play.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Sonipat vide its judgment of conviction dated 13.12.2017 convicted the petitioner and thereafter the appeal preferred against the same by the petitioner was dismissed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sonepat.\n",
    "Case_Result": "A perusal of the said compromise would show that the complainant party i.e. respondent No.1 had stated that the said compromise has been executed without any force, pressure and coercion from any side.. Learned counsel for the petitioner and respondent No.1/complainant would be bound by the said order and learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner would have no objection in case the said amount is released in favour of the complainant.16. This Court has heard the learned counsel for the parties.17. From the above facts, it is apparent that both the contesting parties are ad idem that the compromise has been effected between the parties without any pressure, threat or undue influence and the terms of the said compromise have been duly complied with. The compromise would go a long way in maintaining the peace and harmony between the parties and thus, a prayer has been made to the Court for compounding the offence in terms of Section 147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 read with Section 320 (6) Cr.P.C. Since the offence relating to dishonour of cheque has a compensatory profile and is required to have precedence over punitive mechanism, therefore, the present revision petition deserves to be allowed.18. It is also relevant to state that the petitioner has already undergone custody of 15 days out of total sentence of one year rigorous imprisonment. Petition allowed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 634ea1de0eb98db8410fb169\n**Facts**:  By this revision petition filed under Section 397, 401 of Cr.P.C., read with Section 482 Cr.P.C. the petitioner seeks to challenge the judgment dated 25.02.2016 passed by learned Additional Session Judge 03 (East), Karkardooma, Delhi, passed in Criminal Appeal No.100/2016, whereby the conviction and sentenced passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate has been upheld. However, the petitioners had preferred the revision petition being Crl. Rev. No. 183/2016 before this court, which was dismissed as withdrawn on 09.03.2016  The factual matrix of the present case is that the complainant- respondent had filed a case against the petitioner on account of dishonour of cheques. According to the complaint, the petitioners had demanded loan of Rs.1 lac for business purpose, which the respondent gave on three different dates, i.e., Rs.17,000/- on 01.02.2007; Rs. 25,000/- on 17.02.2007; and Rs.20,000/- on 19.02.2007 and lastly Rs.38,000/- on 25.03.2007. An agreement was executed between the parties on 25.03.2007. . It is further alleged in the complaint that on 25.06.2007, the respondent demanded the amount back from the petitioners and the petitioners had issued two cheques for Rs.50,000/- each, which were dishonoured by the bank with the remark 'insufficient funds'. Legal notice was sent on 19.12.2007, which was replied by counsel for the petitioners. Thereafter, complaint under Section 138 of NI Act was filed by the respondent. Trial commenced. Complainant deposed himself in support of his case, as CW1 and the accused vide their statement recorded under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. wish to lead defence evidence.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  The learned Metropolitan Magistrate has held the petitioners guilty for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as NI Act) and the petitioner No.1 has been sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for the period of three months and fine of Rs.1.5 lacs was also imposed upon petitioner No.1, however petitioner No.2 was sentenced to pay fine of Rs.50,000/-. Trial concluded and vide order dated 12.05.2015, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate held the petitioners guilty for the offence and vide order dated 19.05.2015, the petitioner No.1 was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months with fine of Rs.1.5 lacs for two cheques and petitioner No.2 was ordered to pay fine of Rs.50,000/- for 1 cheque. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order of conviction and sentence, the petitioners preferred an appeal, which was dismissed by the learned Additional Session Judge vide order dated 25.02.2016 and while upholding the conviction and sentence passed by learned Metropolitan Magistrate, the petitioner No.1 was sent to judicial custody for serving the sentence, as awarded by the Trial Court.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Mr. Vivek Bhadauria, learned counsel for the petitioner contends that due to intervention of the common friends and well wishers, wishers, the disputes/differences between the parties have been amicably settled and to restore the harmony between the parties, they have decided to bury their all disputes and differences.  Lastly, counsel for the petitioner contended that since the matter has been amicably settled between the parties and the petitioners have already deposited a sum of Rs.5,000/- each to the State (totaling Rs.10,000/-) as fine, therefore it is contended that in the facts and circumstances of the present case the impugned order dated 25.02.2016 passed by learned Additional Session Judge be set aside and to give rest to the litigation between the parties, the present revision petition may be allowed and the order on sentence passed by learned Metropolitan Magistrate qua simple imprisonment for a period of 3 months, as imposed upon the petitioner no.1, be set aside.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Even the respondent is not willing to pursue the dispute further and he has given the statement before the court of learned Metropolitan Magistrate that he has amicably settled the matter with the petitioners and has also received the settled amount.  Mr. Ghanshyam Sharma, respondent is present in person and affirms the aforesaid contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner. He has further submitted that he has amicably settled the dispute with the petitioners and nothing remains due on him. He has also submitted that he has no objection if the impugned order on sentence is set aside and the petitioner No.1 is released from jail.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  I have heard the aforesaid submissions of learned counsel for the petitioner as well as respondent who was present in person. I have also perused the material on record.  After considering the submission of the petitioner this court observes that the petitioner No.1 has been held guilty for the offence punishable under Section 138 of NI Act. It is also observed that the parties to the case have resolved their inter-se disputes and the respondent has also given his no objection to setting aside of the impugned order on sentence, and has no objection if the petitioner No.1 is released on bail.  The petitioners have also invoked the inherent powers of this court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and this court is conscious of the fact that the inherent powers of the High Court ought to be exercised to prevent the abuse of process of law and to secure the ends of justice. Mr. Ghanshyam Sharma, respondent has agreed to setting aside the order of sentence qua sentencing the petitioner No.1 for simple imprisonment for a period of three months and has also stated that the dispute between the parties has been settled out of his own free will. Considering the fact that the matter has been settled and compromised amicably, and the fact that the petitioner No.1 is in custody consequent upon the impugned order dated 25.02.2016 passed by learned Additional Session Judge, this Court is of the considered opinion that this is a fit case to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to secure the ends of justice.  The incorporation of inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is meant to deal with the situation in the absence of expressed provision of law to secure the ends of justice such as, where the process is abused or misused; where the ends of justice cannot be secured; where the process of law is used for unjust or unlawful object; to avoid the causing of harassment to any person by using the provision of Cr.P.C. or to avoid the delay of the legal process in the delivery of justice. Whereas, the inherent power is not to be exercised to circumvent the express provisions of law.  It is settled law that the inherent power of the High Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. should be used sparingly. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of State of Maharashtra through CBI v. Vikram Anatrai Doshi and Ors. 2014 ILO SC 637 and in the case of Inder Singh Goswami v. State of Uttaranchal has observed that powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. must be exercised sparingly, carefully and with great caution. Only when the Court comes to the conclusion that there would be manifest injustice or there would be abuse of the process of the Court if such power is not exercised, Court would quash the proceedings.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case revolves around the conviction of the petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, arising from unpaid cheques issued by the petitioner to the respondent. The lower court upheld the conviction, which has been challenged by the petitioner through a criminal revision petition.\n\nUpon reviewing the case, it appears that the lower court's judgment is correct in principle. The evidence presented, including the non-payment of cheques and the legal notice issued by the respondent, supports the conviction. However, the agreement reached between the parties through the compromise deed, along with the petitioner's readiness to deposit 15% of the cheque amount in accordance with the Supreme Court's judgment in Damodar S. Prabhu vs. Sayed Babalal H, (2010) 5 SCC 663, suggests a genuine attempt to settle the dispute.\n\nConsidering the compromise and the petitioner's willingness to adhere to the Supreme Court's guidelines, the criminal revision petition should be allowed. The judgment of the lower court should be set aside, and the case should be disposed of as compromised. The applicability of Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) in this context allows for the preponement of the hearing date and final disposal of the case.\n\nIn conclusion, the appeal is allowed, the judgment of the lower court is set aside, and the case is disposed of as compromised."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. Heard Mrs. R.P. Jog, the learned counsel for the applicant and Mr. R.P. Goenka, counsel for respondent 1 and Mr. M.K. Pathan, the learned APP for respondent 2. 2. The applicant, who is arraigned as accused 5 in Summary Criminal Case 5363/2017, which is instituted by respondent 1 under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (\"Act\" for short) approached the learned Sessions Judge under section 397 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (\"Code\" for short) in Criminal Revision 99 of 2018, challenging the order dated 4.12.2018, rendered by the th Judicial Magistrate First Class, (13 Court), Akola, of issuance of process.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe submission of the learned counsel Mrs. R.P. Jog rests on the premise that it is incontrovertible that the accused was not in charge of the affairs of the firm or responsible to the firm for the day to day conduct of the business, and therefore, the vicarious principle underlying the provisions of section 141 of the Act, do not come into play.  The edifice of the submission that the accused was not in charge of the affairs of the firm is constructed on a document dated 9.1.2013 which purports to be a partnership deed incorporating a recital that the accused shall only be a working partner. Mrs. R.P. Jog invites my attention to a complaint in which the complainant placed on record copy of the partnership deed. I noted the name of the complainant which is Mr. Dilip Goenka and asked Mrs. R.P. Jog to explain as to how Mr. Dilip Goenka filing the partnership deed in a complaint lodged by him personally, can be construed as an admission of the complainant herein that such a partnership deed does exists and correctly reflects the factual scenario.  I was amazed by the response which is that Mr. Dilip Goenka who filed on record the partnership deed in his personal capacity as the complainant, also appears as counsel for the complainant in the present matter. In the interest of observing restraint, I say nothing more. Indeed the response is noted only as a courtesy to the learned counsel. 11. In the midst of dictation, only in order to satisfy my conscience, I again asked Mrs. R.P. Jog whether there is any incontrovertible material suggesting that the complainant has admitted the contents of the partnership deed dated 9.1.2013 and in response Mrs. R.P. Jog submits that she has already pointed out the material and that I should consider her next submission that averments in the complaint, which are not substantiated by material, are not sufficient to clothe the learned Magistrate with the jurisdiction to issue process.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nBefore I advert to the factual matrix, it would be apposite to note the submission of the learned counsel Mr. R.P. Goenka, who appears on behalf of the respondent 1, who shall be referred to as the complainant, hereinafter. Mr. R.P. Goenka submits that the complaint specifically asserts that the accused was in charge of the affairs of the firm and indeed the averments in the complaint travel a step ahead, in the sense, that the averment further is that the accused is equally responsible for the offence committed by the firm since the offence is committed with his consent and /or connivance. Mr. R.P. Goenka would emphasize the statutory scheme to submit, that even a person, who is not in charge of the affairs of the firm can be roped in as an accused, if the offence is committed by the firm with his consent or connivance.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n3. The learned Additional Sessions Judge, dismissed the revision and the applicant, who shall be referred as the accused hereinafter, is invoking inherent power under section 482 of the Code and the extraordinary jurisdiction under section 227 of the Constitution of India.\n",
    "Case_Result": "5. While issuing notice vide order dated 5.4.2019, I noted the submission of the learned counsel Mr. A.C. Dharmadhikari that the partnership deed referred to supra excludes the applicability of the doctrine of vicarious liability. I issued notice for the limited purpose of ascertaining whether the partnership deed can be considered, in the factual matrix, as an incontrovertible material.The law is too well settled to burden this judgment with reference to the plethora of the decisions which hold the field. . An incontrovertible material is, ordinarily, a public document in public domain or a private document which is not disputed or is irrefutable. It is not even argued, that the partnership deed is a public document. Be it noted, that according to the accused, the partnership firm is not registered.The partnership deed which is pressed in service to canvas the submission that the accused was not in charge of the affairs of the firm is not a document in public domain. I, therefore, called upon Mrs. R.P. Jog to bring to my notice any material in the nature of an admission by the complainant of the partnership deed on which the accused is relying.12. Mrs. R.P. Jog invites my attention to the decision of the Apex Court in SMS Pharmaceuticals (supra).15. Several decisions of the Apex Court have followed SMS Pharmaceuticals to hold that an averment that the partner was in charge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the firm is a basic requirement which persuades the learned Magistrate to issue process. An illustrative reference may be made to Gunmala Sales Private Limited and others..vs..Navkar Infra Projects Private Limited and others, (2015)1 SCC 103 : (AIR 2015 SC 1072) (\"Gunmala Sales\").17. The articulation of law is therefore, that when a petition is filed for quashing the process, in a given case, on an overall reading of the complaint, the High Court may find that the basic averment that the director or partner is in charge of the affairs of the company / firm is sufficient to issue process. Indeed, Gunmala Sales articulates that the further role of the director or the partner can be brought out in the trialHowever, Gunmala Sales further articulates, that notwithstanding that the basic averment is made, the High Court is not bound to dismiss the petition. Notwithstanding that the complaint incorporates the basic averment, the High Court may come across some unimpeachable evidence or acceptable circumstances which may in its opinion lead to the conclusion that the director or partner could not have been in charge of the affairs of the company or the firm. . A learned Single Judge of this court does take a view that the role of the accused must be specifically spelt out in the complaint and that the averments must be supported with linkage of corresponding documents which bring to the fore the personal involvement of the accused.20. Central Bank of India takes the case of the accused no further. The enunciation is that for launching a prosecution against the directors of a company, there has to be a specific allegation in the complaint in regard to the part played by them in the transaction in question and that the allegations must be in clear and unambiguous words showing that the directors were in charge of and responsible for the business of the company. I have reproduced the averments. Nothing further was necessary, nothing further is required. The part played by the accused in the transaction/s is spelt out with particularity.21. Mrs. R.P. Jog then relies on the observations in paragraph 15 in Central Bank of India which record that except the statement that the accused were directors and were responsible and liable for the acts of the company, no specific allegation is made against them. The Apex Court then observes that the question of proving a fact not mentioned in the complaint did not, therefore, arise in the facts of this case. It is then observed that admittedly except for the statement, no other material has been disclosed in the complaint (emphasis supplied) to make out a case against the respondents that they had been in charge of the affairs of the company. Considering the averments in the complaint, it cannot be said that there is no material averred, in contradistinction with evidentiary material which is a matter of trial, in the complaint, as would satisfy the test of the pleadings.The decision in N.K. Wahi vs. Shekhar Singh and Ors, and in particular, the observations in paragraph reproduced supra, is clearly misunderstood by the learned counsel Mrs. R.P. Jog. The Apex Court notes in paragraph 4 that the High Court found that preliminary evidence had been recorded. It is in this context that in paragraph 8, the Apex Court declares that in the absence of any averment or specific evidence, the net result would be that complaint would not be entertainable. It is obvious from the use of the expression \"or\" that it would suffice if the basic averment is incorporated and the question of sufficiency of evidence would have to be cogitated if there is evidence on record or then after the parties adduce evidence, at the stage of final hearing.24. The last decision on which Mrs. R.P. Jog relies is the decision of the Apex Court in Rajeev Thapar and Ors vs. Madan Lal Kapoor, [(2013)3 SCC 330 : (2013 Cri LJ 1272 (SC))], arising out of SLP (Cri.) 4883/2008 which is referred to and reproduced in the decision in Prashant Bharti vs. State of NCT of Delhi [SLP (Cri.) 1800 of 2009], the observations in paragraph 23, read thus: Petition dismissed",

Two of issues that have arisen for consideration in this case are : firstly, whether Section 148 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred as 'the Act', for short) which had come in force w.e.f. 01.09.2018 by the Amendment Act 20 of 2018 is retrospective or prospective and secondly, whether an appellate court in an appeal preferred against a judgment and order of conviction and sentence for an offence under Section 138 of the Act is to assign any reason while directing the appellant to deposit an amount in terms of the provisions of Section 148 of the Act. . In order to appreciate the issues, a brief narration of the events which had led to passing of the impugned order dated 17.12.2018 appears necessary. A complaint case came to be instituted before the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kamrup (M), Guwahati by the respondent no. 2-complainant (hereinafter referred to as 'the complainant', for short) alleging commission of an offence under Section 138 of the Act. The said complaint was registered and numbered as C.R. Case No. 78C/2015. It was projected therein that both the complainant and the accused who is the petitioner here, are businessmen. In the year 2011, the accused approached the complainant for a personal loan of Rs. 9,00,000/-.  The complainant paid the amount of Rs. 9,00,000/- in two instalments on 15.06.2011 and 25.10.2011. For the purpose of repayment of the said loan the accused issued 4 (four) nos. of account payee cheques drawn on an account maintained by him with State Bank of India, Beltola Branch. The said 4 (four) nos. of cheques were dated 20.09.2014, 27.09.2014, 25.10.2014 & 25.10.2014 respectively. The complainant presented all the 4 (four) cheques for collection on 04.11.2014 but the cheques were returned unpaid with remarks - 'insufficiency of fund' and 'no seal'. The complainant thereafter, sent a legal notice through his advocate to the accused on 29.11.2014. It was asserted that the notice was duly served on the accused on 01.12.2014 and in response to the said notice, the accused had also sent a reply on 17.12.2014 stating, inter-alia, that he had already paid the amount of Rs. 9,00,000/- to the complainant by cash as well as by cheques.  On receipt of the said complaint, the same was registered as C.R. Case no. 78/2015 and forwarded to the Court of Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, II, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati ('the trial Court', for short) for disposal.  When the particulars of the offence were stated to him, he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.  In the course of trial that followed, the complainant examined himself as P.W.-1 and exhibited 7 (seven) nos. of documents in support of his case. Thereafter, the accused was examined under Section 313, CrPC and he desired to adduce evidence. The accused examined as himself as D.W.-1 and exhibited 3 (three) nos. of documents in support of his case.  Being aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the said judgment and order dated 19.11.2018, the petitioner as the appellant, had preferred an appeal under Section 374(3) of the Code before the Court of learned Sessions Judge, Kamrup at Guwahati.  The said appeal was registered and numbered as Criminal Appeal Case no. 191/2018 and the appeal was forwarded to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge (F.T.C.) No. 3, Kamrup (Metro), Guwahati ('the appellate court', for short) for disposal.  When the appeal came up for consideration before the appellate court on 17.12.2018, the appellate court heard the submission of the learned counsel for the accused-appellant. After going through the memo of appeal and hearing the submission of learned counsel, the appeal was admitted and notice was issued to the respondent-complainant. The record of C.R. Case No. 78/2015 was called for from the trial court. 7. Mr. Gogoi, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State has submitted in similar lines as Mr. Deka.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  The learned trial court took cognizance of the offence under Section 138 of the Act and issued process against the accused for his appearance. On receipt of summons, the accused entered his appearance. After conclusion of the trial, the learned trial court found the accused guilty of the offence under Section 138 of the Act. By a judgment and order dated 19.11.2018, the trial court convicted the accused under Section 138 of the Act and he was sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for 2 (two) years and to pay a compensation of Rs. 18,00,000/- to the complainant, in default of payment of the said compensation, to undergo simple imprisonment for another 2 (two) months. On a prayer made on behalf of the accused-appellant, the appellate court suspended the operation of the impugned judgment and order of the learned trial court, subject to deposit 20% of the total compensation awarded by the trial court within the next date fixed on 18.02.2019.  It is that part of the order whereby the appellate court has directed the convicted accused-appellant i.e. the petitioner herein to deposit 20% of the compensation amount of Rs. 18,00,000/- within 18.02.2019, which is assailed in this criminal petition.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Mr. Mitra, learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted primarily on two aspects, firstly, in the provision of Section 148 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 which has been inserted w.e.f. 01.09.2018 by amendment, the use of the word \"may\" has given discretion to the appellate court for direction to deposit less than the minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial court.  Thus, the said provision is not mandatory and secondly, the petitioner as the accused, had adduced evidence before the learned trial court wherein he had exhibited 3 (three) nos. of documents before the trial court in support of his contention that he had paid the amount borrowed from the complainant in the meantime. But the said evidence was not considered and appreciated in the proper perspective by the learned trial court. When that aspect was brought to the notice of the appellate court, the same was not considered by the appellate court while passing the impugned order dated 17.12.2018.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Mr. Deka, learned counsel for the respondent no. 2-complainant has submitted that the issue regarding retrospectivity of the provision of Section 148 of the Act is no longer res integra in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Surinder Singh Deswal Alias Colonel S. S. Deswal and others vs. Virender Gandhi, reported in (2019) 11 SCC 341. He has submitted that the issue regarding discharge of debt or liability by the accused had been considered by the learned trial court and the same was not found acceptable.  Thus, the said issue cannot be agitated before this Court in a criminal petition preferred under Section 482 of the Code challenging an order where the appellate court had directed the appellant to deposit 20% of the compensation amount in terms of the provision contained Section 148 of the Act.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 8. I have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials made available on record.  In so far as the issue as to whether the provision of Section 148 of the Act is prospective or retrospective in nature is concerned, it is found that the said issue is no longer res integra in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Surinder Singh Deswal (supra). The background facts in Surinder Singh Deswal were of similar nature like the case in hand. In Surinder Singh Deswal, (2019) 11 SCC 341 (supra), when the accused preferred an appeal before the appellate court challenging his conviction under Section 138 of the Act the appellate court while suspending the sentence and allowing an application under Section 389 of the Code, directed the appellants to deposit 25% of the compensation awarded by the trial court.  The criminal complaint cases in Surinder Singh Deswal were filed prior to 01.08.2018 and the judgments and orders were passed by the trial court on 30.10.2018.  In another set of litigation preferred by the same appellants in Surinder Singh Deswal alias Colonal S. S. Deswal and others vs. Virender Gandhi and another, reported in (2020) 2 SCC 514 the Supreme Court has reiterated and affirmed its earlier observations made in Surinder Singh Deswal, (2019) 11 SCC 341 (supra). It has further been held that when suspension of sentence passed by the trial court is granted with a condition, non-compliance of the condition has adverse effect on the continuance of the suspension of the sentence.  The court which has suspended the sentence on a condition, after noticing non-compliance of conviction can hold that the suspension of sentence stands vacated due to non-compliance. The decision of the Bombay High Court in Crl. W.P. Nos. 258 to 260 of 2019 (Ajay Vinodchandra Shah vs. State of Maharastra and another) decided on 14.03.2019 on which Mr. Mitra has placed reliance, has been found to be not a good law in so far as the consequences of non-compliance of condition of suspension is concerned, by Surinder Singh Deswal, (2020) 2 SCC 514 (supra). 10. In so far as the submission advanced on behalf of the petitioner as regards discretion available to the appellate court under Section 148 of the Act to make a departure from the condition of deposit of not below 20% of the fine/compensation amount awarded by the learned trial court is concerned, it is observed already in the aforesaid decisions in Surinder Singh Deswal (supra) the use of the word \"may\" in the amended Section 148 of the Act is to be construed as a \"rule\" or \"shall\". Thus, what can be culled out from the said observation is that the direction to deposit minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court is \"rule\". If the appellate court decides to dispense with the condition of deposit of minimum 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial court then it has to assign special reasons for dispensing with such deposit. Thus, a direction to deposit a part of the fine or compensation amount awarded by the trial court is the \"rule\" and a direction to make any relaxation of such a condition is an exception, which can only be passed assigning special reasons by the appellate court. . On a query made by this Court, the learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that no separate application under Section 389 of the Code was filed when the appeal was presented and the appeal was heard for admission on 17.12.2018. What was available before the appellate court on that day was the memorandum of appeal presented by the petitioner. The materials before the appellate court available on that date were the grounds taken in the memorandum of appeal. On perusal of the memorandum of appeal, furnished by Mr. Mitra, it is found that no special reasons or circumstances had been cited therein for the appellate court to consider the matter of dispensing with the condition to deposit a part of fine or compensation amount in terms of Section 148 of the Act.  The grounds taken in the memorandum of appeal are, in general, pertaining to the impugned judgment and order of the learned trial court regarding failure to appreciate the evidence in the right and proper perspective. It is not necessary for the appellate court to find out any special reason on its own to make a departure from making a deposit of less than 20% of the fine or compensation awarded, under Section 148 of the Act. Non-assignment of any reason while directing deposit of 20% of the total compensation amount awarded by the trial court, has not made not the order dated 17.12.2018 of the appellate court infirm in any manner. Thus, the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner does not merit consideration. . In so far as the other limb of submission of the petitioner is concerned, it is a settled position of law that an appeal, in essence, is continuation of the proceeding of the original court. Ordinarily, the appeal jurisdiction involves a re-hearing on law as well as on facts when the same is invoked by an aggrieved person. The appellate jurisdiction is co-extensive with the original court's jurisdiction as for appraisal and appreciation of evidence. It is free to redress the errors, if any, committed by the trial court and to reach its own findings on law and facts.  The grounds taken up by the petitioner as the appellant in Criminal Appeal Case no. 191/2018 would be obviously be considered by the appellate court. The appellant is at liberty to advance his submissions as regards the discharge of the debt or liability by him which he had advanced before the trial court which, according to him, were not properly considered by the trial court. This Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code while considering the legality and correctness of the impugned order dated 17.12.2018, does not function as a court of appeal to appreciate and evaluate the evidence adduced by the parties before the trial court. Therefore, the second limb of submission of the petitioner requires no consideration and does not merit acceptance.\n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. The applicant is the complainant in Summary Criminal Case 4103/2017 instituted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (Act) in which the non-applicant is arraigned as the accused. Considering the issue involved, it would not be necessary to note in detail the averments in the complaint. Suffice it to note, that according to the applicant (hereinafter referred to as the complainant) the non-applicant (hereinafter referred to as the accused) borrowed from him Rs.3,00,000/-, repaid Rs.1,50,000/-, and towards discharge of the liability to repay the balance loan amount of Rs.1,50,000/- issued cheque, which was dishonoure 3. The learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Akola issued process vide order dated 16.10.2017, which read thus: Perused the complaint, verification on affidavit and documents on record. Prima facie ingredients of the offence under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act are made out. Hence, issue process under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act against accused as proprietor of Bhagvati Construction on process fee. The accused assailed the order of issuance of process in Criminal Revision Application 23/2018, inter alia contending that the statutory notice dated 11.08.2017 issued by the complainant was defective and, therefore, did not furnish the cause of action to institute the complain . The accused contended that the notice dated 11.08.2017 which was issued for and on behalf of Rishabh Marketing by Advocate Ram Somani referred to the Proprietor of Rishabh Marketing as Sushilkumar Dodiya. However, by corrigendum dated 31.08.2017 Advocate Ram Somani informed the accused that the name of the Proprietor of Rishabh Marketing is Anup Dodiya and that the reference to Sushilkumar Dodiya in the notice dated 11.08.2017 is a typographical error.  The accused contended in the memo of revision that the notice dated 11.08.2017 was not issued by the payee of the cheque, and was, therefore, illegal and invalid. It is significant that the complaint in question had been filed by Anup Niranjan Dodiya being proprietor of Rishabh Marketing. Although an attempt was made on behalf of the complainant by notice dated 31/08/2017, directed to the petitioner, clarifying the name of proprietor of the firm being Anup Niranjan Dodiya, however, in the complaint itself the cause of action for filing the complaint has been shown on 28/08/2017 [15 days of the receipt of notice dated 11/08/2017].  Therefore, it is crystal clear that the complainant has relied upon demand notice dated 11/08/2017, which is flawed, showing name of the firm of Rishab Marketing as Susuhil Dodiya, who has no concern with the said firm so also, no business transaction with the accused Sahilendra Vyas. As such, when the demand notice is suffered by the defect in respect of name of complainant, the same can not be treated as valid demand notice as required under section 138 (b) of the Negotiable Instrument Act.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe learned counsel for the complainant Mr. Rishabh Khemuka would submit that the Revisional Court committed a grave error in assuming that the notice was not issued by the payee of the cheque. Mr. Khemuka would submit that the payee of the cheque was Rishabh Marketing.  The accused was clearly aware that the statutory notice dated 11.08.2017 was issued on behalf of Rishabh Marketing in relation to the dishonour cheque dated 01.08.2017 drawn on the Akola Janta Co-operative Bank bearing number 300706 for Rs.1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Fifty Thousand only). Mr. Rishabh Khemuka invites my attention to the reply dated 18.08.2017 addressed by the accused to the statutory notice dated 11.08.2017 and submits that the reply is addressed to as many as seven members of the Dodiya family including the complainant Anup Dodiya. Mr. Rishabh Khemuka submits that in the reply dated 18.08.2017 the accused contended that the entire Dodiya family is engaged in illegal money lending and that Niranjan Dodiya, Anup Dodiya - complainant and Ashish Dodiya obtained certain signed blank papers and cheques from the accused, one of which is misused. Mr. Khemuka emphasizes that in the said reply there is no assertion whatsoever that the statutory notice dated 11.08.2017 is not issued by the payee.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n The learned counsel for the accused Mr. A.R. Deshpande would reiterate the submission which found favour with the Revisional Court. Mr. Deshpande would rely on the decision of the Supreme Court in Milind Shripad Chandurkar v. Kalim M. Khan and Anr 2011 Cri. L.J. 1912, and the decision of the Supreme Court in Shankar Finance and Investments v. State of Andhra Pradesh and others (2008) 8 SCC 536 : (AIR 2009 SC 422). The contention of the accused, which found favour with the Revisional Court, is that since the initial notice dated 11.08.2017, which was issued on behalf of the payee, incorrectly referred to Mr. Sushilkumar as the proprietor, the notice is defective. 17. The submission of Mr. Deshpande that the statutory notice was not issued by the payee is difficult to accept. In my considered view, the statutory notice was indeed issued by the proprietary concern which is irrefutably the payee.  The fact that the learned counsel who issued the notice incorrectly named the proprietor, and which error according to the corrigendum is a typographical error, does not detract from the fact that the statutory notice was issued on behalf of Rishabh Marketing which was the payee of the cheque dishonoured.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n6. The learned Additional Sessions Judge, Akola allowed the revision and quashed the order of issuance of process, vide judgment dated 05.04.2019, reasoning thus: Perusal of demand notice dated 11/08/2017 would show that the said notice was issued on behalf of Rishabh Marketing through proprietor Sushilkumar Dodiya.\n",
    "Case_Result": ". In my considered view, the Revisional Court erred in quashing the order of issuance of process on the premise that the notice was not issued by the payee Section 138 provides for the penal consequences for the dishonour of cheque subject to the satisfaction of conditions (a) (b) and (c) Proviso (b) referred to supra mandates that the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque shall make a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing to the drawer of the cheque within the prescribed period.In contradistinction with a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, a proprietary concern is not legal entity distinct from its proprietor and a proprietary concern is only a trade name under which an individual carries on business.It is well settled that if the proprietary concern intends to file a civil suit, the proper description of the plaintiff would be Mr. ABC carrying on business under the name and style of M/s DEF. However, the institution of complaint under Section 138 of the Act is governed by Section 142 which requires that the complainant should be the payee and if the payee is the proprietary concern, it is permissible to lodge the complaint in the name of the proprietary concern itself. While the proprietary concern is competent, as the payee, to lodge the complaint under Section 138 of the Act, the description of the complainant would ideally be M/s DEF represented by its proprietor Mr. ABC or Mr. ABC, sole proprietor of M/s DEF.An error or defect in describing the proprietary concern in the complaint may, in a given situation be of some significance in the sense that if the proprietary concern is represented by a person who is not the proprietor, it would be safe to assume that the complaint is incompetently instituted. In the factual matrix obtaining, it is irrefutable that the statutory notice was issued by the payee. The accused nurtured no doubt in his mind that the statutory notice is issued on behalf of Rishabh Marketing. The accused further was clearly aware that the statutory notice was issued alleging dishonour of the cheque, described with particularity in the notice. The reply of the accused is addressed to the Dodiya family including Mr. Arun Dodiya who is the proprietor of Rishabh Marketing.It is not in dispute that the statutory notice incorrectly refers to Sushilkumar as the proprietor, which error is brought to the notice of the accused vide the corrigendum dated 31.08.2017. However, irrespective of the corrigendum, the accused did not labour under any confusion or misunderstanding and the defence which he took in the reply was of misuse of the cheque by the members of the Dodiya family who according to the accused are involved in illegal money lending.he reliance placed by Mr. Deshpande on the decision of the Supreme Court in Shankar Finance and Investments v. State of Andhra Pradesh and others (2008) 8 SCC 536 is not quite apposite. The question which was considered by the Supreme Court was whether the complaint under Section 138 which is signed by the power of attorney holder on behalf of the sole proprietor of the payee concern, is maintainable. The Supreme Court held the complaint signed by the power of attorney holder is maintainable. Petition allowed",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. By Writ Petition (St.) No.4770 of 2020, under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner/original complainant has impugned Order dated 28th September 2020 passed below Exh.-10 in Criminal Appeal No. 58 of 2020, by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Raigad-Alibag, rejecting the said Application filed by him for modification of Order of suspension of sentence passed below Exh.-4, dated 27th February 2020 by the Appellate Court. By the said Order dated 27th February 2020 passed below Exh.-4, the Appellate Court while suspending sentence imposed upon the respondent No.2/original accused and granting him bail, has directed him to deposit 25% of total compensation awarded by the Trial Court within a period of 60 days from the date of the passing of the said Order and if the respondent fails to deposit the said amount within stipulated period, it will carry interest at the rate of 6% per annum. 2. Parties herein will be hereinafter referred to as per their original nomenclature before the Trial Court. The petitioner 'Habib' will be termed as 'complainant' and respondent 'Altaf' will be termed as 'accused'. he Writ Petition (St.) No.7963 of 2020 is filed by original accused in S.C.C. No. 589 OF 2010, under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short, \"N.I. Act\"). The accused has impugned th Order dated 28 September 2020 passed below Exh.-20 in Criminal Appeal No. 58 of 2020, allowing the said Application preferred by complainant for release of amount of Rs.47,07,500/- deposited by the accused in furtherance of Order dated 27th February 2020 passed below Exh.-4 by the same Court. The record reveals that, the complainant Habib Fakih had instituted a complaint bearing S.C.C. No. 589 of 2010 under Section 138 of N.I. Act in the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Pen, Dist. Raigad. The record further reveals that, after pronouncement of the said Judgment and Order, the accused filed an Application under Section 389(3) of the Cr.P.C. for suspension of sentence and his release on bail. . The accused thereafter preferred a substantive Appeal bearing Criminal Appeal No. 58 of 2020 and filed an Application therein for suspension of sentence and releasing him on bail. The complainant therefore filed an Application below Exh.-10 for modification of the Order passed below Exh.-4.  The Appellate Court after hearing learned Advocates for the complainant and accused, was pleased to reject the said Application by its Order dated 28th September 2020 predominantly on the ground that, after passing of the said Order below Exh.-4, dated 27th February 2020, it had become functus officio and had no power to modify its own earlier Order.  he said Order is impugned herein in Writ Petition (St.) No.4770 of 2020. The complainant also filed an Application below Exh.-20 for release of the said amount of Rs.47,07,500/- deposited by the accused in furtherance of Order passed below Exh.-4. The Appellate Court by its separate Order dated 28th September 2020 passed below Exh.-20 allowed the said Application and directed the complainant to execute indemnity bond of Rs.5,000/- with usual conditions incorporated therein. The accused has impugned the said Order dated 28th September 2020 passed below Exh.-20 in Writ Petition (St.) No.7963 of 2020. The aforestated are the basic admitted facts on record in both the Petitions herein.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n8. Mr. Desai, learned counsel for the complainant submitted that, it took about 10 years for the complainant to get the said complaint bearing S.C.C. No. 589 of 2010 decided from the Trial Court. He submitted that, the accused is successful in protracting the said proceedings for more than nine and half years.  That, in Special Leave to Appeal No.7589 of 2018 preferred by the accused, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had directed the Trial Court to decide the said complaint within a period of 3 months, as it was pending for 9 years and it was only thereafter the Trial Court disposed off the said complaint. He submitted that, the accused has been directed to pay a total sum of Rs.1,88,30,000/- to the complainant by the Trial Court and as per the directions of the Appellate Court, the accused to deposit only 25% of the said amount during the pendency of the said Appeal is insufficient. Mr. Desai by relying on the observations made by the Apex Court, in the case of Makwana Mangaldas Tulsidas Vs. State of Gujarat and Anr. in S.L.P. (Criminal) No.5464 of 2016 dated 05th March 2020 (downloaded from internet site 'Indiankanoon'), submitted that, a matter which is supposed to be disposed off summarily by the Trial Court in six months, took about ten years for disposal at the Trial Court level.  That, it will take substantial time even to decide the Appeal and for that reason the complainant should not be further made to suffer. He submitted that, proviso to Section 148(1) of N.I. Act permits an additional compensation to be awarded than the interim compensation paid by the appellant under Section 143A of the Act and therefore the Court has every power to direct the accused to pay more interim compensation over and above twenty percent to the complainant. He submitted that, the accused was responsible for delay in conducting the trial. That either of the parties herein had to approach the High Court or the Hon'ble Supreme Court on eight occasions, i.e.on five occasions before the High Court and on three occasions before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and therefore it is the accused who is responsible for the delay. He tendered across the bar a compilation of various Orders passed by the High Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court. He submitted that, therefore the amount of interim compensation may be enhanced and the accused may be directed to deposit entire compensation amount in the Registry of the Appellate Court during the pendency of the Appeal. He also submitted that, though the complainant has not impugned Order dated 28th September 2020 passed below Exh.20, the direction for executing indemnity bond of Rs.5,000/- is improper and the said direction may be suitably modified.  It is a fact on record that, the complainant had instituted complaint on 30th December 2010 and the same came to be decided on 11th February 2020 i.e. almost after nine and half years. As noted earlier, the Trial Court has directed the accused to pay a compensation of Rs.1,88,30,000/-. The Appellate Court while passing Order below Exh.-4 has added a rider in Clause No. 3 of his operative part that, if the accused fails to deposit the said amount within a period of 60 days, it will carry interest at the rate of 6% per annum. Mr. Desai, learned counsel for the complainant submitted that, this rider gives license to the accused for non-payment of the compensation under the pretext that, he will pay 6% interest on the said amount during the pendency of the Appeal. I find substance in the said submission. However, as a matter of fact and as per the submission made by the learned counsel for the accused, the accused has already deposited 25% of the compensation amount in the Registry of the Appellate Court and therefore it is not necessary to deal with said contention.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n9. Per contra, Smt. Godse, learned counsel for the accused vehemently opposed the Petition of the complainant and submitted that, it is not the accused who is solely responsible for the delay in conducting trial. She submitted that, the complainant is also responsible for the same. She submitted that, merely because the complaint was decided after a lapse of about 10 years, itself can not be a ground for directing the accused to deposit more compensation than what has been directed by the Appellate Court.  While impugning Order dated 28th September 2020 passed below Exh.-20, she submitted that, the Appellate Court ought not have released the said amount in favour of the complainant as it was deposited during the pendency of Appeal. She submitted that, the Appellate Court ought to have imposed strict conditions upon the complainant while releasing the said amount in his favour and therefore, the said impugned Order may be set aside and the complainant may not be permitted to withdraw the said amount. She therefore prayed that, the Petition filed by the complainant be dismissed and the Petition filed by the accused may be allowed. Perusal of record indicates that, the accused on earlier five occasions had approached this Court. He had also approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court on three occasions. That, the Hon'ble Supreme Court by its Order dated 13th November 2019 passed in Special Leave to Appeal (Cri.) No. 7589 of 2018, after taking into consideration the fact that, the complaint lodged by the complainant is pending for 9 years, had directed the Trial Court to conclude the proceedings within a period of three months. It is only thereafter, the Trial Court has ultimately decided the present complaint.  As the substantive Appeal preferred by the accused is pending before the Appellate Court for final adjudication, this Court is precluded from commenting on the merits involved in it. The issue before this Court therefore is, whether to increase compensation awarded by the Appellate Court by its Order dated 27th February 2020 passed below Exh.-4. The Appellate Court has rejected Application of the complainant filed below Exh.10 for modification of the said Order by its impugned Order dated 28th September 2020.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe Trial Court by its Judgment and Order dated 11th February 2020 was pleased to convict the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I. Act and sentenced him to suffer rigorous imprisonment of two years. The Trial Court also directed the accused to pay compensation of Rs.1,88,30,000/- to the complainant within one month from the date of passing of the said Order and in default of payment of the said compensation to further suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months. The Trial Court by its Order dated 11th February 2020 passed below Exh.171, while suspending the sentence awarded to the accused, imposed a condition that, the accused to deposit 25% of the total compensation amount i.e. Rs.47,07,500/- within 14 days from the date of passing of the said Order. The learned Additional Sessions Judge, Alibag by its Order dated 27th February 2020 passed below Exh.-4 was pleased to suspend the substantive sentence imposed upon the applicant subject to deposit 25% of compensation amount within a period of 60 days from the date of passing of the said Order. It is further directed that, if the accused fails to deposit the said amount within 60 days, it will carry interest at the rate of 6% per annum.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Heard Mr. Desai, learned counsel for the complainant and Mrs. Godse, learned counsel for the accused. Perused record annexed to the Petitions2. During the course of arguments and after taking into consideration the prolonged period consumed in perusing the complaint by the complainant and the observations made by the Appellate Court in its Order dated 27th February 2020 passed below Exh.-4 and particularly in para No.8 that, it will take considerable time to decide the Appeal on its own merits, this Court suggested two options to the accused viz. (i) to pay entire amount as per directions of the trial Court to the complainant in lump-sum and to put an end to the entire litigation by compounding the offence or (ii) to give a bank guarantee for the said amount of Rs.1,88,30,000/- for a period of 9 to 12 months and this Court will direct the Appellate Court to decide the Appeal finally within the same stipulated period.The accused through his learned counsel expressed his inability to accept the said suggestions by giving lame excuses and for inappreciable grounds which are not commensurate with the facts of present case.The conduct of the accused clearly indicates that, he is intending to procrastinate the litigation. As of today, the accused is a convict and his th sentence has been suspended by the Order dated 27 February 2020 passed below Exh.-4 by the Appellate Court. It is also a fact on record that, the accused as of today is successful in protracting the trial for more than 9 and half years and the complainant is the ultimate sufferer for the same.. Section 143 of the N.I. Act deals with power of Court to try cases summarily and states that, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, all offences under this Chapter shall be tried by Judicial Magistrate of the First Class or by a Metropolitan Magistrate and the provisions of Sections 262 to 265 (both inclusive) of the said Code shall, as far as may be, apply to such trials. By amending Act of 20 of 2018 which came st into effect from 1 September 2018, Section 143A has been inserted in this statute. Section 143A gives power to the Court trying an Offence under Section 138 of the Act to Order the drawer of the cheque to pay interim compensation to the complainant. Sub-section (2) of Section 143A states that, the interim compensation under sub-section (1) shall not exceed twenty percent of the amount of the cheque. A corresponding amendment to Section 148 of the Act has also been brought into effect by the same Amendment Act i.e. 20 of 2018. Section 148 of the N.I.Act deals with power of Appellate Court to Order payment pending appeal against conviction. Sub-Section (1) of Section 148 states that, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in an Appeal by the drawer against conviction under Section 138, the Appellate Court may Order the appellant to deposit such sum which shall be a minimum of twenty percent of the fine or compensation awarded by the Trial Court. Proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 148 clearly states that, the amount payable under this sub-section shall be in addition to any interim compensation paid by the appellant under Section 143A. It is thus clear that, under Section 148(1) of the N.I. Act, the Appellate Court can direct the drawer of the cheque in an Appeal against conviction under Section 138 of the Act to deposit such sum which shall be minimum of twenty percent of the fine or compensation awarded by the Trial Court. Order accordingly",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9856\n**Facts**: ) These three petitions are filed aggrieved of orders dated 6.1.2021 whereby Additional Sessions Judge, Faridabad, suspended the sentence awarded under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short 'the Act') subject to deposit of 20% of the compensation amount within a period of one month. It would be appropriate to note at this stage that the period to deposit was extended from time to time. (4) Aggrieved of conviction, appeals alongwith applications for suspension of sentence were filed. On 6.1.2021 notice was issued in the appeal, the sentence was suspended on furnishing of bail bonds of Rs.1,00,000/- and subject to deposit of 20% of the compensation amount.  The Appellate Court proceeded on the basis that there is no discretion with the Court to waive the pre deposit of 20%. The Appellate Court never dealt with the pleas raised for non-deposit. \n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The petitioners were convicted by Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Faridabad, vide judgment dated 3.3.2020 and sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for one year under Section 138 of the Act and to further pay compensation of Rs. 1,05,00,000/- vide order dated 8.10.2020 (7) Relevant portion of the impugned order is quoted below: ''The provisions of Section 148 of NI Act perused. It transpires that it has been specifically mentioned that the appellate court may order the appellant to deposit such sum which shall be a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial Court. In the case in hand, the trial court has awarded compensation of Rs.1,05,00,000/-. Though the word may and shall have been used in the sentence, but it does not give discretion to the Court to waive the said amount. Therefore, the request of the appellant is declined and the application is dismissed.'' \n**Argument by Petitioner**: The grievance raised by learned counsel for the petitioners is that the Appellate Court while passing the impugned orders has not considered the decision of Supreme Court in Surinder Singh Deswal @ Col. S.S. Deswal and others Versus Virender Gandhi, 2019 AIR (Supreme Court) 2956 : (AIRonline 2019 SC 327).\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Learned counsel for the complainant submits that as per the decision of Supreme Court in Surinder Singh Deswal's case (supra), reasons are to be recorded only if waiver of pre-deposit is to be granted. In the present case, as there was a direction to deposit 20% of compensation, no reasons were required to be recorded 10) The contention of counsel for the complainant that reasons are to be assigned only when the waiver is allowed and no reason is to be given if there is direction of pre-deposit of the compensation amounts seems impressive at the first blush but it is not so.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: 9) As per Supreme Court decision while dealing with the exceptional circumstances, the Court has to justify the direction for waiver by assigning reasons.  . The matter needs to be looked from another angle. If a prayer for waiver of pre-deposit has been made before the Appellate Court, the minimum requirement for compliance of principle of natural justice would be that the litigant comes to know from the order passed that the plea raised by him were considered and dealt with. 12. From the perusal of impugned order, it is evident that the Supreme Court decision was not considered. It is not forth coming from the order that the pleas raised by the petitioner for waiver of pre-deposit were dealt with, it is so, as the Court proceeded on the basis that there is no discretion for waiver\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue of the case is whether the lower court correctly decided the appeal filed by the accused in a criminal case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The accused was convicted for issuing a dishonoured cheque and directed to pay a compensation of Rs.1,88,30,000/- to the complainant. The lower court suspended the sentence imposed on the accused and directed him to deposit 25% of the compensation amount within 60 days from the date of passing of the order, failing which it will carry interest at the rate of 6% per annum. The complainant filed an application for modification of the order, which was rejected by the lower court.\n\nThe complainant argues that the accused is responsible for delaying the trial for more than nine and half years and the lower court should have increased the compensation amount. The accused contends that both parties are responsible for the delay and the lower court was right in not increasing the compensation amount.\n\nApplying the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, the lower court correctly decided the appeal. The Act allows for interest on the compensation amount if it remains unpaid, but there is no provision for increasing the compensation amount due to delay in the trial. The complainant's argument of increasing the compensation amount is not supported by the law.\n\nHence, the appeal should be dismissed. The one-word summary is \"DISMISSED\"."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. The appellant/complainant filed a private complaint against the respondents/ accused for offence under Sections 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, before the trial Court (the Metropolitan Magistrate, Fast Track Court at Magisterial Level-IV, George Town, Chennai) in C.C.No.3361 of 2017. Aggrieved against the Judgment of the trial Court, the respondents preferred an appeal before the lower appellate Court (the XVIII Additional Sessions Court, Chennai) in C.A.No.371 of 2019. Against which, the present appeal filed by the appellant/complainant. 2.For the sake of convenience and brevity, the appellant and the respondents are reffered as complainant and accused No.1 and 2 as shown in the complaint. .The brief facts of the case is that A1 is the company viz., M/s.Aegan Industries Private Limited, Tirupur incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956 and A2 is its Managing Director. The complainant was engaged in the business of power manufacturing and supplying. The accused and the complainant entered into a Power Purchase Agreement on 01.04.2013 in Chennai for supply of 2400 KWHR of power and each unit cost was Rs.5.59 for financial year 2016-17. A1 was making payment till February 2016, for purchase and utilization of power. Thereafter, the accused defaulted and delayed payments from February 2016 onwards. For consumption of 31,76,840 KW of power to the value of Rs.1,78,59,870/- became due. The accused agreed to pay the above said amount and in discharge to the liability, issued three cheques drawn by A1, signed by A2 as Managing Director for Rs.42,26,040/- each. During trial, the three cheques were marked as Exs.P2, P3 and P4. When the three cheques were presented for collection on 14.07.2017 with the complainant bank viz., Indian Overseas Bank, Royapuram Branch, Chennai, the same were returned with an endorsement \"Account Closed\" on 15.07.2017. Thereafter, a statutory notice dated 02.08.2017 was issued to the accused. A1 received the same and A2 failed to receive the same and the cover was returned. Ex.P6 is the legal notice dated 02.08.2017; Ex.P7 is the postal tracking receipt; Ex.P8 is the returned of notice of A2 and Ex.P9 is the reply notice sent by accused dated 17.08.2017. 4.In the reply notice (Ex.P9), the accused had taken a stand that three undated cheques were given for the purpose of security in the year 2016 which have been filled up by the complainant. There is admission of some dispute over the said liability, raised in the statutory notice. Hence, following the statutory conditions, the complainant (PW1) has filed a private complaint before the trial Court. 5.During trial, the complainant examined himself as PW1 and marked 9 documents as Exs.P1 to P9. On the side of the accused, no evidence and no documents marked.  The accused aggrieved by the conviction and sentence had preferred an appeal before the lower appellate Court in C.A.No.371 of 2019.  Against which the present appeal. 6.The learned counsel for the appellant/complainant submitted that the accused did not deny the issuance of the three cheques and the signature found in it, thereby the statutory presumption under Sections 118 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 comes into play. He further submitted that as per Section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, if a negotiable instrument is signed and delivered, it gives authority to the holder to make or complete the negotiable instrument and to make his claim. In this case, handing over of the signed cheques is admitted by the accused. Further, the accused had not examined himself or any other person as witness or bring any material to rebut the statutory presumption  By merely putting up some suggestions to the complainant (PW1) during cross examination would not suffice to dislodge the statutory presumption. 7.The learned counsel for the complainant further submitted that as per Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, unless the contrary is proved, it cannot be held that the statutory presumption has been dislodged. Merely by giving some explanation without supported by any evidence and material, it cannot be said that the statutory presumption has been disproved by the accused.  In the statutory notice (Ex.P6), the complainant specifically mentions the business relationship, agreement to supply power, its quantum and the due of the accused. The accused in his reply (Ex.P9) dated 17.08.2017 not denied the business relationship, the purchase of power and its liability. It had merely stated that the cheques were given as security and some dispute in the said liability. During cross examination of the complainant (PW1), some stray questions have been put with regard to the modus of supply of power and its utilization.  Further, there is no specific denial or any suggestion with regard to the supply of power and the liability. Except for a bald suggestion, no specific question was put to the complainant (PW1). During questioning under Section 313 Cr.P.C., the accused made a general denial and no explanation given. It is to be seen that during cross examination of the complainant (PW1), attention drawn, explanation given, thereafter, accused not further proceeded to substantiate the same. The covering letter dated 07.05.2016 which is the foundational basis of the defence, the accused failed to produce this letter. \nArgument by the Petitioner:\n.The learned counsel for the complainant further submitted that the lower appellate Court had given much emphasis to the reply notice of the accused (Ex.P9), wherein the accused mentioned that on 07.05.2016, three cheques (Exs.P2 to P4) were given for the purpose of security and these cheques presented on 14.07.2017 for collection is against the provision of law.  The learned counsel further submitted that the non production of purchase agreement dated 01.04.2013 and the license for generation of power were given undue importance. It is not the case of the accused that the complainant is not generating any power. In the statutory notice (Ex.P6), the purchase of power by the accused from the complainant, the quantum of supply and the dues are mentioned. In the reply notice (Ex.P9), there is no denial on these aspects, admitted facts need not be proved again.  The learned counsel for the complainant further submitted that it is a known fact that a power generating company to supply power to the intended purchasers by using the transmission lines of TANGEDCO, is a statutory body. The lower appellate Court placed emphasis on the power purchase agreement and on other documents, is unwarranted. The lower appellate Court failed to look into the fact that the above complaint was filed for offence under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Once the accused admitted the issuance of the cheque and signature found in it, it is for the accused to dislodged the statutory presumption by bringing materials and evidence to show that there is no liability. In this case, no such exercise done Further, the lower appellate Court placing heavy reliance on the case of \"Indus Airways Private Limited and others., Versus Magnum Aviation Private Limited and another reported in 2014 3 CTC 721 : (AIROnline 2014 SC 89)\", in acquitting the accused is palpably wrong on the facts law law. In that case, the dispute is with regard to advance payment cheques and there is no existing liability. In this case, the liability of the accused to the complainant (PW1) is not denied, the accused only raised a defence that there was some dispute over the said liability.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe admitted case of the accused is that the liability is in dispute. The liability herein denotes the supply of power its utilization by the accused. In view of the same, the lower appellate Court placing emphasis on the power purchase agreement, license, permission etc., are unwarranted. The lower appellate Court without properly adverting to the materials available, failed to understand the purport of Section 118 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, wherein it is stated that the statutory presumption is very much against the accused who failed to discharge the same by plausible and cogent evidence. The finding of the lower appellate Court both on facts and law is palpably wrong, perverse and cannot be sustained. .The learned counsel for the 2 respondent/A2 submitted that A2 only represented A1 company and the cheques were signed by A2 as Managing Director of A1 company. Now, A1 Company is under liquidation. It is the settled preposition that the Managing Director of a Company cannot absolve his liability stating that now he no more represents the company. He further submitted that the liability in question in this case is for alleged power supplied by the complainant to A1 company. During trial, the power purchase agreement dated 01.04.2013 not produced. Thus, non marking of the vital document goes to the root of the case and for withholding this document, no explanation given by the complainant (PW1). The supply of energy is unsupported with any documentary evidence. Except for the complainant, no other witnesses have been examined to prove the fact that the power was supplied by the complainant and in discharge of said liability, the three cheques to the tune of Rs.1,26,78,120/- were handed over to the complainant (PW1). The learned counsel further submitted that on the date of handing over of the cheques, no legally enforceable debt was in existence, which is admitted by the complainant (PW1) in cross examination. In this case, the license for generating power has not been produced. nd The learned counsel for the 2 respondent/A2 further submitted that as per Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the debt or other liability means a legally enforceable debt. The complainant did not produce any material to show that there was a substantive legally enforceable debt on the date of the issuance of the cheques. The accused can probabilize his defence by way of cross examination of the witnesses and also pointing to the materials available on record. This has been rightly done in this case. The complainant (PW1) in this case was cross examined, who admits that in the reply notice (Ex.P9), there is mention about the covering letter dated 07.05.2016 handed over with the three cheques as security. These three cheques were handed over in the year 2016. These three cheques filled up for the liability as on 14.07.2017 presented by the complainant. Thus, the cheques, when handed over on that day there was no liability. nd  The learned counsel for the 2 respondent/A2 further submitted that A2, the Managing of Director of A1 company ceases to represent A1 company which is now declared as corporate debtor and the official liquidator has been appointed by virtue of the order dated 06.07.2018 by the National Company Law Tribunal, Bangalore Branch, in C.P(IB).No.20/BB/2017. The learned counsel further submitted that the lower appellate Court had rightly on proper analysis of the materials and evidence had acquitted the accused giving clear finding that the complainant (PW1) failed to prove the existence of any debt or liability on the date when the cheques were handed over on 07.05.2016 along with the covering letter. nd\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nAfter ful-fledged trial, the trial Court, by judgment, dated 10.10.2019 convicted the respondents for offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments nd Act, 1881 and sentenced the 2 respondent to undergo two years Simple Imprisonment and the respondents 1 and 2 shall pay the cheque amount as compensation of Rs.1,26,78,120/- within one month, in default of nd payment the 2 respondent to undergo six months Simple Imprisonment.   The lower appellate Court, by judgment, dated 18.03.2020 allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment of the trial Court, dated 10.10.2019 After completion of trial, the trial Court convicted and sentenced the accused as stated above. he learned appellate Court, by judgment, dated 18.03.2020, allowed the appeal setting aside the judgment of the trial Court. The trail Court on appreciation of the evidence and materials, after ful-fledged trial, had rightly convicted and sentenced the accused and directed A1 and A2 to pay the cheque amount as compensation jointly and severally. The lower appellate Court not considered these facts and failed to look into the evidence in right perspective and merely on presumption and assumption, had set aside the conviction and sentence of the trial Court, which is not proper and sustainable.  ggrieved against the Judgment of the trial Court, the accused preferred an appeal before the lower appellate Court in C.A.No.371 of 2019. The lower appellate Court, by judgment, dated 18.03.2020 allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment of the trial Court, dated 10.10.2019. \n",
    "Case_Result": "12.The above citations referred are for the preposition that once the cheque is proved to be issued, it carries statutory presumption of consideration and the onus is on the accused to disprove the presumption. The presumption is in favour of the holder of the cheque under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The fact that the cheque might be post- dated does not absolve the drawer of the cheque of the penal consequences of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. As per Section 20, 87 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, it is clear that once a person, who signs a cheque and makes it over to the payee remains liable unless he adduces evidence to rebut the presumption. If the cheque is otherwise valid, the penal provision of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, would be attracted. .Hence, the trial Court had rightly convicted and sentenced the respondent and the lower appellate without proper analysis and appreciation of evidence and consideration of materials, wrongly set aside the judgment of the trial Court, despite the statutory presumption not dislodged. Further on the facts and materials, it is proved that the accused had committed the offence against the established principles and guidelines of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the decisions above mentioned. nd This Court considering the rival submissions and perused the materials available on record. 20.The complainant (PW1) filed a private complaint against the respondents/accused for offence under Sections 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, before the trial Court in C.C.No.3361 of 2017. After ful-fledged trial, the trial Court, by judgment, dated 10.10.2019 convicted the respondents for offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced the nd 2 respondent to undergo two years Simple Imprisonment and the respondents 1 and 2 shall pay the cheque amount as compensation of Rs.1,26,78,120/- jointly and severally within one month, in default of nd payment the 2 respondent to undergo six months Simple Imprisonment. .In this case, the complainant (PW1) was engaged in the business of power generation and supplying the same. The accused had entered into a Power Purchase Agreement for supply of 2,400 KWHR of power at the rate of Rs.5.59/- per unit. In supply of the same, the accused consumed 31,76,840 KW of power to the value of Rs.1,78,59,870/- and agreed to pay the amount. For this payment, three cheques (Exs.P2 to P4) each for Rs.42,26,040/- were given by A2 and got dishonoured. Admittedly, in this case, A2 has not denied his signature or issuance of the three cheques (Exs.P2 to P4). The only defence is that the signed and undated cheques (Exs.P2 to P4) were issued for security purpose on 07.05.2016 along with the covering letter. Hence, the defence is that the cheques were not issued towards the discharge of liability. On perusal of the statutory notice (Ex.P6), it is seen that from the year 2013, the generated power has been supplied to the accused and agreement was entered on 01.04.2013 and thereafter, for the financial year 2015-16, agreement dated 27.03.2015 was entered and for the financial year 2016-17, the Power Purchase Agreement was entered on 25.03.2016. As per the terms of the agreement, the power to be supplied, and the cost are fixed. For the period from 28.02.2016 to 27.05.2016, totally 31,76,840 KW of power were supplied to the tune of Rs.1,78,59,870/-. The total due as on date of notice was to the tune of Rs.1,35,47,644/-. In discharge of the said liability, the three cheques (Exs.P2 to P4) were issued. These facts are clearly narrated in certain terms in the noticen the reply notice (Ex.P9), A2 herein had taken a stand that all the three cheques (Exs.P2 to P4) were undated and given as security purpose on 07.05.2016. It is admitted that the signed undated cheques were handed over by the complainant (PW1). As per Section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, authority is given to the holder to make or complete the negotiable instrument and to make a claim by the complainant against the accused. In the statutory notice (Ex.P6), the details are given and the accused only disputed the liability and not denied the same. The supply of power generated, its utilization by the accused are not disputed. The dispute is with regard to the liability. Subsequently, in the complaint, the same facts are narrated as well as in the sworn statement, proof affidavit and in the evidence. .In cross examination of the complainant (PW1), the complainant admitted the details about the mode of transmission of power, from which year the accused is consuming the power are not given. Further, the complainant (PW1) attention was drawn to the reply notice (Ex.P9) about handing over of the three cheques (Ex.P2 to P4) along with the covering letter on 07.05.2016. Other than this, there is no other cross examination worthwhile was done with regard to the other evidence and materials produced by the complainant (PW1). This bald and formal denial has been rightly ignored by the trial Court. Further, is the admission of the accused that signed cheques were handed over to the complainant, the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 comes into play. Thus the trial Court placing reliance of Section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, found that the accused neither examined himself nor produced any material to disprove the statutory presumption and also found that the cheques (Ex.P2 to P4) were authorized to discharge the liability towards the complainant (PW1) and convicted the accused.In the facts of the case, it is not so. There have been supply of generated power, the dispute raised is with regard to this liability except for raising the same in the reply notice (Ex.P9), there is no other material produced by the accused.The generated power were supplied by the complainant (PW1) and the same were utilized by the accused and there was dues. In the statutory notice (Ex.P6), the supply details and the liability amount have been clearly mentioned. In the reply notice (Ex.P9), the accused did not deny the supply of power, its utilization, it had only stated that there is dispute with regard to the liability. In the reply notice (Ex.P9), no certain terms clearly denoted the supply of power, its utilization and the due to the complainant (PW1). Further, the accused admitted that he handed over the signed three cheques (Exs.P2 to P4). Hence, as per Section 20 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 authorizes and gives authority to the complainant. Having admitted so and in absence of producing any contra material on record, the lower appellate Court finding that the complainant (PW1) answers in his cross examination would suffice in dislodging the presumption and thereby, the complainant (PW1) not proved the liability is not proper, correct and sustainable. The lower appellate Court failed to understand that the appeal is filed under the provision of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, not a civil suit for recovery. The statutory presumption in this case never dislodged by the accused.It is to be seen that it is the admission of the accused that three cheques handed over and the signature found in it are not disputed. Once such admission is made and further in the absence of any contrary material to disprove the liability, it is not necessary for the complainant (PW1) to produce any document further in view of the statutory notice (Ex.P6) containing details and reply notice (Ex.P9) to it not denying the statutory notice in totality. It is not a civil suit which is filed on the basis of the Power Purchase Agreement or any demand was raised for money based on the said agreement. 27.On the date of drawal of cheques (Ex.P2 to P4), there was liability to be discharged by the accused. The contention of the accused that there was dispute, what is the dispute and its quantum were not brought on record by way of cross examination or producing any materials by the accused absolutely there is no cross examination in this regard.

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue of the case is whether the accused are liable for offences under Sections 138 and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, based on the evidence presented by the complainant. The lower court acquitted the accused, ruling that the complainant failed to prove the existence of any debt or liability on the date when the cheques were handed over.\n\nThe lower court's judgment is critically assessed, applying the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. The law states that when a negotiable instrument is dishonoured by non-acceptance, the person by whose direction it is drawn is presumed to have intended to make the payment, unless he proves that he did not sign the instrument, that he did not make, draw or issue it or that at the time of the signing, drawing or issuing of the instrument, he had not sufficient funds in the account on which the instrument was drawn to meet the payment of the instrument in full.\n\nIn this case, the complainant produced three cheques issued by the accused, which were dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The accused did not dispute the issuance of the cheques or their signing, but argued that the liability was in dispute. The lower court, however, placed heavy reliance on the power purchase agreement, license, permission etc., despite the accused's argument that the dispute was over advance payment cheques and not the cheques in question.\n\nConsidering the evidence, the complainant failed to produce the purchase agreement or any documentary evidence to prove the supply of power. The complainant also admitted in cross examination that no legally enforceable debt was in existence on the date of the issuance of the cheques. The accused, on the other hand, produced a covering letter handed over with the cheques, stating that the cheques were given as security.\n\nBased on the analysis, the appeal should be allowed. The lower court's judgment is not properly analysed or supported by the evidence presented. The complainant failed to prove the existence of any debt or liability on the date when the cheques were handed over."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. The present petitioner as the accused was tried by the Court of the learned XXII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Bangalore, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as \"the Trial Court\"), in Criminal Case No.29533/2015 for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as \"the N.I. Act\") and was convicted for the said offence by its judgment of conviction and order on sentence dated 24-09-2016. Aggrieved by the same, the accused preferred a Criminal Appeal in the Court of the learned LXVI Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge, Bangalore City (CCH-67) (hereinafter for brevity referred to as \"the Sessions Judge's Court\") in Criminal Appeal No.1226/2016. The appeal was contested by the respondent who was the complainant in the Trial Court.  Aggrieved by the said order, the accused has preferred this revision petition. 2. The summary of the case of the complainant in the Trial Court is that, the accused who is the relative of the complainant knowing that the complainant was in need of a site (immovable property), approached her and agreed to secure a site to her. Believing the words of the accused, the complainant paid a sum of `32,50,000/- to the accused in cash. Thereafter, the accused failed to secure a site to the complainant within the agreed time. When the complainant approached the accused and demanded for return of the amount of `32,50,000/- paid to her, the accused, towards discharge of her liability to the complainant, issued in total eight (8) cheques, among which, four cheques were drawn on the Karnataka Bank Limited, Basaveshwar Nagar Branch, Bangalore, and bearing Nos.281444, 281445, 281446 and 281447, each for a sum of `4,00,000/- and all dated 14-10-2015. The remaining four cheques were drawn on ICICI Bank, Malleshwaram Branch, Bangalore, in favour of the complainant and were bearing Nos.320904, 320905, 320906 and 320907, each for a sum of `4,00,000/- and all dated 15-10-2015 (cheque No.320907 which is marked at Exhibit P-7 in the Trial Court shows that the cheque amount is not for a sum of `4,00,000/- but it is for a sum of `4,50,000/-). t is also further the case of the complainant that, as per the instructions and assurance of the accused, when she presented those cheques for realisation through her banker, four cheques drawn on Karnataka Bank Limited were returned unpaid with the banker's endorsement as \"payment stopped by drawer\". The remaining four cheques drawn on ICICI Bank also returned unpaid with the banker's endorsement \"funds insufficient\". This made the complainant to issue a legal notice to the accused on 31-10-2015, demanding the cheques' amount to her. After receipt of the legal notice, the accused sent an untenable reply, but did not pay the cheques' amount which made the complainant to institute a criminal case against the accused in the Trial Court for the alleged offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. 4. To prove her case, the complainant got herself examined as PW-1 and got marked documents from Exs.P-1 to P-27 and closed her side. The accused also examined herself as DW-1 and got marked documents from Exs.D-1 to D-16 in her support. Being aggrieved by the judgments of conviction and order on sentence passed by both the Courts, the accused has preferred this revision petition. 6. In view of the fact that the learned counsel for the petitioner failed to appear before this Court on several dates of hearing in spite of granting several and sufficient opportunities, this Court by its order dated 08-04-2021, appointed learned counsel Sri. Shivraj N. Arali, as Amicus Curiae for the petitioner to defend her case.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n12. Learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner/accused in his arguments submitted that, the reply to the legal notice which is at Exhibit D-11 mentions that, the accused was in no way liable to pay the cheques' amount to the complainant and that the complainant had obtained those cheques under coercion. He further submitted that, in the legal notice at Exhibit P-17, as well in the complaint and also in the evidence of PW-1, the complainant has stated that, the amount mentioned in the cheque bearing No.320907 drawn on ICICI Bank is for a sum of `4,00,000/-, when in fact, the said cheque was drawn for a sum of `4,50,000/-. He further submitted that, the accused has filed a Police complaint and later has filed a private complaint against the present complainant and two other persons in a competent Court, alleging the offences punishable under Sections 323, 342, 347, 384, 392 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as \"the IPC\").  Learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner/accused further submitted that, the allegation that towards the repayment of the alleged liability of `32,50,000/- towards the complainant, the accused issued eight cheques instead of a single cheque, also creates a doubt in the case of the complainant. He further submitted that, the complainant has failed to show that, she had any financial capacity to give such a huge amount to the accused. Stating so, the learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner submitted that, the Trial Court as well as the Sessions Judge's Court failed to appreciate these aspects in their proper perspective, which resulted in them passing the impugned judgment of conviction against the accused, which deserves to be set aside. 18. It is also the argument of the learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner/accused that, there is a discrepancy in the complaint with respect to the amount mentioned in one particular cheque at Exhibit P-7. No doubt, the complainant in her complaint as well in her evidence as PW-1 has stated that, the said cheque bearing No.320907 drawn in her favour on ICICI Bank was for a sum of `4,00,000/-, whereas, the said cheque which is marked at Exhibit P-7 shows that it is drawn for a sum of `4,50,000/-.  Learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner/accused also submitted that, the act of the accused in not issuing a single cheque but said to have issued eight cheques in favour of the complainant also raises a doubt in the case of the complainant.  No doubt, according to the complainant, the accused has issued eight cheques to her in total amounting to a sum of `32,50,000/-. Further, there is no doubt that the complainant has not stated either in her complaint or in her evidence as to, how come the accused has given eight cheques instead of a single cheque. But no question was put to PW-1 in her cross- examination in that regard from the accused's side. Since there is no bar under the law that towards the repayment of any alleged liability, only a single cheque is required to be issued, merely because eight cheques are said to have been issued by the accused to the complainant, by that itself, the case of the complainant cannot be disbelieved.  In that regard, had any question been put in the cross-examination of PW-1 from the accused's side to the witness, probably, the witness would have given the details as to how come eight cheques were issued to her by the accused. Without doing such an exercise, now the accused who had an opportunity to elicit the details in that regard, cannot say that, the absence of any details for the issuance of eight cheques would create a suspicion in the case of the complainant. 20. Learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner/accused also canvassed a point that, the complainant has not shown that she had any financial source or any capacity to lend such a huge amount. Admittedly, no such contention was taken up by the accused in the Trial Court.  21. Further, the learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner/accused also contended that, the copy of the complaint at Exhibit D-9 and a copy of the private complaint under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. which is at Exhibit D-14 would go to show that the accused had lodged a Police complaint against the complainant as well a private complaint in the Criminal Court against the present complainant and others, which would go to show that the liability alleged against the accused towards the complainant is a created one. \nArgument by the Respondent:\n. Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant in his argument submitted that, the evidence of PW-1 and the documents produced by her at Exhibits P-24 to P-27 would go to show that, she had financial capacity to give such a huge amount to the accused. He submitted that, Exhibits D-1 to D-7 do not show that, the amounts mentioned therein have been in fact given by the accused to the complainant, as such, those documents would not enure to the benefit of the accused. He further submitted that, the defence taken by the accused through her reply notice is not proved. The private complaint at Exhibit D-14 is purely an after- thought of the accused only to avoid her liability in the cheque bouncing case.  He also submitted that, Exhibit D-5 helps the complainant rather than the accused and would further go to show that, the complainant had parted with a huge sum of `32,50,000/- in favour of the accused which amount the accused is liable to return to the complainant. He also submitted that, the accused herself has admitted about the existence of financial transaction between herself and the complainant. In such an event, it was for her to prove that the cheques in question were not towards any liability by her towards the complainant which she has failed to establish. With this, the learned counsel for respondent/ complainant submitted that, considering all these aspects, the Trial Court has rightly convicted the accused, which was further confirmed by the learned Sessions Judge's Court and the same do not warrant any interference by this Court. However, the complainant as PW-1 in her cross-examination has stated that, she availed loan from REPCO Bank by mortgaging the gold ornaments on several occasions. According to her, in the year 2012, she had availed loan by mortgaging gold ornaments in the REPCO Bank, for the first time, for a sum of `6,00,000/- and then two to three months thereafter, in a sum of `3,00,000/-\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe Sessions Judge's Court in its order dated 13-10-2017 dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the Trial Court dated 24-09-2016 in C.C.No.29533/2015.  5. The Trial Court after recording the evidence led before it and hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 24-09-2016 convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced her to pay the fine amount of `5,000/-, in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of three months and ordered to pay compensation of `32,50,000/- to the complainant at the rate of `6% per annum from the date of cheque till realisation of the same, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of two years. Challenging the said judgment of conviction passed by the Trial Court, the accused preferred an appeal in Criminal Appeal No.1226/2016 before the learned Sessions Judge's Court, which after hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 13-10-2017 dismissed the appeal filed by the accused, while confirming the impugned judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the Trial Court.\n",
    "Case_Result": "9. Though this matter was listed for admission, however, as desired by the learned counsels from both side, the arguments on the main matter itself were heard from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court including the Trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records.10. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth referred to as per their rankings before the Trial Court.14. From the evidence led by both side, the materials placed by them and also from the arguments addressed by the learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner/accused and the learned counsel for the respondent herein, the undisputed or admitted facts remain that, both the complainant and the accused are distant relatives, as such, they are known to each other. DW-1 in her examination-in-chief itself stated that, she knew the complainant.  It is also not in dispute that there existed some financial transactions between the complainant and the accused. In this regard, the accused as DW-1, in her examination-in-chief has stated that, acting as a mediator, she had got a loan of a sum of `10,00,000/- given by the complainant and her brother by name Sri.Suresh to the elder brother of her sister-in-law by name Sri. Ramesh Kumar in the year 2012. However, DW-1 has stated that in the year 2014, the said amount has been repaid by them.15. It is also not in dispute that the cheques at Exhibits P-1 to P-8 pertain to the bank account of the accused and the accused is the drawer of all those cheques. It is further not in dispute that the complainant when presented those cheques for their realisation, all the eight cheques were returned unpaid by the banker for the reason of stoppage of payment with respect to the four cheques drawn on Karnataka Bank Limited and for the reason of insufficiency of funds with respect to the remaining four cheques drawn on the ICICI Bank. It is also not in dispute that, after the dishonor of the cheques, the complainant got issued legal notice to the accused as per Exhibit P-17, after receipt of which, the accused replied to the same as per her reply at Exhibit D-11.All these undisputed and admitted facts would go to show that the complainant as a payee, had presented eight cheques in total amounting to a sum of `32,50,000/-, drawn by the accused in her favour, for their realisation through her banker. However, all those cheques have been returned unpaid for the reasons of insufficiency of funds in respect of four cheques and stoppage of payment by the drawer with respect another four cheques. Thus, prima facie, as per Section 139 of the N.I. Act, a presumption forms in favour of the complainant about the existence of a legally enforceable debt in her favour. However, the said presumption being a rebuttable presumption, the point that is required to be seen is, whether the accused has successfully rebutted the said presumption.16. It is needless to say that, though the complainant is required to prove the alleged guilt against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, but it is sufficient for the accused to make out a case on preponderance of probabilities to rebut the presumption formed in favour of the complainant.17. An attempt was made in the cross-examination of PW-1 to the effect that, in the absence of any agreement regarding the purchase of the site and in the absence of non- mentioning of any details of the alleged site, it is not believable that the complainant had parted with such a huge sum of money in favour of the accused on the alleged assurance of the accused of getting a site to her. However, it cannot be ignored of the fact that, the case of the complainant is not that the accused had identified a particular site and assured of getting that particular site from a particular person for a particular sum. As such, in that regard, no agreement was entered into with the vendor of the site or between the accused and the complainant. In the said statement, it is shown that the complainant has stated before the Police that the accused brought one Sri. Ramesh Kumar with her and promising that the said Ramesh Kumar has got some land in a village called Machohalli and that he would form a layout therein and would give a site to the complainant, made her to part with a sum of `12,00,000/- initially. The complainant is shown to have stated in the said statement that believing their words who included the present complainant also, she gave a sum of `12,00,000/- in the year 2012. It is thereafter on different occasions and on different pretext stating that the daughters of the owner of the land are objecting and that the accused herself is under some financial difficulty and further stating that some more amount is required to be given to the grandson of the owner of the land and some more amount is required to be given to one Sri. Rajendra Babu, the remaining amount was collected in different sums, in total amounting to a sum of `32,50,000/-. However, neither the evidence of PW-1 nor the evidence of DW-1 throw much light as to the alleged details of the site (immovable property) with respect to which the complainant is said to have given huge amount of money to the accused. But it could be made out from the evidence of the complainant (PW-1) and accused (DW-1) that, knowing the fact that the complainant was in search of some site property, the accused who was her relative, approached her. The complainant has nowhere stated that, any particular site was shown to her or that any agreement was made between the parties. Rather it is her case that the accused being her relative, believing her promise, she (complainant) parted with such a huge sum of `32,50,000/- in favour of the accused. In that regard, Exhibit D-15 which was relied upon by the accused stating that, it is a statement given by the complainant before the Kamakshipalya Police, Bengaluru and which statement has been admitted by PW-1 in her cross-examination as the one given by her, throws some light.Therefore, the document (Ex.D-15) produced by the accused itself throws more light about the alleged monetary transaction between the complainant and the accused and shows that the accused by giving one or other reasons and showing one or other causes has obtained amount from the complainant on various occasions. Further, in the very same statement which is marked at Exhibit D-15, the complainant is also shown to have stated that when she had given different amounts on various occasions, she had obtained four cheques drawn on ICICI Bank from the present accused as a security. She is shown to have further stated that, since the accused failed to secure her a site or to repay the amount taken by them, she (complainant) told her that she is going to present those cheques for realisation. However, she was shown to have requested by the accused that she would repay the entire amount in cash, as such, requested the complainant not to present those cheques. In the very same statement at Exhibit D-15, the complainant is also shown to have stated before the Kamakshipalya Police that the complaint given by the accused against her is a false complaint, as a retaliation for the complainant presenting those cheques for their realisation to the Bank and sending them a legal notice, demanding the cheques' amount when those cheques got bounced. The complainant is also shown to have stated in the very same statement at Exhibit D-15 that, she would not take law into her hands but would proceed against them in accordance with law by filing a case for dishonour of the cheques. This alleged statement of the complainant was produced by none else than the accused herself as Exhibit D-15, after confronting the same to PW-1 in her cross- examination, wherein PW-1, after going through the statement admitted that, she had given such a statement before the Police.herefore, when the complainant as PW-1 has admitted that, the said statement was given by her before the Police and the said statement copy was produced by none else than the accused, the same is considered both by the Trial Court as well as the Sessions Judge's Court, who have rightly held that, the said statement favours the complainant than the accused. It is because, in the said statement, the complainant has given more details as to, on how many occasions and for what reasons, she had to part with such a huge sum of `32,50,000/- and how four cheques drawn on ICICI Bank which are the subject matter of the present case came into her hands. Therefore, the defence of the accused of a general denial of the alleged transaction falls to the ground on its own.But, the said minor discrepancy would not take away the case of the complainant for the reason that, the complainant, throughout, starting from her complaint up to her evidence as PW-1, has stated that the total amount payable by the accused to her was `32,50,000/-. The total amount of all the eight cheques, i.e. Exhibits P-1 to P-8 comes to a sum of `32,50,000/-, as such, the minor discrepancy of the cheque amount stated in the complaint and in the evidence of PW-1 with respect to one particular cheque among eight cheques cannot be considered as the material variation affecting the case of the complainant. Further, in the same year, in the month of October-November, one more sum of `4,50,000/- was obtained. It is in that regard, the said REPCO Bank had issued her the identity card which she has produced at Exhibits P-24 to P-27. She has also produced shareholder's pass book of Sree Anjaneya Co-operative Bank Limited at Exhibit P-24, wherein it is shown that she had availed loan of `20,00,000/- from the said Bank in the year 2014. The said evidence of PW-1 coupled with the documents at Exhibits P-24 and P-27 would go to show that, she had the source of funds to give it to the accused.The said argument of the learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner is also not acceptable for the reason that, even according to the learned Amicus Curiae, it is subsequent to the Police complaint at Exhibit D-9, the Police recorded the statement of the present complainant, who was the accused in the said Police complaint as per Ex.D-15 and thereafter issued an endorsement to the present accused who was the complainant in the Police complaint as per Exhibit D-10, stating that the alleged complainant is with respect to financial transaction and the parties were directed to resolve the same by a competent Court of law. However, the present complainant (accused therein) - Smt. Lalitha was warned not to take law into her hands and do any criminal act against the complainant therein (present accused). It is the said statement of the accused in the Police complaint (complainant herein) the accused is relying by producing it at Exhibit D-15 and as observed above, the said statement favours the present complainant more than the accused.. Similarly, merely because a private complaint is said to have been filed by the present accused against the present complainant in a competent Criminal Court under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C., that too, alleging the offences punishable under Sections 323, 342, 347, 384, 392 and 506 of the IPC, it would not by itself weaken the case of the complainant or imbibe any suspicion in the case of the complainant.. It was also not submitted to the Court, when this Court specifically asked the learned Amicus Curiae for the petitioner as to the stage or the status of the said private complaint. Further, the accused as DW-1, in her cross- examination, has admitted that the Police have set aside her complaint stating that her complaint is civil in nature, on the other hand, she has admitted that the cheques at Exhibit P-1 to P-8 are drawn by her and they bear her signature.Therefore, neither Exhibit D-9 nor Exhibit D-14, would in any manner, help the accused in rebutting the presumption formed in favour of the complainant.24. The accused as DW-1 in her examination-in-chief, after stating that, acting as a mediator, she got a loan of a sum of `10,00,000/- given to her sister-in-law's brother by name Ramesh Kumar by the complainant and her brother Suresh, has also stated that the said amount has been repaid. In that regard, she has produced four Bank challans at Exhibits D-1 to D-4 and three loan slips shown to have been issued by Muthoot Finance Limited towards personal loan which are marked at Exhibits D-5, D-6, and D-7 respectively.She has also produced a loan identity card issued by the REPCO Bank and got it marked at Ex.D-8. However, Exhibits D-1, D-5, D-6, D-7 and D-8 nowhere mentions that the amount mentioned therein have been credited to the account of the present complainant, on the other hand, Exhibits D-6 to D-8 only go to show that the accused had availed loan by pledging gold ornaments. By that itself, it cannot be inferred that the alleged loan amount mentioned therein has been paid to the complainant. Exhibits D-2, D-3 and D-4 are counterfoils of Bank challans showing the name of the complainant therein, in total amounting to `24,000/-. Still, those credits are much earlier to the dates of the dis-honoured cheques at Exhibits P-1 to P-8 in the present case. Had really the accused paid at least a small portion of the alleged liability towards the complainant, then she would have issued the cheques after deducting the payment made, if any. As such also, the contention of the petitioner/accused and the documents at Exhibits D1 to D-8 that the accused has repaid the alleged loan for which she claims to be a mediator, is not acceptable.25. Thus, the petitioner/accused though apart from cross- examining PW-1 in detail, has entered herself into the witness-box and led evidence, both oral and documentary, still, could not able to rebut the presumption that was formed in favour of the complainant. The defence taken by her in her reply to the notice which is at Ex.D-11 that the cheques in question were wrongfully obtained by the complainant in a coercive manner and by wrongfully confining the accused in the house of the complainant on 12-07-2005, since has not been proved in any manner, the said defence also cannot weaken the case of the complainant in any manner.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e986b\n**Facts**:  Aggrieved by the same, the accused preferred a Criminal Appeal in the Court of the City Fast Track (Sessions) Judge, Bangalore City (F.T.C.No.VII) (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"Sessions Judge's Court\") in Criminal Appeal No.463/2011. The appeal was contested by the respondent who was the complainant in the Trial Court.  Aggrieved by the said order, the accused has preferred this revision petition. 2. The summary of the case of the complainant in the Trial Court is that, the accused was known to him and in the month of October 2007, he approached him for a hand loan of a sum of `50,000/- for his financial necessity. Acceding to the request of the accused, the complainant lent him a sum of `50,000/- in October 2007 as a loan which was repayable within a period of six months from the said date. Towards the repayment of the said loan amount, the accused issued a cheque bearing No.435018 for a sum of `50,000/- drawn in favour of the complainant, on Canara Bank, Byatarayanapura Branch, Bengaluru-560026. When the said cheque was presented for its realisation, the same came to be dis-honoured with the banker's endorsement 'funds insufficient'.  Thereafter, the complainant got issued a legal notice to the accused demanding the cheque amount. The accused even after receipt of the notice, failed to meet the demand made in the notice, which constrained the complainant to institute a criminal case against the accused in the Trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. 3. The accused appeared through his counsel and contested the matter.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: . The present petitioner as the accused was tried by the Court of the learned XIII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"Trial Court\"), in C.C.No.17396/2008 for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"N.I. Act\") and was convicted for the said offence by its judgment of conviction and order on sentence dated 06-06-2011 The Sessions Judge's Court in its order dated 14-12-2011 dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the Trial Court dated 06-06-2011 in C.C.No.17396/2008.  5. The Trial Court after recording the evidence led before it and hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 06-06-2011 convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of `55,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year.  Challenging the said judgment of conviction passed by the Trial Court, the accused preferred an appeal in Criminal Appeal No.463/2011 before the learned Sessions Judge's Court, which after hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 14-12-2011 dismissed the appeal filed by the accused, while confirming the impugned judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the Trial Court. \n**Argument by Petitioner**: 11. Learned counsel for the petitioner in his arguments submitted that the Trial Court has ignored the defence taken up by the accused. It also ignored the fact that the notice demanding the dis- honoured cheque amount was not served upon the accused. Further, there was no motive for the alleged loan. In such a situation, the Trial Court as well as the learned Session's Judge's Court ought not to have held the accused/petitioner guilty for the alleged offence.\n**Argument by Respondent**: 12. Learned Amicus Curiae for the respondent in his argument submitted that the complainant by leading both oral and documentary evidence has proved that the accused had issued the cheque in question at Ex.P-1 towards repayment of the loan availed by him in October 2007. Admittedly, the said cheque came to be dis-honoured when presented for its realisation. It is also not in dispute that the accused did not meet the demand made in the legal notice. As such, a presumption in favour of the complainant had been formed under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. However, the accused failed to rebut the said presumption. He further submitted that since both the Trial Court and the Sessions Judge's Court, have after proper appreciation of the evidence, convicted the accused, the same does not warrant any interference at the hands of this Court. However, the contention of the accused was that, the legal notice said to have been sent by the complainant after dishonour of the said cheque at Ex.P-1 has not reached him at any point of time.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

To prove his case, the complainant got himself examined as PW-1 and got marked documents from Exs.P-1 to P-6. The accused got himself examined as DW-1 and also got examined one Mrs. Geetha as DW-2 and got marked Bank Pass book as the sole document at Ex.D-1. Being aggrieved by the judgments of conviction and order on sentence, the accused has preferred this revision petition. 6. In view of the fact that the learned counsel for the respondent failed to appear before this Court on several dates of hearing and also considering the fact that this revision petition is nearly ten years' old, this Court by its order dated 25-01-2021, appointed learned counsel Sri. S. Javeed, as Amicus Curiae for the respondent to defend his case. 7. The Trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records were called for and the same are placed before this Court. 8. Heard the arguments from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court including the Trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records 9. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth referred to as per their rankings before the Trial Court. 13. The acquaintance between the complainant and the accused is not in dispute. Even the accused also admitted that the complainant was acquainted with him, but his defence was that the alleged loan amount was only a sum of `10,000/- but not a sum of `50,000/-. Further, it is also not in dispute that the accused is the drawer of the cheque at Ex.P-1 which came to be dis-honoured when presented for its realisation by the complainant with the postal shara 'funds insufficient'. However, the defence of the accused in this regard is that the said cheque was given to the complainant as a security towards a loan of a sum of `10,000/- availed by him in February 2007. 14. The complainant as PW-1 in his Examination-in-chief in the form of affidavit evidence has reiterated the contentions taken up by him in his complaint. He has stated that it is towards the repayment of the loan the accused had issued cheque at Ex.P-1 which came to be dis-honoured when presented for its realisation. He has produced the banker's endorsement at Ex.P-2. Stating that, demanding the cheque amount, he had issued a legal notice to the accused, the witness got marked a copy of the legal notice at Ex.P-3. 15. The accused has not denied that he is the drawer for the instrument at Ex.P-1. He has also not denied or disputed that the said cheque at Ex.P-1 came to be dis-honoured when presented for its realisation by the complainant, as evidenced in the banker's endorsement at Ex.P-2. It is also not denied that the reason for the dishonour of the cheque was insufficiency of funds in his account.  On the other hand, the evidence of PW-1 is that, apart from sending the said legal notice at Ex.P-3 through Registered Post Acknowledgement Due (RPAD) as evidenced in the postal receipt at Ex.P-4, he had also sent a copy of the said notice Under Certificate of Posting (UCP) as evidenced in Ex.P-5. However, admittedly, the said notice sent under Registered Post Acknowledgement Due (RPAD) has been returned to the sender as evidenced in the returned postal cover at Ex.P-6 with the postal endorsement \"not claimed'. 16. A perusal of the returned postal article at Ex.P-6 goes to show that, the postman has attempted to deliver the said postal article for more than two days to the accused and since he noticed that the door of the residence of the accused was locked, he had left an intimation also. An endorsement is there to that effect in the postal article that the intimation was delivered on 15-04-2008.  Thus, when the legal notice was sent by the complainant to the correct address of the accused and the postal authority attempted to deliver the said article to the accused and since the postal authorities also have left an intimation regarding the arrival of the postal article to the accused, it is deemed that the accused is served of the legal notice by the complainant. In addition to the above, the contention of the complainant that, the copy of the very same notice was also sent to the accused Under Certificate of Posting (UCP) as per Ex.P-5 and the said article has been duly served upon the accused, has not been specifically denied or disputed from the accused's side. On the contrary, in the cross-examination of DW-1, the accused himself has voluntarily stated that immediately after receipt of the notice, he came to know the details in it and approached the complainant to pay the balance amount, however, he refused to accept the same. By stating so, DW-1 has made it clear that, he was in receipt of the legal notice sent to him by the complainant.  Therefore, the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that, the said voluntary statement of DW-1 in his cross- examination must be taken as acknowledgment about the receipt of the summons but not the legal notice, as such, there is no proof of service of legal notice upon the accused, is not acceptable. 17. Regarding the possession of the cheque at Ex.P-1 with the complainant is concerned, the only defence of the accused was that, he had availed a hand loan of a sum of `10,000/- from the complainant in February 2007 in the presence of one Smt. Geetha and at that time, as a security for the said loan, he had delivered the cheque at Ex.P-1 duly signed by him, however, the complainant has misused the very same cheque which has led to the present case. 8. Except making the said statement, the accused has not produced any documentary proof to corroborate his contention. However, he got examined one Smt. Geetha in his support, who has stated that, it was in her presence, the complainant had given the accused a hand loan of a sum of `10,000/- in February 2007 and it was at that point of time, the complainant had collected a blank cheque from the accused which has now been misused by him by presenting it in the Court for a sum of `50,000/-.   Denial suggestions were made to the said witness in her cross- examination, however, she has not admitted the same as true. 19. In order to ascertain whether the said evidence of DW-2 inspires any confidence to believe in it, the evidence placed before the Trial Court from both side has to be glanced with respect to the alleged oral evidence of DW-2. In the cross-examination of PW-1, it was attempted to elicit from the witness that he knows DW-2 - Smt. Geetha and it was in her presence the loan of a sum of `10,000/- was given to the accused in February 2007.  However, PW-1 categorically stated that he does not know said Smt. Geetha. Furthermore, the witness has also stated that except the general public, there were none in the vicinity when he delivered the loan in question which is a sum of `50,000/- to the accused in October 2007. Therefore, when PW-1 has stated that DW-2 was a stranger to him and also at the earliest point of time in his evidence as PW-1 made it clear that, there was none present at the time of giving the loan except the general public, it is difficult to believe that DW-2 was present at the time of the alleged transaction said to have taken place in February 2007. 20. In this regard, the non-mentioning of the alleged cheque number said to have been given by the accused to the complainant as a security in February 2007, by DW-2 in her evidence also introduces a suspicion in believing her evidence. Had she really present at the time of the alleged loan transaction in February 2007 and witnessed the alleged delivery of the cheque at Ex.P-1 to the complainant as a security, then, she could also have mentioned the details of the cheque including its serial number, drawee branch details and the cheque amount details etc. But none of these details have been elicited in her evidence. Therefore, merely because DW-2 appears and says that she was a witness to the alleged loan transaction in February 2007, by that itself, it cannot be inferred that no loan transaction had taken place between the complainant and the accused in October 2007.  Therefore, the accused though had taken a defence that the cheque in question was issued as a security to the complainant, could not able to substantiate his contention. Thus, he has failed to rebut the presumption that was formed in favour of the complainant. 1. Both Trial Court as well as the Sessions Judge's Court have rightly appreciated this aspect and thus have come to a conclusion that the complainant had proved the alleged guilt against the accused. In the said finding of the Trial Court, which was further confirmed by the learned Sessions Judge's Court, I do not find any perversity, illegality or irregularity, warranting interference at the hands of this Court. 22. It also cannot be ignored at this stage that admittedly, the accused has not taken any steps to recover the alleged cheque at Ex.P-1, said to have been issued by him to the complainant as a security and no stop payment instruction was admittedly given by him to his banker to stop the payment of the cheque in question.  This inaction on the part of the accused also further strengthens the presumption that has been formed in favour of the complainant. In this background, I do not find any reason to hold that the Trial Court and the Sessions Judge's Court have erred anywhere in holding the accused guilty for the alleged offence.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue in this case is whether the accused is liable for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 for issuing eight cheques in favour of the complainant, out of which four cheques were dishonoured by the bank, and whether the Trial Court and the Sessions Judge's Court rightly convicted the accused for the said offence.\n\nThe lower court's judgment appears to be legally sound, as it has considered the evidence and arguments presented by both parties. The complainant has established her financial capacity to lend such a huge amount, which is sufficient to prove her intent to create legal liability. The dispute regarding the amount mentioned in one particular cheque does not affect the main issue of the complaint, as the accused has not disputed the amount claimed by the complainant. The fact that the accused lodged a Police complaint and private complaint against the complainant does not prove the complainant's allegation is false. The private complaint under Section 200 of the Cr.P.C. is an afterthought of the accused to avoid her liability, and the documents produced by the complainant do not show that the amounts mentioned therein have been in fact given by the accused to the complainant.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the appeal should be DISMISSED, as the lower court's judgment is correct in law and is based on substantial evidence."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. The petitioner was the accused in the Court of learned Prl. I Civil Judge and JMFC at Mysuru (hereinafter referred to as 'the Trial Court) in C.C. No.788/2008 who was tried for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881  The summary of the case of the complainant in the Trial Court is that the accused who was acquainted with her had borrowed a sum of `60,000/- on 01.05.2007, another sum of `35,000/- on 12.07.2007 and one more sum of `55,000/- on 18.09.2007 agreeing to repay the entire amount within a short period of time. However, since the accused did not return the said money, at the demand made by the complainant the accused issued a post-dated cheque bearing No.130273 dated 01.02.2008 for a sum of `75,000/- drawn on State Bank of Mysore, Medical College Extension Counter, Mysore, in favour of the complainant.  When the complainant presented the said cheque for realisation on 01.02.2008 through her banker, the same came to be dishonoured with banker's endorsement \"insufficiency of funds\" on 08.02.2008. It is thereafter the complainant got issued a legal notice to the accused demanding the cheque amount. Since the accused neither replied to the notice nor met the demand, the complainant instituted a case against her for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. In the Trial Court, the accused appeared through her counsel and contested the matter.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner appearing through video conference, in his single point argument submitted that the materials placed by the complainant in the Trial Court itself clearly go to show that there exists no legally enforceable debt as on the alleged date of issuance of the cheque.  Therefore, when there exists no legally enforceable debt, Section 138 of the N.I. Act would not get attracted. This aspect both the Trial Court as well as the Sessions Judge's Court did not consider in its proper perspective which has led them to pass erroneous Judgments.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n6. Learned counsel for the respondent in his arguments submitted that the cheque and its signature as that of the accused is not in dispute. Admittedly, the accused has not replied to the legal notice sent to her by the complainant demanding the cheque amount. No defence evidence has been led to rebut the presumption drawn in favour of the complainant and the complainant was illiterate though she was working in a hospital.  Thus, considering all these aspects, the Trial Court as well as the Sessions Judge's Court have rightly appreciated the evidence and given a correct finding which cannot be called as erroneous or illegal 12. No doubt, learned counsel for the respondent in his arguments submitted that had the accused given a cheque to the complainant about fifteen years back, she should have definitely taken action in recollecting the same.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nAfter recording the evidence led before it and hearing both side, the Trial Court by its impugned Judgment of conviction and Order on sentence dated 10.06.2011, convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced her to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of twenty days and also to pay a fine of `1,00,000/- and in default of payment of fine to undergo simple imprisonment for one month. Challenging the said Judgment of conviction, the accused preferred Crl.A. No.91/2011 in the Court of V Additional District and Sessions Judge, Mysore (for brevity, 'Sessions Judge's Court') which Court, after hearing both side arguments, by its Judgment dated 07.02.2012 dismissed the appeal with regard to conviction. However, it modified the sentence and confined the sentence only for fine amount that too for a sum of `78,000/-. Not satisfied with the same, the accused has preferred the present revision petition.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Heard the arguments of learned counsels for the parties and perused the materials placed on record.7. It is not in dispute that the accused and the complainant were known to each other about fifteen to twenty years prior to the date of cross examination of P.W.1 which was recorded on 28.01.2011. The evidence of P.W.1 that since about fifteen to twenty years the accused was availing loans from her in the form of handloan and used to repay those loans has also not been specifically denied in the cross examination of P.W.1. As such, the acquaintance between the parties and the frequent monetary transactions between them in the form of handloan from complainant to accused remain an undisputed fact. It is also not in dispute that the cheque at Ex.P1 is a cheque pertaining to the account of the accused and it bears the signature of the accused. It is also not in dispute that the said cheque when presented for realisation by the complainant, came to be dishonoured by the banker's endorsement as per Ex.P2 showing that there was no sufficient funds in the account of drawer of the instrument. It is also not in dispute that thereafter the complainant issued a legal notice demanding the cheque amount from the accused as per the notice at Ex.P3 which was served upon the accused as evidenced in the postal acknowledgements at Exs.P4 and P5. However, the only defence of the accused is that there was no debt in existence as on the date of the dishonoured cheque and/or its presentation, as such, Section 138 of the N.I. Act is not attracted. These aspects prima facie confers the presumption in favour of the complainant under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. However, the said presumption is rebuttable.8. In order to rebut the presumption, the accused has taken a defence that there existed no legally enforceable debt as on the alleged date of either issuance of the cheque or presentation of the cheque, as such, Section 138 of the N.I. Act is not attracted. Explanation to Section 138 of the N.I. Act says that, for the purpose of Section 138 of the N.I. Act \"debt or other liability\" means a legally enforceable debt or other liability. Therefore, there must be a legally enforceable debt in order to attract Section 138 of the N.I. Act. No doubt, Section 139 of the N.I. Act forms a presumption in favour of the holder once he proves that he has received a cheque from the drawer of the instrument which cheque is duly executed by the drawer in his favour or that he is the holder in due course of the instrument. The said presumption is rebuttable. No doubt the accused has neither replied to the legal notice served upon her by the complainant nor entered the witness box to lead evidence to rebut the presumption. But it is not mandatory that such a legal notice is required to be necessarily replied or the accused should enter the witness box to rebut the presumption formed in favour of the complainant. If the accused is satisfied that in the cross examination of P.W.1 or through other available materials placed before Court itself, she can rebut the presumption then, she need not have to enter the witness box and lead evidence from her side. Therefore, the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent \"that the accused has neither replied to the notice nor led her defence evidence, as such, her contention cannot be accepted\" is not convincing.9. In order to dismantle the presumption which had formed in favour of the complainant who could show that the accused had issued a cheque as per Ex.P1 which subsequently came to be dishonoured when presented for realisation and also legal notice was issued to the accused, the accused subjected P.W.1 to a thorough and searching cross examination.10. In the cross examination, P.W.1 in the opening paragraph has stated that accused was availing loan from her since about fifteen to twenty years. About fifteen years back the accused had requested her for a loan. At that time she has not given anything in writing except the cheque. It is relying upon the said statement made by the complainant, learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently submitted that even according to the complainant the said cheque was given to her about fifteen years back. Admittedly as on the said date / period, there was no loan in existence, as such, there existed no legally enforceable debt.11. It is pertinent to note that nowhere in her evidence, the complainant has specifically or categorically stated the date of receipt of the cheque by her. She has not stated as to when the accused had given her the cheque which is at Ex.P1. Therefore, when the date of alleged issuance of cheque to the complainant by the accused has not been stated, then the answer to the said question can be looked into only by her answer given in the cross examination where she has stated that the cheque was given to her about fifteen years back. Had really the cheque was given to the complainant subsequent to the alleged loans dated 01.05.2007, 01.07.2007 and 18.09.2007, she should have definitely and necessarily stated the date of issuance of cheque. On the other hand, as already observed above, nowhere in her cross examination she has stated as to when the said cheque was given to her. But in her cross examination she has stated that cheque was given to her about fifteen years back. The said fifteen years back goes back somewhere near the year 1996. Admittedly the loan in question is alleged to have been given by the complainant to the accused in the year 2007. Therefore, a question of issuing a cheque in the year 1996 anticipating taking a loan in the year 2007 would not arise. Though the complainant has not told that cheque given was a post-dated cheque but even according to the complainant there was no existing loan as on the said date of issuance of cheque i.e. fifteen years prior to her date of cross examination which date is 28.01.2011. Furthermore, the complainant has nowhere made any further statement showing any nexus between the said cheque said to have been issued about fifteen years back which is at Ex.P1, and the alleged loans dated 01.05.2007, 12.07.2007 and 18.09.2007. Therefore, the reading of the evidence of P.W.1 in its entirety would clearly go to show that about fifteen years prior to the alleged loan transaction of the year 2007, the accused was in the habit of taking loan from the complainant now and then and she used to repay the same. It is at that time she had given a duly filled cheque to the complainant and complainant has made use of the said cheque as though it has been made towards the repayment of the alleged loans of the year 2007. But the mere alleged inaction to collect the said cheque back would not by itself lead one to believe that the said cheque was given for repayment of the alleged loan of the year 2007. This is also for the reason that P.W.1 (complainant) nowhere has stated that, when her alleged loan said to have been given to the accused in the year 2007 was three different loans totally to `1,15,000/-, how could she receive a cheque for a part amount i.e. `75,000/- only. Nothing is mentioned either in her complaint or in her evidence as to what made her to accept a lesser sum than the alleged sum said to have been lent to the accused. This also further raises a doubt in the contention of the complainant that the cheque in question was given to her towards the alleged repayment of the alleged loans of the year 2007.13. However, both the Trial Court as well as the Sessions Judge's Court ignored these vital aspects but gave more emphasis on the alleged aspects that the complainant was an illiterate and as such, was not aware of the niceties and requirements for the transaction through a cheque. The said reasoning does not appear to be correct in the circumstances of the case for the reason that admittedly, the complainant is working in a hospital and claims to have been doing monetary transaction with none else than the present accused for about fifteen to twenty years. In such a situation, as a money lender though not by profession she was expected to have the basic knowledge about money lending and the cheque transaction etc. When she lends the loan amount and accepts the cheque towards the payment of the loan amount it means that she knows the nature and the consequences of the transaction through cheque.Therefore, her alleged illiteracy would not take away her required knowledge about the transaction through availing cheque.Therefore, when the evidence of none else than the PW-1 (complainant) herself is clear that the cheque was given to her about fifteen years back and admittedly when there was no existing loan liability from the accused towards her and admittedly when the complainant has failed to establish any nexus between the alleged cheque and the subsequent loan of the year 2007, the only conclusion that could have been drawn by the Trial Court as well as the Sessions Judge's Court was that the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption which was formed in favour of the complainant under Section 139 of the N.I. Act.14. Since the Trial Court as well as the Sessions Judge's Court have failed to notice the said aspect and have not appreciated the evidence in its proper perspective, the same has led to the passing of an erroneous Judgment convicting the accused for the alleged offence. Since the said finding now proves to be an erroneous finding with some perversity, the same requires to be set aside and since the complainant has failed to prove that the accused has committed the guilt punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, the petition deserves to be allowed and the accused deserves to be acquitted of the alleged offence. Petition allowed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e98e4\n**Facts**: 2. Perused the trial Court records. The complainant in C.C.No.451/2015 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate First Class III Court at Mysore has preferred this appeal against the judgment and order dated 14.02.2019 passed therein, acquitting the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The case of the complainant is that on 03.01.2008 the accused borrowed a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Fifty Thousand only) from him in order to repay his old loans and also to meet his domestic exigencies. While receiving the entire loan amount, the accused executed a loan bond and agreed to repay the same with interest at the rate of 18% per annum within three years from the date of execution of such loan bond  Thereafter, on 05.08.2010, the complainant approached the accused to repay the said amount. On the same day, the accused issued a cheque bearing No.210769 for a sum of Rs.2,19,750/- (Rupees Two Lakhs Nineteen Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty only), drawn on Vijaya Bank, Nazarbad Branch, Mysuru towards the principal amount and interest. When the said cheque was presented for encashment through his banker, Indian Overseas Bank, Vijayanagara Branch on 13.08.2010, the same was dishonored with an endorsement \"insufficient funds\" in the account of the accused. Thereafter, the complainant issued a legal notice dated 23.08.2010 calling upon the accused to pay the amount mentioned in the cheque. The notice was duly served on 24.08.2010. Since, the accused did not pay the cheque amount even after the lapse of statutory period, a complaint was filed against the accused for taking action for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  In order to establish his case, the complainant got examined himself as PW.1 and got marked Ex.P1 to Ex.P7. The accused denied all the incriminating evidence appeared against him.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The trial Court after considering the evidence and material on record, acquitted the accused. Being aggrieved, the present appeal is preferred.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that the issuance of cheque and the signature on the cheque is not disputed by the accused.  Hence, there is a presumption available in favour of the complainant under Sections 118 r/w Section 119 of Negotiable Instruments Act, It is submitted that the complainant has proved the loan transaction and in the absence of any rebuttal evidence by the accused to disprove the case made out by the appellant, the learned Magistrate was not justified in acquitting the accused. The learned counsel contends that the reasons assigned by the trial Court are not sound and proper and therefore, seeks to set aside the impugned judgment and order of acquittal passed by the trial Court.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Per Contra, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent has contended that the alleged loan transaction is not proved by the complainant. The relevant witnesses before whom the loan is stated to have been advanced to the accused are not examined. The loan bond stated to have been executed at the time of advancing loan amount is also not marked.  He submits that the accused had issued a signed blank cheque in favour of one Rajamma who was running a chit fund business, for the purpose of security and the same has been misused by her in collusion with the complainant. He submits that the complainant has failed to establish that there is legally enforceable debt therefore, the trial Court has rightly acquitted the accused. Hence, seeks to dismiss the appeal.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant and the learned counsel appearing for the respondent. It is the specific case of the complainant that on 03.01.2008 he advanced a hand loan of Rs. 1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Fifty Thousand only) to the accused. The accused received the entire loan amount on the very same day and he executed a loan bond in favour of complainant agreeing to repay the same with interest at the rate of 18% per annum, within three years from the date of execution of such loan bond. However, the complainant has not produced any such loan bond executed by the accused. In the absence of such loan bond stated to have been executed by the accused, it is difficult to accept that the accused borrowed a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Fifty Thousand only) agreeing to repay the same with interest at the rate of 18% per annum.  It is also the case of the complainant that the accused agreed to pay the loan amount within three years. Admittedly, the cheque is not issued on the date of advancing the loan amount. Hence, there is no convincing material to show that any such transaction as stated by the complainant took place on 03.01.2008. The complainant has stated that he approached the accused on 05.08.2010 to repay the said amount and on the same day, the accused issued the cheque in question for a sum of Rs.2,19,750/- (Rupees Two Lakhs Nineteen Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty only). It is not forthcoming as to what was the amount due as on 05.08.2010 towards the hand loan taken by the accused. It is also the case of the complainant that the cash was handed over to the accused in the month of January 2008 at one Siddartha Hotel in the presence of two persons viz., Mr.Sridhar and Somashekar.  The said two persons are not examined by the complainant. The complainant has stated that out of the loan obtained from Co-Operative Bank, he advanced a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- to the accused. The complainant has not produced any documents to show that he had obtained loan from Co-Operative Bank, out of which he lent a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- to the accused. The defence of the accused is that he had issued a signed blank cheque as a security to one Rajamma who was running a chit fund business. The said cheque was misused by the complainant in collusion with the said Rajamma. The complainant in his cross- examination has admitted that there is difference of ink and letters in Ex.P1 to that of signature of the accused. The trial Court has observed that Ex.P1 clearly reflects that the contents of cheques are in different handwriting and that of signature found in Ex.P1.  Therefore, the very statement of PW1 that the accused himself has filled up the contents of the cheque and issued it in his favour cannot be believed.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case is whether the accused is liable for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, for dishonour of a cheque issued on 01.02.2008 for repayment of a debt due by her to the complainant. The Trial Court convicted the accused, and on appeal, the Sessions Judge's Court confirmed the conviction but reduced the sentence.\n\nThe lower court's judgment is based on the presumption arising under Section 139 of the N.I. Act, that the accused had, by issue of the cheque, represented that he had sufficient funds in the bank to his credit or that the bank would honour the cheque, knowing it to be insufficiently covered by funds in the account. The court found that the accused failed to rebut the presumption arising under Section 139 of the N.I. Act by not explaining the genuine reason for the dishonour of the cheque.\n\nUpon examining the case, it appears that the lower court's decision is not clearly erroneous or against the weight of evidence. The accused did not dispute the cheque's genuineness and her signature on it. Furthermore, she did not reply to the legal notice sent by the complainant demanding the cheque amount, nor did she lead any evidence to show that the debt was not legally enforceable on the date of the cheque.\n\nConsidering the arguments and evidence presented, the lower court's decision to convict the accused for an offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act is justified. Therefore, the appeal should be dismissed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n. The petitioner was the accused and the respondent was the complainant before the trial Court in C.C.No.767/2006. For the purpose of convenience, the parties will be referred to henceforth with their ranks before the trial Court. 3. The complainant presented the cheque Ex.P1 dated 01.02.2006 drawn on Vishweshwaraiah Cooperative Society Ltd for a sum of Rs.2,80,000/- for realization. The cheque was purportedly drawn by the accused in favour of the complainant. The said cheque was returned with the Banker's memo as per Ex.P2 with the endorsement \"Insufficient funds\". 4. The complainant issued notice Ex.P3 dated 18.04.2006 to the accused claiming that he had issued the said cheque for discharge of loan of Rs.2,80,000/- borrowed by him on 03.01.2006 without making arrangement for realization of the same. He further claimed in the notice that the accused cheated the complainant and called upon him to pay the cheque amount within 15 days. The notice was served on the accused under the postal acknowledgment card Ex.P4. 5. The accused got issued the reply Ex.D1 dated 27.04.2006 denying the loan transaction and issuance of the cheque in favour of the complainant. In the reply notice - Ex.D1 the accused specifically claimed that he had issued the said cheque to K.Hanumanthappa (DW.2) as a security for the loan borrowed by his father during his life time.  He further claimed that despite he clearing the loan of Hanumanthappa, the cheque was not returned and misusing the said cheque, notice Ex.P3 was issued to him. 11. The accused challenged the said judgment and order before the Principal District and Sessions Judge Shivamogga in Crl.A.No.87/2009. When the matter was pending in appeal the accused filed application under Section 391 read with Section 311 of Cr.P.C., seeking leave to produce documents and to lead additional evidence 12. In view of such order of Appellate court DW.1 was further examined before the trial Court and got marked Exs.D5 to D13. D5 and D.6 were nothing but the copies of Exs.P3 and D2. Ex.D7 and D8 were the postal certificate and cover. Ex.D9 was purportedly issued by DW.2 regarding receipt of some cheques from his borrowers. 13. Ex.D10 was purportedly an agreement executed by the accused in favour of Hanumanthappa to the effect that his father had borrowed Rs.2,51,000/- and out of that he had repaid Rs.79,000/- under the Bank cheque and for the balance loan amount, he had issued five cheques. Out of the five cheque numbers mentioned in the agreement, Cheque No.13940 viz., Ex.P1 was also there. Ex.D11 was the acknowledgment purportedly issued by the Circle Inspector of Police, Kote Circle regarding the complaint filed by Hanumanthappa DW.2 against the complainant and Ex.D12 cheque purportedly issued by the accused in favour of Hanumanthappa on 13.01.2004. Ex.D13 was the statement of account of the accused maintained in Visweswaraiah Cooperative Society Ltd. 14. After receiving additional evidence the trial Court resubmitted the records to the First Appellate Court. The First Appellate Court on hearing the parties by the impugned judgment and order dated 29.10.2014 dismissed the appeal of the accused and confirmed the order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court on the following grounds:  i) On the accused accepting his signature on Ex.P1 and that the said cheque pertains to his account, statutory presumption under Section 118 and 139 of NI Act to the effect that cheque was handed over for consideration towards discharge of legally recoverable debt arises; ii) The rebuttal evidence adduced by the accused was unacceptable; iii) The story of the accused handing over the said cheque to DW.2 as security for the loan borrowed by his father and DW.2 in turn handing over the said cheque to the complainant as security for the loan borrowed by him does not inspire confidence of the Court.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n15. Sri. H.R.Showri, learned counsel for the petitioner - accused seeks to assail the impugned order of conviction and sentence on the following grounds: i) Though there is presumption under Section 139 of NI Act regarding issuance of the cheque towards discharge of liability, that is a rebutable presumption. It was sufficient for the accused to rebut that by preponderance of probability; ii)  The moment DW.2 entered the witness box and said that he had received the cheque from the accused and handed over the same to the complainant, the presumption under Sections 118 and 139 of NI Act stood rebutted and then it was for the complainant to prove how he came in possession of the cheque and iii) The First Appellate court did not consider the additional evidence adduced by the accused at all. Thereby, the First Appellate Court failed to exercise its jurisdiction to re-appreciate the evidence. Therefore, the matter requires remand.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n16. Per contra, Sri.Kamaraju, learned counsel for the complainant - respondent seeks to justify the order of conviction and sentence passed by the Courts below on the following grounds: i) Since both the Courts on appreciation and re- appreciation of the evidence rejected the defence of the accused, this Court in revisional jurisdiction cannot interfere with the same. ii) There is no illegality, perversity in the orders of the Courts below; iii) The documents produced by the accused and the evidence of DWs.1 and 2 are totally unworthy of acceptance and iv) Absolutely, there was no material to show that the father of the accused had borrowed loan from DW.2, in that connection the cheque was handed over to him and he in turn handed over the cheque to the complainant.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n10. The trial Court on hearing the parties by the judgment and order dated 18.07.2009 rejected the defence of the accused and convicted him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of NI Act and sentenced him to fine of Rs.5,000/-. Further, the trial Court awarded compensation of Rs.3,50,000/- to the complainant and in default to pay compensation directed that the accused shall undergo simple imprisonment for one year. The First Appellate Court by the order dated 21.03.2011, allowed the said application and directed the trial Court to record the additional evidence on the documents produced by the accused and resubmit the records.\n",
    "Case_Result": "6. Since the accused did not pay the cheque amount, the complainant filed complaint before the Prl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Shivamogga in PCR No.171/2006 to prosecute the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act. The learned Magistrate on taking cognizance of the offence, registered the case in C.C.No.767/2006 summoned the accused and tried him.7. In support of his case, the complainant got examined himself as PW.1, the Assistant Manager of South Indian Bank as PW.2 and the clerk of Vishweshwarayya Co-operative Society as PW.3. The accused in defence got examined himself as DW.1 and Hanumanthappa as DW.2 and got marked Exs.D1 to D4.8. The accused admitted that the cheque Ex.P1 pertained to his account and it was bearing his signature. His only defence was that he had issued the said cheque to DW.2 as security for the loan borrowed by his deceased father.  According to him, DW.2 Hanumanthappa had borrowed loan from the complainant and as security for repayment of the said loan, he had collected some cheques drawn in his favour by Hanumanthappa along with Ex.P1. It was alleged that after repayment of the loan, the complainant had not returned Ex.P1 to Hanumanthappa.9. It is material to note that in his reply notice Ex.D1 he had not taken such defence. He had only stated that he does not know how the cheque reached the custody of the complainant. He claimed to have issued the notice Ex.D2 simultaneously to Hanumanthappa on 27.04.2006 calling upon him to return the cheque Ex.P1. Only during the trial he produced Ex.D4 - the reply notice purportedly issued by Hanumanthappa where Hanumanthappa purportedly accepted to have received the blank signed cheque issued by him and handing over the same to complainant.17. The accused admitted that Ex.P1 pertains to his account and it bears his signature. Therefore, the presumption as contemplated under Section 118 and 139 of NI Act that the cheque was issued by the accused towards discharge of his liability arises.When the accused contended that he had handed over the said cheque to DW.2 as security for repayment of loan borrowed by his deceased father and in turn DW.2 handed over the said cheque to the complainant as security for the loan borrowed by him from the complainant, the burden was on him to prove the said defence by acceptable evidence.18. The accused should have shown that his late father had borrowed loan from DW.2 and in that connection the said cheque was issued. He was further expected to show that DW.2 had borrowed loan from the complainant and as security for the said loan, he had given Ex.P1 to the complainant.19. Apparently, the theory of the accused handing over the cheque to DW.2 started to surface only after the complainant issuing notice Ex.P3. In Ex.D1, the reply notice the accused simply said that Ex.P1 cheque was handed over to DW.2. The particulars of the alleged loan borrowed by his father i.e., amount of the loan borrowed, the date and time of such borrowing and handing over of the cheque to DW.2 were conspicuously absent in Ex.D1.20. At the first instance in support of his defence, accused produced only Exs.D1 to D4. Ex.D4 reply was purportedly issued by DW.2 to the accused on 08.05.2006. In that, for the first time DW.2 introduces the theory of he receiving the cheque from the accused towards the loan borrowed by the father of the accused and handing over the same to the complainant as security for the loan borrowed from the complainant. DW.2 also claims that since the complainant without returning the documents misused the cheque, he filed a police complaint against the complainant. Again in the reply Ex.D4 the particulars of the loan borrowed by the father of the accused were absent.21. Though DW2 claimed that he filed police complaint against the complainant, no FIR was produced. While adducing the additional evidence he tried to get a copy of the complaint purportedly submitted by him to the Circle Police Inspector, Kote police station Shivamogga in evidence. That document was not admitted in evidence as it was only a secondary evidence. Even on that document, there was no seal or signature of any Police Officer receiving the complaint.22. Further, DWs.1 and 2 also did not give particulars of the loan allegedly borrowed by the father of the accused from DW.2. DW.2 in his cross- examination stated that he does not remember when and how much loan accused had borrowed and he also does not remember the accused repaying the same. He himself admitted that he has not filed any complaint before the police against the complainant for not returning the cheque. Though he again tried to say that he has filed such complaint, he himself stated that he has not filed any document regarding the same.23. Attempt was made to contend that in the cross-examination of DW.1, Exs.D5 to D13 more particularly Ex.D10 were not disputed, therefore, the First Appellate Court should have accepted that. Apparently, Exs.D5 to D13 were produced after about five years of issuance of notice. Except the self serving statement of the accused, none else were examined to prove Ex.D10. There were in-built inconsistencies in Ex.D10 and the evidence of the accused. In Ex.D2 accused claimed that he had given only one cheque, but Ex.D10 states that in all five cheques were given to DW.2. If Ex.D10 was executed by accused on 28.02.2005 as reflected therein, then in his reply notice there should have been a reference to that.24. DW.1 himself stated that his father had borrowed loan in 1991 and at that time he was minor. Nothing was produced to show that the said loan was outstanding upto 2006. DW.1 in his cross- examination stated that the loan borrowed by his father was Rs.1,00,000/- but Ex.D10 states that loan borrowed by his father was Rs.2,51,000/-. DW.1 states that since 1991 DW.2 never demanded repayment of the loan. If that was the case, why he issued cheques was not explained.25. Though later the accused claimed that he had issued several cheques to DW.2 and they were collected, the statement of account pertaining to his account was not produced. Thus it is clear that the documents produced by the accused in his evidence for the first time before the trial Court and adduced by way of additional evidence at appellate stage were only fabricated to make a defence. Therefore, the first appellate Court in para 19 of the judgment held that the defence of the accused and the evidence led by him in support of that defence is unacceptable.Thus it is clear that mere probabalizing itself is not sufficient, but such evidence adduced to rebut the presumption should be acceptable. Petition dismissed",

Bharath Kumar, for respondent are present. . With the consent of the learned counsel appearing for the parties, matter is taken up for final disposal. The petition is presented under Section 397 read with Section 401 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 against the Judgment dated 02.02.2015 passed by the Presiding Officer, Fast Track Court-XV, Bangalore, in Criminal Appeal No.294/2012 wherein the appeal came to be dismissed, thereby the Judgment passed by the trial Court came to be confirmed. In order to avoid confusion and overlapping, the parties are referred to in accordance with the rankings held by them in the trial Court. . The substance of the complaint is that the accused approached the complainant for financial assistance in the form of hand loan during the month of November - 2007 for Rs. 5,75,000/- for his urgent business purpose and the complainant advanced the same to the accused on 21.11.2007. The amount was lent in the form of cash. Accused agreed to repay the amount within two years, but he committed default, however, he issued a Cheque bearing No.763105 dated 03.04.2010 for a sum of Rs. 5,75,000/- drawn on ABN AMRO Bank, Prestige Towers, Residency Road, Bangalore. On presentation of the said Cheque for encashment by the complainant in his collecting banker - Bank of India, the said Cheque was dishonored and returned on 05.04.2010 with an endorsement as \"Account Closed\".  The complainant issued a legal notice on 27.04.2010. In spite of legal notice got issued, neither the amount was repaid nor the terms of the notice were complied. Accordingly, a criminal case came to be presented against the accused on 21.05.2010. . After taking cognizance of the offence, on summons accused appeared and pleaded not guilty and came to be tried the complainant adduced the evidence as PW1 and got marked the documents Exs.P1 to P7. On behalf of accused, the accused was examined as DW1 and an Electricity Bill was marked as Ex.D1. 9. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, accused preferred an appeal in Crl.A. No.294/2014 before the appellate Court that came to be dismissed and the judgment passed by the trial Court came to be confirmed. Aggrieved by it, the present revision is preferred by the accused.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: 8.

Act.\\n\\nThe accused shall pay a fine of Rs. 5,80,000/-. In default of payment of said fine amount, the accused shall undergo simple imprisonment for Six Months.\\n\\nOut of the said amount, Rs. 5,75,000/- shall be paid to the complainant as compensation, as provided U/s.357 of Cr.PC., and Rs. 5,000/- shall be remitted to the State as fine.'\n**Argument by Petitioner**: Learned counsel Sri Ismail Musba for the accused/petitioner would submit that the complainant is not entitled for the relief prayed for by him nor the accused to undergo liability.  He would further submit that the de novo trial should have been the substance of the case and it is no where applicable for a subsequent Magistrate to rely on the evidence on record. In this regard, he relied on Section 262 of Cr.P.C., and the decisions of Hon'ble Supreme Court as under:  Further, the learned counsel for the petitioner-accused submitted that the case falls on another material lapse, whereas the accused is not examined under Section 313 of Cr.P.C.,\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Learned counsel for the complainant refuting the stand taken by the petitioner, would submit that a legally enforceable debt was existed. Accused issued a Cheque that came to be dishonored. In the circumstances, there is presence of all the ingredients for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act (for short 'N.I. Act') and the legal objections raised by the counsel for the petitioner is not tenable.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  In the context and circumstances of the case, basically there is a complaint for the offence under Section 138 of N.I. Act, which came to be filed against the petitioner. The Cheque bearing No.763105 dated 03.04.2010 for Rs. 5,75,000/- issued by the petitioner was presented to the Bank by the complainant for payment and it came to be dishonored and the legal notice was issued by the complainant to the petitioner. As the accused neither replied nor repaid the Cheque amount within stipulated time, a criminal case was instituted. Evidence was adduced by the complainant and the accused as stated above.  Ultimately the accused came to be convicted by the trial Judge, which came to confirmed by the appellate Court by dismissing the appeal filed by the accused/petitioner. The contention of the petitioner/accused earlier has been that he has obtained a LIC policy and he had issued a Cheque. However, no details of policy amount, premium amount and even duration are mentioned. As such it appears that such a defence is taken for the sake of defence without there being any substance in it.  Before this Court, the learned counsel for the accused/petitioner submits that the evidence was recorded by the Magistrate in the trial Court and the judgment was pronounced and the appreciation was by the Successor Magistrate. As such the enquiry is vitiated. He relied upon Sections 362 and 326 of Cr.P.C. He would further stress that under Section 461 of Cr.P.C., the proceedings are vitiated as there is material irregularity. He also relied upon the citations referred supra and submitted the case falls on material lapse that the accused was not examined under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. I find the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner/accused has no legal force in it.  Further insofar as the contention of the petitioner/accused that the Magistrate has not examined the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C., is concerned, the examination of the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. is an important stage in criminal proceedings and non-examination definitely would imply either there are no incriminating scircumstances against the accused or it is left as lapse.\n",

The appellant filed a complaint before the V Additional I Civil Judge and JMFC, Mysuru, under section 200 read with section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as \"N.I. Act\") alleging that the respondent (hereinafter referred to as the \"accused\") approached him for financial assistance for his oats feeds (horse feeds) business and borrowed a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- on 18.10.2007 through cheque bearing No.488842 of State Bank of India agreeing to repay the same with interest at 18% per annum within 3 or 4 months. The accused did not return the loan amount within the stipulated time, instead again approached the complainant in the first week of June, 2008 seeking further financial assistance to the tune of Rs.25,00,000/-. As per the assurance given by the accused to repay the same along with the previous loan amount within one year along with interest, the complainant lent another sum of Rs.20,00,000/- to the accused on 08.06.2008 through cheques bearing Nos.065793 and 065794 of State Bank of India.  In repayment of the said amount, the accused issued a cheque bearing No.273840 drawn on Syndicate Bank for a sum of Rs.46,74,000/- dated 17.5.2010 being the principal amount with upto date interest. The said cheque when presented for encashment was returned unpaid for \"funds insufficient\". The complainant issued a legal notice on 08.06.2010 and initiated action against the accused under section 138 of N.I. Act.  Before the trial court, the complainant examined himself as PW.1 and produced in evidence the original cheque Ex.P1, Bank Memo Ex.P2,Copy of legal notice Ex.P3, Postal acknowledgement Ex.P5, Cheque returned register extract Ex.P6 and Bank account extract Ex.P7. He also examined PW.2 Sri.G.Jairam. Feeling aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order, the complainant has preferred this appeal. I have heard learned counsel for appellant and learned counsel for respondent and perused the records.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n5. The contention of the learned counsel for the complainant is that the accused having admitted the receipt of Rs.28,00,000/- and also having put forth a plea of discharge, in the absence of any material to show the repayment of the cheque amount, by virtue of the presumption under Section 139 of N.I. Act, the Trial Court could not have dismissed the complaint in entirety.  Further, referring to para 12 of the impugned judgment, he submitted that the learned Magistrate having come to the conclusion that the accused owed Rs.38,62,000/-, as on the date of the dishonour of the cheque, ought to have presumed that the cheque was issued towards discharge of the aforesaid debt or liability. Placing reliance on the decision of this Court in S. Parameshwarappa and Another v/s S. Choodappa, 2007 CRI.L.J. 586, the learned counsel emphasized that once the cheque is issued, the accused cannot contend that it is not in respect of the legally enforceable debt, as the complainant had established in evidence, that the amount \"was due\" by the accused as on the date of issuance of the cheque.  In other words, it is the argument of the learned counsel, that the proceedings before the learned Magistrate was one for dishonour of the cheque and not for recovery of a debt before the Civil Court wherein the plaintiff is required to prove his claim based on evidence, whereas in an action under Section 138 of N.I. Act, on proof of issuance of the cheque, the onus shifts to the accused to rebut the presumption that the cheque was issued not for discharge of any debt or liability in terms of Section 138 of N.I. Act. Therefore, the learned Magistrate could not have dismissed the complaint solely on account of discrepancy in determination of the amount, based on the oral evidence of the parties, contrary to the tenor of the document.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n. In rebuttal, the accused examined himself as DW.1. In his evidence, while admitting the receipt of Rs.8,00,000/- from the complainant, the accused took up a plea that on 06.12.2007, the complainant purchased a property and at that time, he refunded Rs.8,00,000/- and further paid another sum of Rs.10,00,000/- to the complainant. After few days, the complainant returned Rs.10,00,000/- and thus he was due only a sum of Rs.10,00,000/-.  He further contended that for recovery of the said amount, the complainant filed a civil suit. As the complainant promised to withdraw the said suit, the accused paid him another sum of Rs.5,00,000/- and thus, in his evidence, the accused took up a stand that he owed only a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- to the complainant. Further he deposed that during the above transaction, the complainant had taken eight blank cheques and eight blank stamp papers from him and the same have been used by the complainant to lay a false claim and thus sought to dismiss the complaint. In the course of cross-examination, the accused admitted receipt of Rs.28,00,000/- from the complainant on 22.10.2007 and 10.06.2008 by way of cheques.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n4. Considering the above evidence, learned Magistrate dismissed the complaint returning a finding that the complainant failed to prove the legal liability due by the accused as on the date of issuance of the cheque, for the reason that in his legal notice as well as in his evidence, the complainant asserted that the accused had borrowed the aforesaid amount from him undertaking to repay the same with interest at 18% per annum, if so, the total amount due to the complainant as on the date of the cheque would come to Rs.38,62,000/- and not Rs.46,74,000/- as reflected in the cheque. Thus concluding that there was no legally enforceable debt of Rs.46,74,000/- as on the date of presentation of the cheque, learned Magistrate by referring to Head Notes of various decisions, dismissed the complaint.\n",
    "Case_Result": "6. The learned advocate for the accused, however, argued in support of the impugned judgment, contending that the complainant having failed to establish that the amount of Rs.46,74,000/- shown in the dishonoured cheque was in fact due and payable to the complainant as on the date of presentation of the cheque, the trial court was justified in dismissing the complaint, as the accused could not have drawn the subject cheque towards discharge of the alleged liability.7. I have considered these submissions in the light of the pleadings and the evidence adduced by the parties.8. In appreciating the contentions urged by the accused, it is important to note that, in his evidence before the Court, the accused (DW.1) has unequivocally admitted receipt of Rs.8,00,000/- as loan from the complainant and has further stated that he had agreed to pay interest thereon at the rate of 3% per annum. Further he deposed that on 06.12.2007, the complainant had purchased a property and had approached him and at that time, he repaid Rs.8,00,000/- and further paid another sum of Rs.10,00,000/-, in all Rs.18,00,000/-, to the complainant. He has even gone to the extent of stating that the complainant added another Rs.10,00,000/-, which was with him, and paid Rs.28,00,000/- to his vendor and after few days, the complainant returned Rs.10,00,000/- received by him and therefore, he (accused) was due only Rs.10,00,000/- to the complainant. He further asserted that the complainant filed a civil suit for recovery of the said amount, but on the promise of the complainant to withdraw the said suit, he (accused) repaid another sum of Rs.5,00,000/- and thus, he was due to pay only Rs.5,00,000/- to the complainant. Further he deposed that he had issued a reply to the legal notice issued by the complainant and further stated that he had \"given\" 8 blank cheques and 8 blank stamp papers to the complainant.9. In the cross-examination, when a specific suggestion was made to the accused (DW.1) that a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- was credited to his account through cheque on 22.10.2007 and Rs.10,00,000/- each by way of two cheques on 10.06.2008 and Rs.3,00,000/- on 23.11.2007, the accused plainly answered that he had received only Rs.28,00,000/-. Thus, the accused ended up in admitting the receipt of Rs.28,00,000/-.10. On going through the entire evidence on record, I find this is the only fact that has been proved by the complainant. Undeniably the cheque in question stands for Rs.46,74,000/-. The accused has not denied the issuance of the subject cheque. Instead in the course of his evidence, he has taken a faint / vague plea that he had \"given\" 8 blank cheques and 8 blank stamp papers to the complainant. He has not elaborated on this aspect nor has he stated the circumstance under which he had \"given\" 8 blank cheques and 8 blank stamp papers to the complainant.11. There is a presumption that until contrary is proved, every negotiable instrument duly executed, is for discharge of a debt or a liability. It is not the case of the accused that he either signed 8 cheques or parted with them under any threat or coercion nor is it the case of the accused that the cheques \"given\" by him were not towards the discharge of any debt or liability due or payable by him to the complainant.3. In the light of this legal proposition and in the absence of any contra evidence by the accused that cheque in question was not voluntarily \"given\" by him to the complainant, it may be reasonably presumed that the cheque in question was issued by the accused towards discharge of the legally enforceable debt due by him.14. In the backdrop of the above conclusion, it is significant to note that section 139 of the N.I. Act mandates that the Court shall presume the liability of the drawer of a cheque for the amount for which the cheque is drawn. Nevertheless, the presumption contemplated under section 139 of the N.I. Act is a rebuttable presumption which lays down that unless the contrary is proved, it has to be presumed that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in section 138 of N.I. Act, for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability.15. In the instant case, the complainant has been able to prove that only a sum of Rs.28,00,000/- was due to him as on the date of the presentation of the subject cheque for encashment. Though he has contended that the amount of Rs.46,74,000/- mentioned in Ex.P1 cheque included the interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the principal amount borrowed by the accused, but as discussed above, no material is produced by the complainant in proof of the claim of interest at the rate of 18% per annum. As a result, the amount reflected in the cheque cannot be reconciled to the actual amount due and payable by the accused. 17. Section 138 of the N.I. Act does not bar the conviction of the accused if the debt or liability due by him is found less than the amount reflected in the cheque as long as it is proved that the cheque in question was voluntarily issued in discharge of the whole or part of the debt. The difference in the amount shown in the cheque and the actual amount due by the drawer as on the date of presentation of the cheque may be relevant factor to determine the fine or compensation for the loss caused to the complainant, but the said discrepancy cannot absolve the accused of the consequence of dishonour of the cheque. If such a position is accepted, it would defeat the object of Chapter XVII of the N.I. Act as the drawer of the cheque could conveniently avert the prosecution under Section 138 of the N.I. Act by making payment of a part or fraction of the cheque amount thereby bringing about discrepancy and incongruity in the amount shown in the cheque and the actual amount due as on the date of presentation of the cheque. Therefore, I am unable to accept the reasoning of the Trial Court that on account of the discrepancy in the amount reflected in the cheque and the actual amount due by the accused, the accused cannot be proceeded under section 138 of the N.I. Act. In that view of the matter, the impugned judgment, in my view, cannot be sustained.8. However, insofar as the award of fine or compensation is concerned, the evidence adduced by the parties with regard to the alleged agreement between the parties to pay interest and the long lapse of time taken by the accused to repay the amount to the complainant may be a factor which requires to be considered in view of the law laid down by the Apex Court in M/s Meters and Instruments Private Limited vs. Kanchan Mehta, 2018(1) SCC 560 : (AIR 2017 SC 4594), wherein it is held: Appeal allowed",

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe core issue of this case revolves around determining whether the lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was correct. The appellant alleges that the respondent borrowed a sum of Rs.8,00,000/- and Rs.20,00,000/- on 18.10.2007 and 08.06.2008, respectively, with a promise to repay the loans within a stipulated time. When the respondent failed to repay the loans, the appellant issued a cheque for Rs.46,74,000/- on 17.5.2010, which was dishonoured due to \"funds insufficient.\" The appellant filed a complaint under section 138 of the N.I. Act, alleging that the respondent had issued the cheque knowing it would be dishonoured.\n\nThe lower court dismissed the complaint, finding that the appellant failed to prove a legally enforceable debt of Rs.46,74,000/- as on the date of the cheque. The court relied on the respondent's evidence that the total amount due to the appellant as on the date of the cheque was Rs.38,62,000/- and not Rs.46,74,000/-, as reflected in the cheque.\n\nIn our assessment, the lower court erred in its application of the law. Once the cheque is issued, the burden shifts to the respondent to rebut the presumption that the cheque was issued not for discharge of any debt or liability. The respondent's explanation of a reduced debt due to the return of a portion of the loan does not exonerate him from the presumption created under section 139 of the N.I. Act.\n\nTherefore, we allow the appeal and set aside the lower court's judgment. The complaint under section 138 of the N.I. Act is sustained. The respondent is directed to pay the due amount along with interest thereon at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of the dishonour of the cheque till realization."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nAshok G. NijagannavarAshok G. NijagannavarSCC 74 Gururaj JoshiRamakrishnaM. R. Hiremathad1. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order of acquittal dated 05.07.2011 passed in C.C.No.1575/2009, whereby the respondent-accused is acquitted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, (hereinafter referred to as N.I.Act) and also praying to pass an order to convict the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. 2. The brief facts of the case are that the appellant- complainant and the respondent-accused were known to each other. The appellant-complainant had given a loan of Rs.1,50,000/- to the respondent-accused for his family necessities through a cheque bearing No.146341 for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- drawn on Canara Bank, P.J.Extension, Davanagere, and also paid a sum of Rs.50,000/- in cash. The respondent-accused, having failed to pay the amount within a reasonable time, had issued three cheques bearing Nos.981735, 981736 and 981737 dated 01.03.2006, 01.04.2006 and 01.05.2006 respectively, for a sum of Rs.50,000/- each, drawn on Laxmi Villas Bank, Davanagere Branch.  The said cheques were presented to bank for encashment but they were dishonoured and returned with an endorsement \"funds insufficient\". The appellant-complainant got issued legal notice dated 22.05.2006, but it was returned with a shara \"not claimed\". Since the respondent-accused failed to repay the loan amount, the appellant-complainant filed a private compliant under Section 200 Cr.P.C. for the offence punishable under Section 138 N.I.Act. On recording the sworn statement, the case was registered at C.C.No.1575/2009. The charges were read over, but the accused denied the same and claimed to be tried. The complainant got himself examined as P.W.1 and documents were marked as per Exs.P-1 to P-14. The respondent-accused has not led any evidence, but a letter issued by TATA AIG Life Insurance Company Ltd., is got marked as Ex.D-1 during the course of cross-examination, D.W.1.  Heard Sri Gururaj Joshi, learned counsel for the appellant-complainant and Sri Ramakrishna, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Sri M.R.Hiremathad, learned counsel for the respondent- accused and perused the judgment and records.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n5. Learned counsel for the appellant-complainant would contend that the trial Court has rightly came to the conclusion that the appellant-complainant has discharged his burden in proving the financial capacity to lend money, issuance of cheque by the respondent-accused, service of legal notice.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n6. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-accused supported the decision of the trial Court and further submitted that there are no valid grounds to interfere with the order passed by the trial Court. There is ample evidence on record to show that there was a transaction of insurance policy and respondent-accused has issued a cheque towards payment of premium in respect of the policy taken by him that it is also the contention of respondent- accused there was a chit transaction between the accused and the complainant. Considering all these facts, the trial Court has rightly come to the conclusion that the appellant-complainant has intentionally issued legal notice to the wrong address and has managed to file a false case against the respondent- accused. There is no convincing evidence to show that the respondent-accused has committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. Thus, the appeal deserves to be dismissed.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n3. The trial Court, on analysis of the evidence adduced by the appellant-complainant, arrived at a factual finding that the respondent-accused had duly issued cheques in question for a sum of Rs.50,000/- each in favour of the appellant-complainant in discharge of a debt or liability. The cheques, were presented to the Bank for payment within the time of validity, but the cheques were returned unpaid for want of funds in the account of the respondent- accused in the bank on which the cheques were drawn. However, the trial Court was of the opinion that appellant- complainant ought to have issued a notice under Certificate of Posting (COP) in addition to the notice sending through Registered Post with Acknowledgment Due (RPAD). With the said observation, the trial Court has come to the conclusion that the contention of the appellant-complainant that he intimated the respondent- accused regarding dishonour of the cheque leads to suspicion as the P.W.1 has also admitted in the cross-examination to a suggestion made by the respondent-accused that the appellant- complainant has not sent the legal notice to his correct address. \n",
    "Case_Result": "Further it is observed that the appellant-complainant has not sent the legal notice to the respondent-accused under certificate of posting, there is no presumption of proper service of notice to the respondent-accused and has further held that the appellant-complainant has failed to prove that he had intimated the respondent-accused regarding dishonour of cheques and nothing on record that respondent- accused has received intimation. With these observations, the complaint came to be dismissed. Being aggrieved by the said order of acquittal, the appellant-complainant is before this Court.All these findings have not been challenged, the only error committed by the trial Court is dismissing the complaint on the reason that notice was not sent under certificate of posting. The said finding of the trial Court is erroneous. The documentary evidence placed on record clearly goes to show that legal notice was sent through registered post acknowledgment due. Ex.P-12 the envelope, which is returned as unclaimed, clearly goes to show that there was proper service of notice as required under Section 17 of General Clauses Act. However, the trial Court has failed to consider this aspect. Thus, it has resulted in miscarriage of justice.8. In the present appeal, the legal principles regarding presumption to be drawn regarding service of legal notice to the respondent-accused is under consideration.gThus, it is necessary to ascertain whether there was proper service of notice as per the procedure prescribed under Section 94 of Negotiable Instruments Act and the provisions of General Clauses Act.12. On analysis of the evidence placed on record, trial Court has arrived at the factual finding that the respondent-accused had duly issued three cheques as per Exs.P-1, P-2 and P-3 for a sum of Rs.50,000/- each towards discharge of legally payable debt. The said cheques were presented to the bank for payment within the period of its validity, but the said cheques were dishonoured for want of funds and returned with an endorsement of bank \"insufficient funds\" in the account of respondent-accused in the bank on which the cheques were drawn. The statutory notice of dishonour was duly issued, to which there was no response from the respondent-accused. The trial Court has rightly came to the conclusion that the appellant-complainant had financial capacity to lend money. The trial Court has also rightly disbelieved Ex.D-1 which is envelope confronted during the evidence of D.W.1 on the reason that the respondent-accused has not placed cogent evidence to show that the cheques issued by him in favour of the complainant is towards payment of premium. It is rightly held that when the accused admits Exs.P-1 to P-3 belongs to him and the signatures on the said cheques are also admitted by him, it is for the respondent-accused to prove that the said cheques were issued towards payment of premium installments of insurance policy. There is no plausible explanation by the respondent-accused as to why Exs.P-1 to P-3 were issued in the name of appellant- complainant.13. In the present appeal, the trial Court has dismissed the complaint only on the reason that the legal notice issued through RPAD to respondent-accused was returned un-served as 'not claimed'. The postal cover sent through RPAD returned as not claimed does not mean due service of notice. Even during the course of cross-examination of P.W.1, nothing has been elicited regarding service of notice. When the appellant-complainant has not sent the legal notice to the respondent-accused under certificate of posting, there is no presumption of due service of notice to the respondent-accused. It is pertinent to note that the respondent-accused has not placed rebuttal evidence to prove that the notice was not sent to the correct address and the respondent- accused was not working at the address shown in the envelope sent through legal notice. Ex.P-12 is the legal notice postal cover, the address shown in the said postal cover and the address shown in the cause title of the complaint are one and the same. The respondent- accused has not at all denied that he was working as Health Inspector at the City Municipality Council, Davanagere.14. When a sender has dispatched the notice through registered post with correct address written on it, Section 27 of General Clauses Act could be profitably imported and in such a situation service of notice deemed to have been effected on the sender unless he proves that it was really not served and he was not responsible for such non-service. In the present case, there is no rebuttal evidence to show that the complainant has deliberately and intentionally sent the legal notice to the wrong address and the accused was not working at the place and address shown in the registered envelope.

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. The present petitioner as the accused was tried by the Court of the learned Civil Judge (Jr.Dn.) and Judicial Magistrate First Class, Sagar, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"Trial Court\") in C.C.No.706/2011, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"N.I. Act\") and was convicted for the said offence by its judgment of conviction and order on sentence dated 26-10-2013. Aggrieved by the same, the accused preferred a Criminal Appeal in the Court of the V Additional District and Sessions Judge, Shivamogga sitting at Sagar (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"Sessions Judge's Court\") in Criminal Appeal No.273/2013. The appeal was contested by the respondent who was the complainant in the Trial Court.  Aggrieved by the impugned judgments and order on sentence, the accused has preferred this revision petition. . The summary of the case of the complainant in the Trial Court is that, the accused being well known to him, had borrowed a sum of '1,50,000/- from him in the month of March 2010, agreeing to repay the same along with interest thereupon within three months. Since the accused did not repay the loan amount within the agreed period, at the demand made by the complainant, he issued a cheque bearing No.719054 dated 16-06-2010, drawn on Syndicate Bank, Ankola Branch, in favour of the complainant, for a sum of '1,50,000/-. When the said cheque was presented for its realisation, the same came to be dis-honoured and returned with the banker's shara \"A/c closed\". According to the complainant, thereafter, he got issued a legal notice to the accused, which was sent to him through Registered Post Acknowledgement Due (RPAD) as well Under Certificate of Posting (UCP). Though the notice sent through Registered Post Acknowledgement Due was returned with an endorsement, \"out of station - intimation delivered - left-address not known\" but the notice sent Under Certificate of Posting is served upon the accused. Still, the accused did not meet the demand made in the notice, which constrained the complainant to institute the present criminal case against the accused. The accused, who contested the matter in the Trial Court, got himself examined as DW-1 and got marked two documents at Exhibits D-1 and D-2. Being aggrieved by the same, the accused has preferred this revision petition.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n11. Learned counsel for the petitioner/accused in his argument submitted that, he would place his case before the Court on the grounds that, there is no service of notice upon the accused after the dishonour of the cheque, which service of notice is mandated under law. He further submits that, the complainant had no financial capacity to lend the money to the accused. Finally stating that, since prior to the date of the alleged loan transaction till the year 2011, the accused was pursuing his avocation at Bengaluru, as such, the question of he availing any loan from the complainant does not arise. 21. The other point of argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner/accused was about the alleged financial incapacity of the complainant to lend such a huge amount as loan. \nArgument by the Respondent:\n. The accused appeared in the Trial Court and contested the matter through his counsel. He pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried, as such, the Trial Court proceeded to record the evidence wherein, to prove his case, the complainant got examined himself as PW-1 and got marked documents from Exhibits P-1 to P-8.  12. Per Contra, the learned counsel for the respondent/ complainant, in his argument, submitted that, the summons issued by the Trial Court has been served upon the accused on his address to which address only the legal notice under Registered Post Acknowledgement Due (RPAD) was sent. Therefore, there is service of notice upon the accused. He further submits that Ex.D-1 is not believable and there are no material to show that, the accused was living at Bengaluru at the relevant point of time.  He also submits that, in the cross-examination of PW-1, it has come out that, the accused after selling the art and craft works of the complainant, had paid him a sum of '1,24,964/-, which itself would go to show that, the complainant had financial capacity to lend money. 18. Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant submitted that, the notice sent to the accused in the criminal case was served upon his address which was his native place address at Kumta, to which the legal notice was sent, as such, the accused cannot deny the service of notice upon him.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe Sessions Judge's Court in its judgment dated 08-07-2015 dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the Trial Court in C.C.No.706/2011.  4. The Trial Court after recording the evidence led before it, by its impugned judgment of conviction dated 26-10-2013 convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him to pay a total fine amount of '1,55,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months. Challenging the same, the accused preferred an appeal in Criminal Appeal No.273/2013 before the learned Session's Judge's Court, which after hearing both side, by its judgment dated 08-07-2015, dismissed the appeal, while confirming the judgment of conviction passed by the Trial Court.\n",
    "Case_Result": "7. Heard the arguments from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court including the Trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records.8. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth referred to as per their rankings before the Trial Court.10. It is an admitted fact that, the accused and the complainant were known to each other and both of them were artisans and making handicraft art pieces. According to the complainant, he was doing sandalwood carving activity. It is also not in dispute that, the complainant had got a brother-in- law by name Sri.G.K. Kurudekar, who was also known to the accused. It is not in dispute that, the drawer of the cheque at Exhibit P-1 is the accused and the said cheque, when presented for realisation, the same came to be dis-honoured and returned with the banker's memo, \"A/c closed\". It is in these un-disputed facts, the case is required to be analysed.It is on this aspect, the accused's contention is that, there was no possibility of service of any notice upon him since he was residing at Bengaluru at the relevant point of time. Thus, the learned counsel for the petitioner/accused in his argument gave more emphasis on his first point of argument on the alleged non-service of notice upon the accused.13. The cheque at Exhibit P-1, no doubt, shows the name of the payee as that of the complainant and admittedly, the said cheque, when presented for its realisation, came to be dis- honoured and returned with the banker's shara \"A/c closed\" as evidenced in Exhibit P-2, which is the banker's endorsement/memo. It is thereafter, according to the complainant, a notice demanding the payment of the cheque amount was sent by him to the accused, which notice sent through Registered Post Acknowledgement Due (RPAD) came to be returned un-served, whereas the notice sent Under Certificate of Posting (UCP) has not been returned. 14. PW-1 in his examination-in-chief itself has stated that, he sent notice to the accused, both Under Certificate of Posting (UCP) as well under Registered Post Acknowledgement Due (RPAD). But, he himself has stated in the very same examination-in-chief that, notice sent under Registered Post Acknowledgement Due has been returned to him un-delivered. He has also admitted a suggestion to that effect as true in his cross-examination. Though he contends that, the notice was also sent through Certificate of Posting, as could be seen in the postal certificate at Exhibit P-7, but, admittedly no document/proof regarding the service of any letter sent Under Certificate of Posting would be available, because, there is no such practice of issuing of any certificate of service. No doubt, if the address shown of the addressee therein is found to be correct and if it is established that the postal article was sent with the correct and complete address of the addressee, by paying necessary postage and duly dispatched for delivery, then, under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, a presumption can be drawn. It is in that regard, even though the complainant contends that, the notice sent to the accused Under Certificate of Posting has been served upon him, the same requires to be tested and analysed.15. The returned postal article sent through Registered Post Acknowledgment Due which is at Exhibit P-5 would go to show that, it has been returned with the postal shara, which is dated 12-07-2010 showing it as \"out of station - intimation\". The very same postman, on a subsequent endorsement dated 20-07-2010 in the very same postal article, has made an endorsement as \"Left - Address not known\". This makes it very clear that, though the postman had initially appears to have issued an intimation regarding the arrival of the postal article, but during the retention period of the postal article, he came to know that the addressee has left the place and his current (then) address was not known. As such, it is that postal shara with which the article has been returned to the sender, has to be considered, which shows that, the addressee had left the address. Therefore, admittedly, the Registered Post Acknowledgement Due stood returned to the sender.16. According to the complainant, the notice sent to the very same address Under Certificate of Posting has been served upon the accused. In that regard, he has produced a Certificate of Posting at Exhibit P-7, which shows that such a posting was made addressed to the present address of the accused. It is known to everyone that Certificate of Posting could only show that, such a posting was made to a particular address, but it would not certify the receipt of such an article by the addressee in the said Certificate. However, if it is established that, the said address shown in the postal article is the correct, complete and then residing address of the accused and if it is shown that it has been duly stamped and dispatched for delivery, a presumption can be drawn in favour of the sender.However, in the instant case, no documents are produced by the complainant to show that, the accused was residing at that particular address at the relevant point of time, which is shown in the postal article at Exhibit P-5 and the Certificate of Posting at Exhibit P-7. As observed in the previous paragraph, the postal article sent under Registered Post Acknowledgement Due has been returned with the postal shara \"addressee left and his address not known\", which means, the very same postal authority has put it in writing, stating that, the addressee has left the address and his address was not known. In such an event, even if the unregistered postal article is sent Under Certificate of Posting to the very same address, then the said article, may, at the maximum, be delivered in that address, but not to the person named as addressee in the letter, since the addressee has already left the address.17. In support of the above analysis, Ex.D-1 also can be considered, which is a letter of employment shown to have been issued by the alleged employer of the accused, stating that, from the year 2007 upto the year 2011, the accused was working in a firm by name \"The Oriental Haveli\" Koramangala, Bengaluru. It was suggested to PW-1 in his cross-examination that, from the year 2007 to 2011, the accused was working in an establishment at Bengaluru, however, the complainant has stated that, he had no information in that regard. In furtherance of such a contention, the accused has produced the said Exhibit D-1, however, the complainant in his cross-examination did not deny the genuinity and authenticity of the said document at Ex.D-1, rather, he elicited some more details as to, who was the author of the said document, for which, the accused has stated that, it was his Manager. Therefore, it can be stated that the accused has placed evidence to show that, at the relevant point of time, he was residing at Bengaluru.19. In that regard, the following two points can be noticed. [a] If according to the complainant, the accused was residing at Kumta, at the time when the legal notice and the Court notice in the criminal case was sent, then, the postal endorsement at Exhibit P-5 is required to be treated as a false shara. In such an event, the complainant was expected to examine the author of the said postal acknowledgement, which he did not do; [b] A perusal of the Trial Court record would go to show that, the notice sent to the accused to the address showing the accused as the resident of Kumta was not served upon him personally, but it was served upon his brother at a different address, though in the same place, and through the Police. Added to this, DW-1 in his cross-examination has also stated that he came to know about the criminal case only through his mother, which further makes it clear that, the accused was not residing at his address in Kumta, at the relevant point of time, though his other family members might have been residing in the place called Kumta. By that itself, it cannot be said that the notice sent to the accused was served upon him when the postal shara has shown that, he has left the address and the document at Exhibit D-1 also shows that, he was working at Bengaluru at the relevant point of time. However both the Trial Court and the Session's Judge's Court, on their own, considered a surety affidavit shown to have been filed by the surety, who incidentally said to be the mother of the accused, wherein she is said to have produced a copy of the ration card, showing her address at Kumta. In the said ration card, one of the members of the family of that lady was shown to be the accused. Both the Trial Court and the Session's Judge's Court, on their own, accepting the same as the documentary proof, without there being any confrontation of the said document with DW-1, proceeded to hold that, the accused was residing at the address shown in the notice20. In view of the above analysis made, though the accused has produced cogent evidence to show that as on the date, he was not in the address at Kumta, but was residing at Bengaluru, and the postal article also shows that, he was not residing at Kumta, and had left the said place, it can be safely held that, the complainant could not able to prove that, there was valid service of notice upon the accused, after the dishonour of the cheque at Exhibit P-1.Though the said cheque at Ex.P-1 came to be dishonored for the reason of closure of the account and though the accused was the drawer of the said instrument, but in the absence of service of notice upon the accused, demanding the payment of the cheque amount, which is mandated under Section 138 of the N.I. Act, it cannot be held that, the complainant had fulfilled all the necessary ingredients of Section 138 of the N.I. Act.In the cross- examination of PW-1, it has been elicited that, the complainant was working as an artisan having income of a sum of '15,000/- per month and that he was not an income tax assessee. However, no suggestion was made to the witness suggesting that, financially, he was incapacitated to lend the money. In the absence of any specific suggestion made to the complainant, questioning his financial incapacity and when the complainant himself has stated that, he was earning a sum of '15,000/- per month, it cannot be inferred that, the complainant had no financial capacity to lend the alleged loan to the accused.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9845\n**Facts**: The present petitioner was accused in C.C.No.28343/2005, in the Court of the learned XII Addl.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, at Bengaluru City, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as `trial Court'). By its judgment dated 18.05.2011, the trial Court convicted the accused for the offence punishable under 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as `N.I.Act') and was sentenced accordingly. Aggrieved by the same, the accused preferred a Criminal Appeal in the Court of City Fast Track (Sessions) Judge, Bengaluru City, FTC-II, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the `Sessions Judge's Court') in Criminal Appeal No.417/2011. 2. The appeal was contested by the respondent who was the complainant in the trial Court. Aggrieved by the said judgment, the accused has preferred this revision petition. 3. The summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court is that on 15.01.2005, the accused borrowed from her a hand loan of a sum of `1 lakh in order to meet his family necessities. To discharge the liability, the accused executed an on demand Promissory Note and consideration receipt and also issued a cheque bearing No.670033, dated 8.7.2005, for a sum of `1 lakh, drawn on Canara Bank, SSB, Sanjayanagar Branch, Bengaluru, in favour of the complainant.  The accused had promised to repay the loan amount within six months. When the complainant presented the said cheque on 8.7.2005 for realisation through her Banker, the same came to be dishonoured with the Banker's endorsement `funds insufficient'. Thereafter, the complainant got issued a statutory notice upon the accused demanding the cheque amount, however, the accused failed to meet the demand. This constrained the complainant to institute a criminal case against the accused in the trial Court under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. 4. The accused appeared in the trial Court and contested the matter through his counsel. 5. To prove her case, the complainant got herself examined as PW-1 and another witness as PW-2 and got marked documents from Exs.P-1 to P-11. The accused got himself examined as DW-1 and two other witnesses as DW-2 and DW-3 and got marked documents from Exs.D-1 to D-3.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The Sessions Judge's Court by its order dated 28.12.2011, dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the trial Court dated 18.05.2011, in C.C.No.28343/2005.  The trial Court after recording the evidence led before it and hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 18.05.2011, convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of `1,10,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year.  Challenging the said judgment of conviction passed by the trial Court, the accused preferred an appeal in Criminal Appeal No.417/2011, before the learned Sessions Judge's Court, which, after hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 28.12.2011, dismissed the appeal filed by the accused, while confirming the impugned judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the trial Court. \n**Argument by Petitioner**: 11. Learned counsel for the revision petitioner/accused in his argument submitted that though the acquaintance between the parties, who were colleagues, and issuance of cheque at Ex.P-1 by the accused to the complainant duly signed by him and also the dishonor of the cheque when presented for realisation and further issuance of legal notice by the complainant to the accused, are all not in dispute, but, the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption formed in favour of the complainant under Section 139 of N.I.Act, as such, the burden of proving the loan was upon the complainant. Learned counsel further submitted that the complainant failed to discharge the said burden which both the trial Court and the Sessions Judge's Court did not notice. He further submitted that PW-2, the father of the complainant, not being the witness to the on demand Promissory Note and the trial Court not whispering anything with respect to Expert's opinion and harping much on earlier loan transaction for a sum of `50,000/-, had pronounced the judgment of conviction. 18. Learned counsel for the petitioner also raised a contention that PW-2, the father of the complainant, was not shown as witness to the on demand Promissory Note and consideration receipt at Exs.P-4 and P-5, as such also, the loan transaction becomes doubtful. \n**Argument by Respondent**: 12. Learned counsel for the respondent in his argument submitted that in spite of the complainant filing her statement of objections to the Expert's opinion, she was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the Expert. Further the Forensic Science Laboratory report also was not marked. With this, he submitted that the judgment of conviction under revision does not warrant any interference at the hands of this Court.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

The respondent herein is being represented by his counsel.\\n\\n7. The trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records were called for and the same are placed before this Court. Heard the arguments from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court, including the trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records. 9. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth referred to as per their rankings before the trial Court. 13. It is not in dispute that the complainant who got herself examined as PW-1 and the accused who got himself examined as DW-1 were acquainted with each other. It is also not in dispute that the cheque at Ex.P-1 was issued by the accused as a drawer in favour of the complainant and as could be seen in the Banker's endorsement at Ex.P-2, Debit Advise at Ex.P-3, the said cheque came to be dishonoured when presented for realisation by the complainant for the reason of insufficiency of funds.  It is also not in dispute that after dishonor of the cheque, the complainant got issued a legal notice as per Ex.P-6 to the accused demanding the cheque amount from him. These facts have come out in the evidence of PW-1, which have not been specifically denied from the accused side. Therefore, under Section 139 of N.I.Act, a presumption forms in favour of the complainant. Thus, the main point of argument of learned counsel for the accused was that the said presumption formed in favour of the complainant has been successfully rebutted by the accused. The accused has attempted to rebut the said presumption by taking a specific defence through his defence as DW-1 and also at the earliest point of time through his reply at Ex.D-1, which was sent to the complainant by him. Both in the said reply, as well in his defence evidence, the accused has taken a contention that in February 2004, the accused had availed a hand loan of a sum of `50,000/- from the complainant agreeing to repay the same with interest thereupon. It was at that time, the complainant had collected a blank cheque from the accused as a security towards the repayment of the loan amount. She had also obtained some blank papers duly signed by the accused. The same was reiterated by DW-1 in his examination-in-chief also. However, in his cross- examination, he has stated that he has not lodged any complaint against the complainant for the alleged misuse of the cheque said to have been given by him as a security. He also stated that he did not even sent any notice to her demanding return of the said cheque. Further, he has also not issued any stop-payment order to his Banker. He has also stated that he did not collect any acknowledgement or document from the complainant about he executing blank on demand Promissory Note and consideration receipt in favour of the complainant. He further admitted that DW-2 and DW-3, whom the accused examined as his witnesses, were not the witnesses in the said Promissory Note. 15. On the other hand, PW-1 and PW-2 in their evidence have specifically and categorically stated that the accused who was the colleague of PW-2, the father of the complainant, was introduced to the complainant by PW-2 and accordingly at the request of the accused and at the recommendation of her father (PW-2), the complainant lent the accused a sum of `1 lakh as hand loan. In the cross-examination of PW-1, though attempts were made to shaken the veracity of the statement made by the witness in her examination-in-chief, but, the accused could not succeed in it.  The denial suggestions made to the witness were not admitted as true by PW-1. Except making denial suggestions and eliciting some more details regarding the loan transaction, nothing could be elicited either in the cross-examination of PW-1 or in the cross- examination of PW-2 imbibing a doubt in the case of the complainant or introducing any element of suspicion in the contention of the complainant enabling the accused to rebut the presumption formed in favour of the complainant. 16. Had really the accused repaid the alleged earlier loan of `50,000/- and the cheque in question was required to be returned by the complainant to him immediately after the repayment of the alleged earlier loan, then, the accused should have necessarily taken some action against the complainant for non-returning of the said cheque. Admittedly, he has not taken any step in that regard and not even written any letter to her demanding return of the said cheque. At least, he could have issued a stop-payment direction to his Banker in order to avoid any possibility of misuse of the cheque, which also he has not done.  Therefore, as an ordinary prudent person, what he was expected to do in such a circumstance of the case, the accused has not done. As such, his mere contention in the form of his defence that the cheque in question was issued by him as a security towards the alleged previous loan transaction would not suffice to hold that the presumption formed in favour of the complainant under Section 139 of N.I.Act has stood successfully rebutted. 17. The accused has much relied upon the alleged Forensic Science Laboratory report. It is not in dispute that the said Forensic Science Laboratory examined Promissory Note, Consideration Receipt and the legal notice marked at Exs.P-4, P-5 and P-10 respectively in order to ascertain whether they have been generated from the same typewriter. It has given its opinion that all the three documents are found similar and generated from the same typewriter. Heavily relying upon the said Expert's opinion and taking the said Expert's opinion as a shield, learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently submitted that since the Promissory Note and Consideration Receipt are shown to have been typed by the same typewriter, it is highly doubtful whether the accused had executed the said Promissory Note and Consideration Receipt. Therefore, the issuance of the cheque for the same transaction also becomes doubtful. The said contention of the accused is not acceptable for the reason that : (i) Admittedly, the complainant in the trial Court had filed her statement of objections to the said Expert's opinion, however, she was not granted any opportunity to cross- examine the said Expert. (ii) There are no material or evidence to show that the accused had no access to the said typewriter in which Exs.P-4 and P-5 are said to have been typed. (iii) The author of the notice at Ex.P-10 was also not examined to elicit from him that Exs.P-4 and P-5 were also typewritten in the same typewriter in which Ex.P-10 was typed and that as on the date of filling up of Exs.P-4 and P-5 in the typewritten manner, the author of the document at Ex.P-10 had an access to the said typewriter. (iv) The examination report submitted by Forensic Science Laboratory no where gives any reason as to on what basis and after conducting which examinations or tests, it has arrived at such an opinion that all those three documents were generated from the same typewriter. (v) It cannot be ignored of the fact that the present case is not based upon the documents at Exs.P-4 and P-5, but, it is a case of alleged offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act, as such, the case is based upon dishonour of cheque at Ex.P-1, which admittedly was drawn by the accused in favour of the complainant. The said argument is also not acceptable for the reason that the accused has not shown any reason as to why PW-2 should have been made as a witness to the documents at Exs.P-4 and P-5. Merely because PW-2 is said to be the colleague of the accused and father of the complainant, by that itself, it cannot be taken that he should have been necessarily a witness to the Promissory Note and the consideration receipt. 19. Barring the above, the petitioner has not taken any other ground worth to be considered. Both the trial Court, as well the Sessions Judge's Court have arrived at the concurrent finding of holding the accused guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act after proper appreciation of the entire evidence and materials placed before them and in their proper perspective.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case revolves around the conviction of the accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act for issuing a dishonoured cheque and failing to honour the demand notice. The lower court found the accused guilty and sentenced him accordingly, based on the evidence of the complainant and the absence of any defence from the accused.\n\nUpon critical assessment, the key point to consider is the service of the legal notice on the accused after the dishonour of the cheque. The complainant has presented evidence of sending the legal notice through Registered Post Acknowledgement Due (RPAD) as well as under Certificate of Posting (UCP). Although the RPAD notice was returned with an endorsement, \"out of station - intimation delivered - left-address not known,\" the UCP notice was served upon the accused. This service is mandatory under Section 138 of the NI Act.\n\nThe complainant's financial capacity to lend the amount in question and the accused's alleged residence at Bengaluru during the relevant time are secondary points of argument. However, the complainant's evidence of payment of a significant sum to the accused in the past refutes the claim of financial incapacity.\n\nGiven the mandatory service of notice under Section 138 of the NI Act and the absence of any defence from the accused, the lower court's judgment appears correct. Therefore, the appeal should be dismissed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. The present petitioner as the accused was tried by the Court of the learned XXI Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"Trial Court\") in C.C.No.955/2012, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"N.I. Act\") and was convicted for the said offence by its judgment of conviction and order on sentence dated 27-06-2014. Aggrieved by the same, the accused preferred a Criminal Appeal in the Court of the LVIII Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge (CCH-59), Bengaluru City (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"Sessions Judge's Court\") in Criminal Appeal No.783/2014. The appeal was contested by the respondent who was the complainant in the Trial Court.  Aggrieved by the impugned judgments and order on sentence, the accused has preferred this revision petition. The summary of the case of the complainant in the Trial Court is that, the accused who was known to complainant approached him for a financial assistance for his domestic purpose and other financial problems on 01-07-2009. Accordingly, he (complainant) paid him a sum of `15,00,000/- on 01-07-2009, which loan amount the accused has agreed to repay together with interest at the rate of `2% within a short period. Towards the repayment of the loan, the accused issued a cheque for the principal amount of a sum of `15,00,000/- bearing No.129658, drawn on State Bank of Mysore, Hanumanthanagar, Bangalore - 560 019 and dated 03-11-2011 and drawn in favour of the complainant. The said cheque, when presented for realisation by the complainant, came to be dis-honoured and returned with the banker's shara \"payment stopped by drawer\". It is also further the case of the complainant that thereafter, he got issued a legal notice to the accused. Since the accused did not meet the demand made therein, the complainant was constrained to file a criminal case against him for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. . The accused appeared in the Trial Court and contested the matter through his counsel. He pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried, as such, the Trial Court proceeded to record the evidence wherein the complainant got himself examined as PW-1 and got marked documents from Exs.P-1 to P-14. From the accused's side, the accused himself got examined as DW-1 and got marked documents from Exs.D-1 to D-5. 12. The undisputed fact is that, the accused and the complainant were known to each other since a long time. It is also not in dispute that, the cheque at Exhibit P-1 is drawn by the accused and the same came to be dis-honoured with the reason of \"payment stopped by the drawer\" as evidenced in Exhibit P-2 which is a return memo of the cheque. However, the service of notice has not been admitted by the accused though the complainant says that such a notice was issued to the accused. Thus, it is in this aspect, the case on hand is now required to be analysed.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n10. Learned counsel for the revision petitioner/accused in his argument submitted that, there is mis-description of the alleged date of loan. In the complaint, the complainant has stated that, the date of loan is 01-07-2009 whereas in his legal notice, and in his cross-examination as PW-1, has given the date of loan as 13-07-2009.  He further submitted that the alleged loan was for a sum of `1,00,000/-. However, the cheque given to the complainant was misused by him by filling up the same for a sum of `15,00,000/- and thus, a false case has been filed against him 16. Secondly, the accused alleges that, the cheque at Exhibit P-1 was misused by the complainant. In that regard, the accused has taken a contention in the cross-examination of PW-1 that, he had availed a loan from one Sri. Jitendra Pal, wherein the complainant was a surety and at that time, he had given a blank cheque and a blank stamp paper to the complainant. PW-1 has not admitted the said suggestion as true. Therefore, the onus would be upon the accused to show that, the cheque was not intended to be given to the complainant as a beneficiary.  The said onus has not been discharged by the accused at least by creating some preponderance of probabilities for the reason that, nowhere, the accused, either in the cross- examination of PW-1 or in his evidence as DW-1, stated as to why he should give the cheque to the complainant, when the loan said to have been taken by him (accused) was from Sri.Jitendra Pal. Nowhere the accused has given any reason in that regard.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n. Learned counsel for the respondent/complainant in his argument submitted that, the petitioner could not able to show what is the perversity in the impugned judgments. He also stated that, the alleged discrepancy of the date of the loan is clarified by PW-1 in his cross- examination, which is not denied from the accused's side. The loan of `1,00,000/- is with respect to a different transaction which has got nothing to do with the transaction in question. He also says that Exhibits P-5 to P-8 prove the transaction. The evidence of PW-1 that, he made profit in the distribution of four Films would go to show that, he had financial capacity to lend the money. With respect to the service of notice upon the accused, the learned counsel for the respondent/ complainant submitted that, the accused himself has admitted that from the year 2009 onwards, he was residing in his father-in-law's house, as such, the notice sent to his father-in-law's house through courier since has not been returned, there is deemed service of notice upon him. He also submits that, both the Trial Court as well the learned Session's Judge's Court have observed that, the notice was served upon the accused. 4. According to the complainant, as contended by him in his legal notice alleged to have been issued to the accused, which is at Exhibit P-3, the accused approached him for a loan of a sum of `15,00,000/- on 01-07-2009 and the said amount was given to the accused by him on 13-07-2009.  On the other hand, the complainant both in his complaint as well in his evidence as st PW-1 has stated that, the date of the loan was 1 July 2009. However, PW-1 in his cross- examination has stated that, the loan was requested for by the accused on 01-07-2009 and the loan was actually given to the accused on 13-07-2009. Though there is discrepancy between the said alleged clarification and the complaint and also the statements made in the examination- in- chief of PW-1, but the clarification given by the complainant as PW-1 in his cross-examination has not further been denied or disputed from the accused's side. 15. According to the complainant, he had given the said sum of `15,00,000/- to the accused as a loan in cash. While denying the same, the accused attempted to elicit in the cross- examination of PW-1 that, the alleged loan was only for a sum of `1,00,000/-, in which regard, suggestions were made to PW-1 in his cross-examination. In the said cross-examination, the complainant has stated that, with respect to the distribution rights of the movie in Chitradurga and Bellari Districts, he had paid the accused a sum of `5,00,000/-, out of which, `1,00,000/- was through cheque and the remaining sum of `4,00,000/- was in the form of cash.  The said explanation having remained un- denied and un-disputed, would go to show that, the alleged loan transaction of a sum of `1,00,000/- as the defence taken by the accused was not with respect to the alleged loan transaction of a sum of `15,00,000/- for which the present complaint has been filed by the complainant, but that `5,00,000/- was with respect to the above transaction of distribution rights of a Kannada movie granted in favour of the accused by the complainant. Therefore, the said defence of the accused that the alleged loan transaction was only for a sum of `1,00,000/-, is not acceptable.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe Sessions Judge's Court in its order dated 28-05-2015 dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the Trial Court in C.C.No.955/2012.  The Trial Court after recording the evidence led before it, by its impugned judgment of conviction dated 27-06-2014 convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him to pay a total fine amount of `15,20,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for six months. Challenging the same, the accused preferred an appeal in Criminal Appeal No.783/2014 before the learned Session's Judge's Court, which after hearing both side, by its judgment dated 28-05-2015, dismissed the appeal, while confirming the judgment of conviction passed by the Trial Court. Being aggrieved by the same, the accused has preferred this revision petition.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Heard the arguments from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court including the Trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records.8. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth referred to as per their rankings before the Trial Court.13. The evidence of the parties would go to show that, the accused is a producer of a Kannada movie, by name, 'Devadas' and the complainant is also a producer-cum-distributor of the movies. It is not in dispute that, with respect to certain distribution rights about the said Kannada movie 'Devadas', there was business transaction between the complainant and the accused. According to the complainant, the distribution rights with respect to two Districts were given to him by the accused and with respect to the third District also, it was tentatively agreed by the accused, which statements made by the complainant as PW-1 has not been specifically denied or disputed by the accused's side. It is in this context, the contention of the complainant is that, it is towards the financial problem which the accused had in the production of the movie, 'Devadas', he had availed a loan of a sum of `15,00,000/- from him.However, it is noteworthy that, PW-1 in his examination-in-chief, has nowhere whispered about the production of the alleged movie, 'Devadas' by the accused or that the accused approaching him for any financial assistance with respect to the said film production by him. On the other hand, the details in that regard have been elicited in the cross-examination of PW-1 from the accused's side.17. Thirdly, the very same accused, in his cross- examination as DW-1 has stated that, he had given a blank cheque, a blank letter head and a blank stamp paper to the complainant on 01-07-2009. Added to these two different stands of the transfer of the cheque from the hands of the accused to the hands of the complainant, the accused as DW-1 in his very same cross- examination, at a later stage, has stated that, he had given the cheque at Exhibit P-1 to one Sri.Jitendra Pal, who had filed a case against his (accused's) father-in-law. Thus, about the transfer of the cheque from the hands of the accused to the hands of the complainant, three different versions have been given by the accused, none of which have been admitted by the complainant as true. As observed above, all these three defence taken up by the accused are contradictory to each other. Thus, the accused himself is not clear as to how the cheque in question which is at Ex.P-1 went to the hands of the complainant. Therefore, the evidence of the complainant that, the cheque was given to him by none else than the accused himself towards the repayment of the loan of a sum of `15,00,000/- taken by him, in which regard, a presumption under Section 118 of the N.I. Act also operating in his favour, crystalises the said presumption. Thus, it can be held that, the cheque at Exhibit P-1 was given by the accused to the complainant.8. Admittedly, the said cheque came to be returned dis- honoured when presented for realisation, as could be seen from the banker's endorsement at Exhibit P-2. The accused has not denied or disputed that the said cheque was returned with a shara \"payment stopped by the drawer\" when presented for realisation. However, the pivotal point is with regard to the service of notice upon the accused with respect to dishonour of the cheque and demanding the payment of the cheque amount by the complainant.19. With respect to issuance of notice to accused, PW-1 in his evidence has stated as follows:- \" I further submits that, I got issued the legal notice and sent to accused by registrar post acknowledgement due and also through courier service on 24-11-2011. the legal notice sent to the accused by with shara intimation delivered not claimed (ABSENT) dated 26.11.2011. the postal Receipts, marked as \"ANNEXURE-D, E and F\" for kind perusal of this Hon'ble court.\" By a reading of the aforesaid passage, which is reflected in the affidavit evidence filed by the complainant as PW-1 in the form of his examination-in-chief would take the Court nowhere. On the other hand, in his cross-examination, the very same witness, i.e. PW-1, in response to a suggestion made to him from the accused's side that, the notice alleged to have been sent by him has not been served upon him (accused), has denied the same. It was also suggested to PW-1 that, the notice sent to accused was returned with the postal shara \"incomplete address\", the witness replied stating that, at that time, the accused was residing in his father-in-law's house. He also stated that, he does not know whether the accused has received the notice or not. That means, PW-1 himself is not sure about the service of notice upon the accused. He himself has admitted that, the notice sent to the address of the accused was returned with the postal shara as \"incomplete address\" and though volunteered to say that the accused was residing in his father- in- law's house, but was not sure whether the notice was served upon him. Furthermore, the unreturned articles said to be containing the legal notices in them which are five in number have been marked as Exhibits P-6 and P-7. Exhibit P-6 is the address of the accused which address is claimed to have been vacated by him in the year 2006 as stated by him in his cross-examination as DW-1. It has been returned with a postal shara \"addressee left - not known\". The remaining four notices are marked together as Exhibit P-7 which includes the notices shown to have been sent through registered post as well as through courier to another alleged address of the accused, which, according to the complainant, is his father-in-law's address. Though, nowhere the complainant has stated that, the second address is the address of his father-in- law, however, since among the two addresses shown in the complaint, the first address being admittedly the address of the accused till 2006 and since the accused himself has stated as DW-1 that, from 2009 onwards, he was residing in his father-in-law's house, that other address (second address) was projected as his (accused's) father-in-law's address by the complainant as well as his learned counsel herein. Even if it is taken that, the address shown in the second address is \"C/o. Narsegowda, No.179, 4 th Cross, II Block, Gavipuram Extension, Alammaprabhu Road, Bengaluru - 560 019\", still, both the envelopes bearing the said address, one sent through registered post acknowledgment due and another shown to have been sent through courier have been returned un- served. Since the alleged envelope shown to have been sent through M/s. Professional Couriers (as could be seen through label) has been returned un-served and it is also part of Exhibit P-7, the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent herein that the notice sent through courier has not been returned is proved to be not correct. While the notice sent to the said address through registered post acknowledgement due (RPAD) has been returned with postal shara \"insufficient address', no shara for the return is visible on the courier article, which is also returned un-served. Therefore, the fact remains that, no notice has been served upon the accused. In the absence of any evidence on record to show that, such a notice was tendered to the accused or that the accused had the knowledge of such a notice, despite which he did not make good the cheque amount to the complainant, suffice it to say that, the demand for the payment of the returned cheque amount said to have been made by the complainant to the accused, did not reach the accused. Further no valid reasons are forthcoming to hold that, mere issuance of registered letter or courier letter itself can be treated as deemed serviceThis makes short of fulfillment of ingredients of Section 138 of the N.I. Act. This aspect both the Trial Court as well as the learned Session's Judge's Court did not approach in their proper perspective. This is the perversity which both the Courts have committed in appreciating the evidence merely by looking at the statement of accused (DW-1) that after 2009, he continued to stay in his father- in-law's house. Both the Courts presumed that the notice was served upon him, ignoring the fact that, all those notices sent to both the addresses have been returned un- served, some of them with specific postal shara, preventing the Court to hold that, even there is deemed service of notice upon the accused.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9845\n**Facts**: The present petitioner was accused in C.C.No.28343/2005, in the Court of the learned XII Addl.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, at Bengaluru City, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as `trial Court'). By its judgment dated 18.05.2011, the trial Court convicted the accused for the offence punishable under 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as `N.I.Act') and was sentenced accordingly. Aggrieved by the same, the accused preferred a Criminal Appeal in the Court of City Fast Track (Sessions) Judge, Bengaluru City, FTC-II, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the `Sessions Judge's Court') in Criminal Appeal No.417/2011. 2. The appeal was contested by the respondent who was the complainant in the trial Court. Aggrieved by the said judgment, the accused has preferred this revision petition. 3. The summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court is that on 15.01.2005, the accused borrowed from her a hand loan of a sum of `1 lakh in order to meet his family necessities. To discharge the liability, the accused executed an on demand Promissory Note and consideration receipt and also issued a cheque bearing No.670033, dated 8.7.2005, for a sum of `1 lakh, drawn on Canara Bank, SSB, Sanjayanagar Branch, Bengaluru, in favour of the complainant.  The accused had promised to repay the loan amount within six months. When the complainant presented the said cheque on 8.7.2005 for realisation through her Banker, the same came to be dishonoured with the Banker's endorsement `funds insufficient'. Thereafter, the complainant got issued a statutory notice upon the accused demanding the cheque amount, however, the accused failed to meet the demand. This constrained the complainant to institute a criminal case against the accused in the trial Court under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act. 4. The accused appeared in the trial Court and contested the matter through his counsel. 5. To prove her case, the complainant got herself examined as PW-1 and another witness as PW-2 and got marked documents from Exs.P-1 to P-11. The accused got himself examined as DW-1 and two other witnesses as DW-2 and DW-3 and got marked documents from Exs.D-1 to D-3.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: The Sessions Judge's Court by its order dated 28.12.2011, dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the trial Court dated 18.05.2011, in C.C.No.28343/2005.  The trial Court after recording the evidence led before it and hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 18.05.2011, convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of `1,10,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year.  Challenging the said judgment of conviction passed by the trial Court, the accused preferred an appeal in Criminal Appeal No.417/2011, before the learned Sessions Judge's Court, which, after hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 28.12.2011, dismissed the appeal filed by the accused, while confirming the impugned judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the trial Court. \n**Argument by Petitioner**: 11. Learned counsel for the revision petitioner/accused in his argument submitted that though the acquaintance between the parties, who were colleagues, and issuance of cheque at Ex.P-1 by the accused to the complainant duly signed by him and also the dishonor of the cheque when presented for realisation and further issuance of legal notice by the complainant to the accused, are all not in dispute, but, the accused has successfully rebutted the presumption formed in favour of the complainant under Section 139 of N.I.Act, as such, the burden of proving the loan was upon the complainant. Learned counsel further submitted that the complainant failed to discharge the said burden which both the trial Court and the Sessions Judge's Court did not notice. He further submitted that PW-2, the father of the complainant, not being the witness to the on demand Promissory Note and the trial Court not whispering anything with respect to Expert's opinion and harping much on earlier loan transaction for a sum of `50,000/-, had pronounced the judgment of conviction. 18. Learned counsel for the petitioner also raised a contention that PW-2, the father of the complainant, was not shown as witness to the on demand Promissory Note and consideration receipt at Exs.P-4 and P-5, as such also, the loan transaction becomes doubtful. \n**Argument by Respondent**: 12. Learned counsel for the respondent in his argument submitted that in spite of the complainant filing her statement of objections to the Expert's opinion, she was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the Expert. Further the Forensic Science Laboratory report also was not marked. With this, he submitted that the judgment of conviction under revision does not warrant any interference at the hands of this Court.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

The respondent herein is being represented by his counsel.\\n\\n7. The trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records were called for and the same are placed before this Court. Heard the arguments from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court, including the trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records. 9. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth referred to as per their rankings before the trial Court. 13. It is not in dispute that the complainant who got herself examined as PW-1 and the accused who got himself examined as DW-1 were acquainted with each other. It is also not in dispute that the cheque at Ex.P-1 was issued by the accused as a drawer in favour of the complainant and as could be seen in the Banker's endorsement at Ex.P-2, Debit Advise at Ex.P-3, the said cheque came to be dishonoured when presented for realisation by the complainant for the reason of insufficiency of funds.  It is also not in dispute that after dishonor of the cheque, the complainant got issued a legal notice as per Ex.P-6 to the accused demanding the cheque amount from him. These facts have come out in the evidence of PW-1, which have not been specifically denied from the accused side. Therefore, under Section 139 of N.I.Act, a presumption forms in favour of the complainant. Thus, the main point of argument of learned counsel for the accused was that the said presumption formed in favour of the complainant has been successfully rebutted by the accused. The accused has attempted to rebut the said presumption by taking a specific defence through his defence as DW-1 and also at the earliest point of time through his reply at Ex.D-1, which was sent to the complainant by him. Both in the said reply, as well in his defence evidence, the accused has taken a contention that in February 2004, the accused had availed a hand loan of a sum of `50,000/- from the complainant agreeing to repay the same with interest thereupon. It was at that time, the complainant had collected a blank cheque from the accused as a security towards the repayment of the loan amount. She had also obtained some blank papers duly signed by the accused. The same was reiterated by DW-1 in his examination-in-chief also. However, in his cross- examination, he has stated that he has not lodged any complaint against the complainant for the alleged misuse of the cheque said to have been given by him as a security. He also stated that he did not even sent any notice to her demanding return of the said cheque. Further, he has also not issued any stop-payment order to his Banker. He has also stated that he did not collect any acknowledgement or document from the complainant about he executing blank on demand Promissory Note and consideration receipt in favour of the complainant. He further admitted that DW-2 and DW-3, whom the accused examined as his witnesses, were not the witnesses in the said Promissory Note. 15. On the other hand, PW-1 and PW-2 in their evidence have specifically and categorically stated that the accused who was the colleague of PW-2, the father of the complainant, was introduced to the complainant by PW-2 and accordingly at the request of the accused and at the recommendation of her father (PW-2), the complainant lent the accused a sum of `1 lakh as hand loan. In the cross-examination of PW-1, though attempts were made to shaken the veracity of the statement made by the witness in her examination-in-chief, but, the accused could not succeed in it.  The denial suggestions made to the witness were not admitted as true by PW-1. Except making denial suggestions and eliciting some more details regarding the loan transaction, nothing could be elicited either in the cross-examination of PW-1 or in the cross- examination of PW-2 imbibing a doubt in the case of the complainant or introducing any element of suspicion in the contention of the complainant enabling the accused to rebut the presumption formed in favour of the complainant. 16. Had really the accused repaid the alleged earlier loan of `50,000/- and the cheque in question was required to be returned by the complainant to him immediately after the repayment of the alleged earlier loan, then, the accused should have necessarily taken some action against the complainant for non-returning of the said cheque. Admittedly, he has not taken any step in that regard and not even written any letter to her demanding return of the said cheque. At least, he could have issued a stop-payment direction to his Banker in order to avoid any possibility of misuse of the cheque, which also he has not done.  Therefore, as an ordinary prudent person, what he was expected to do in such a circumstance of the case, the accused has not done. As such, his mere contention in the form of his defence that the cheque in question was issued by him as a security towards the alleged previous loan transaction would not suffice to hold that the presumption formed in favour of the complainant under Section 139 of N.I.Act has stood successfully rebutted. 17. The accused has much relied upon the alleged Forensic Science Laboratory report. It is not in dispute that the said Forensic Science Laboratory examined Promissory Note, Consideration Receipt and the legal notice marked at Exs.P-4, P-5 and P-10 respectively in order to ascertain whether they have been generated from the same typewriter. It has given its opinion that all the three documents are found similar and generated from the same typewriter. Heavily relying upon the said Expert's opinion and taking the said Expert's opinion as a shield, learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently submitted that since the Promissory Note and Consideration Receipt are shown to have been typed by the same typewriter, it is highly doubtful whether the accused had executed the said Promissory Note and Consideration Receipt. Therefore, the issuance of the cheque for the same transaction also becomes doubtful. The said contention of the accused is not acceptable for the reason that : (i) Admittedly, the complainant in the trial Court had filed her statement of objections to the said Expert's opinion, however, she was not granted any opportunity to cross- examine the said Expert. (ii) There are no material or evidence to show that the accused had no access to the said typewriter in which Exs.P-4 and P-5 are said to have been typed. (iii) The author of the notice at Ex.P-10 was also not examined to elicit from him that Exs.P-4 and P-5 were also typewritten in the same typewriter in which Ex.P-10 was typed and that as on the date of filling up of Exs.P-4 and P-5 in the typewritten manner, the author of the document at Ex.P-10 had an access to the said typewriter. (iv) The examination report submitted by Forensic Science Laboratory no where gives any reason as to on what basis and after conducting which examinations or tests, it has arrived at such an opinion that all those three documents were generated from the same typewriter. (v) It cannot be ignored of the fact that the present case is not based upon the documents at Exs.P-4 and P-5, but, it is a case of alleged offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act, as such, the case is based upon dishonour of cheque at Ex.P-1, which admittedly was drawn by the accused in favour of the complainant. The said argument is also not acceptable for the reason that the accused has not shown any reason as to why PW-2 should have been made as a witness to the documents at Exs.P-4 and P-5. Merely because PW-2 is said to be the colleague of the accused and father of the complainant, by that itself, it cannot be taken that he should have been necessarily a witness to the Promissory Note and the consideration receipt. 19. Barring the above, the petitioner has not taken any other ground worth to be considered. Both the trial Court, as well the Sessions Judge's Court have arrived at the concurrent finding of holding the accused guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act after proper appreciation of the entire evidence and materials placed before them and in their proper perspective.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "DISMISSED\n\nThe core issue of the case is whether the accused is liable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act for issuing a dishonoured cheque to the complainant for a loan amount of `15,00,000/-, despite a legal notice issued by the complainant. The lower court's judgment is based on the complainant's statement that the loan amount was `15,00,000/- and the cheque issued was for the same amount. The lower court found discrepancies in the dates of the loan and the cheque, but the complainant's clarification in cross-examination was not further denied or disputed by the accused.\n\nThe lower court also noted that the accused's defence of the loan amount being only `1,00,000/- was not supported by the evidence, as the cheque issued was for `15,00,000/- and the complainant's explanation regarding the distribution rights of a movie was for `5,00,000/- and not the `1,00,000/- claimed by the accused.\n\nGiven this analysis, the lower court's judgment appears logical and well-reasoned. The arguments and evidence presented by both parties support the initial ruling. Therefore, the appeal should be dismissed."

Learned counsel further submitted that the complainant failed to discharge the said burden which both the trial Court and the Sessions Judge's Court did not notice. He further submitted that PW-2, the father of the complainant, not being the witness to the on demand Promissory Note and the trial Court not whispering anything with respect to Expert's opinion and harping much on earlier loan transaction for a sum of `50,000/-, had pronounced the judgment of conviction. 18. Learned counsel for the petitioner also raised a contention that PW-2, the father of the complainant, was not shown as witness to the on demand Promissory Note and consideration receipt at Exs.P-4 and P-5, as such also, the loan transaction becomes doubtful. \nArgument by the Respondent:\n12. Learned counsel for the respondent in his argument submitted that in spite of the complainant filing her statement of objections to the Expert's opinion, she was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the Expert. Further the Forensic Science Laboratory report also was not marked. With this, he submitted that the judgment of conviction under revision does not warrant any interference at the hands of this Court.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe Sessions Judge's Court by its order dated 28.12.2011, dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the trial Court dated 18.05.2011, in C.C.No.28343/2005.  The trial Court after recording the evidence led before it and hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 18.05.2011, convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of `1,10,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year.  Challenging the said judgment of conviction passed by the trial Court, the accused preferred an appeal in Criminal Appeal No.417/2011, before the learned Sessions Judge's Court, which, after hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 28.12.2011, dismissed the appeal filed by the accused, while confirming the impugned judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the trial Court. \n",
    "Case_Result": "Being aggrieved by the judgments of conviction and order on sentence, the accused has preferred this revision petition.The respondent herein is being represented by his counsel.\n\n7. The trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records were called for and the same are placed before this Court.Heard the arguments from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court, including the trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records.9. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth referred to as per their rankings before the trial Court.13. It is not in dispute that the complainant who got herself examined as PW-1 and the accused who got himself examined as DW-1 were acquainted with each other. It is also not in dispute that the cheque at Ex.P-1 was issued by the accused as a drawer in favour of the complainant and as could be seen in the Banker's endorsement at Ex.P-2, Debit Advise at Ex.P-3, the said cheque came to be dishonoured when presented for realisation by the complainant for the reason of insufficiency of funds. It is also not in dispute that after dishonor of the cheque, the complainant got issued a legal notice as per Ex.P-6 to the accused demanding the cheque amount from him. These facts have come out in the evidence of PW-1, which have not been specifically denied from the accused side. Therefore, under Section 139 of N.I.Act, a presumption forms in favour of the complainant. Thus, the main point of argument of learned counsel for the accused was that the said presumption formed in favour of the complainant has been successfully rebutted by the accused.The accused has attempted to rebut the said presumption by taking a specific defence through his defence as DW-1 and also at the earliest point of time through his reply at Ex.D-1, which was sent to the complainant by him. Both in the said reply, as well in his defence evidence, the accused has taken a contention that in February 2004, the accused had availed a hand loan of a sum of `50,000/- from the complainant agreeing to repay the same with interest thereupon. It was at that time, the complainant had collected a blank cheque from the accused as a security towards the repayment of the loan amount. She had also obtained some blank papers duly signed by the accused. The same was reiterated by DW-1 in his examination-in-chief also.However, in his cross- examination, he has stated that he has not lodged any complaint against the complainant for the alleged misuse of the cheque said to have been given by him as a security. He also stated that he did not even sent any notice to her demanding return of the said cheque. Further, he has also not issued any stop-payment order to his Banker. He has also stated that he did not collect any acknowledgement or document from the complainant about he executing blank on demand Promissory Note and consideration receipt in favour of the complainant. He further admitted that DW-2 and DW-3, whom the accused examined as his witnesses, were not the witnesses in the said Promissory Note.15. On the other hand, PW-1 and PW-2 in their evidence have specifically and categorically stated that the accused who was the colleague of PW-2, the father of the complainant, was introduced to the complainant by PW-2 and accordingly at the request of the accused and at the recommendation of her father (PW-2), the complainant lent the accused a sum of `1 lakh as hand loan. In the cross-examination of PW-1, though attempts were made to shaken the veracity of the statement made by the witness in her examination-in-chief, but, the accused could not succeed in it. The denial suggestions made to the witness were not admitted as true by PW-1. Except making denial suggestions and eliciting some more details regarding the loan transaction, nothing could be elicited either in the cross-examination of PW-1 or in the cross- examination of PW-2 imbibing a doubt in the case of the complainant or introducing any element of suspicion in the contention of the complainant enabling the accused to rebut the presumption formed in favour of the complainant.16. Had really the accused repaid the alleged earlier loan of `50,000/- and the cheque in question was required to be returned by the complainant to him immediately after the repayment of the alleged earlier loan, then, the accused should have necessarily taken some action against the complainant for non-returning of the said cheque. Admittedly, he has not taken any step in that regard and not even written any letter to her demanding return of the said cheque. At least, he could have issued a stop-payment direction to his Banker in order to avoid any possibility of misuse of the cheque, which also he has not done. Therefore, as an ordinary prudent person, what he was expected to do in such a circumstance of the case, the accused has not done. As such, his mere contention in the form of his defence that the cheque in question was issued by him as a security towards the alleged previous loan transaction would not suffice to hold that the presumption formed in favour of the complainant under Section 139 of N.I.Act has stood successfully rebutted.17. The accused has much relied upon the alleged Forensic Science Laboratory report. It is not in dispute that the said Forensic Science Laboratory examined Promissory Note, Consideration Receipt and the legal notice marked at Exs.P-4, P-5 and P-10 respectively in order to ascertain whether they have been generated from the same typewriter. It has given its opinion that all the three documents are found similar and generated from the same typewriter. Heavily relying upon the said Expert's opinion and taking the said Expert's opinion as a shield, learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently submitted that since the Promissory Note and Consideration Receipt are shown to have been typed by the same typewriter, it is highly doubtful whether the accused had executed the said Promissory Note and Consideration Receipt.Therefore, the issuance of the cheque for the same transaction also becomes doubtful. The said contention of the accused is not acceptable for the reason that : (i) Admittedly, the complainant in the trial Court had filed her statement of objections to the said Expert's opinion, however, she was not granted any opportunity to cross- examine the said Expert. (ii) There are no material or evidence to show that the accused had no access to the said typewriter in which Exs.P-4 and P-5 are said to have been typed. (iii) The author of the notice at Ex.P-10 was also not examined to elicit from him that Exs.P-4 and P-5 were also typewritten in the same typewriter in which Ex.P-10 was typed and that as on the date of filling up of Exs.P-4 and P-5 in the typewritten manner, the author of the document at Ex.P-10 had an access to the said typewriter. (iv) The examination report submitted by Forensic Science Laboratory no where gives any reason as to on what basis and after conducting which examinations or tests, it has arrived at such an opinion that all those three documents were generated from the same typewriter. (v) It cannot be ignored of the fact that the present case is not based upon the documents at Exs.P-4 and P-5, but, it is a case of alleged offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act, as such, the case is based upon dishonour of cheque at Ex.P-1, which admittedly was drawn by the accused in favour of the complainant.The said argument is also not acceptable for the reason that the accused has not shown any reason as to why PW-2 should have been made as a witness to the documents at Exs.P-4 and P-5. Merely because PW-2 is said to be the colleague of the accused and father of the complainant, by that itself, it cannot be taken that he should have been necessarily a witness to the Promissory Note and the consideration receipt.19. Barring the above, the petitioner has not taken any other ground worth to be considered. Both the trial Court, as well the Sessions Judge's Court have arrived at the concurrent finding of holding the accused guilty of the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act after proper appreciation of the entire evidence and materials placed before them and in their proper perspective.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e986b\n**Facts**:  Aggrieved by the same, the accused preferred a Criminal Appeal in the Court of the City Fast Track (Sessions) Judge, Bangalore City (F.T.C.No.VII) (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"Sessions Judge's Court\") in Criminal Appeal No.463/2011. The appeal was contested by the respondent who was the complainant in the Trial Court.  Aggrieved by the said order, the accused has preferred this revision petition. 2. The summary of the case of the complainant in the Trial Court is that, the accused was known to him and in the month of October 2007, he approached him for a hand loan of a sum of `50,000/- for his financial necessity. Acceding to the request of the accused, the complainant lent him a sum of `50,000/- in October 2007 as a loan which was repayable within a period of six months from the said date. Towards the repayment of the said loan amount, the accused issued a cheque bearing No.435018 for a sum of `50,000/- drawn in favour of the complainant, on Canara Bank, Byatarayanapura Branch, Bengaluru-560026. When the said cheque was presented for its realisation, the same came to be dis-honoured with the banker's endorsement 'funds insufficient'.  Thereafter, the complainant got issued a legal notice to the accused demanding the cheque amount. The accused even after receipt of the notice, failed to meet the demand made in the notice, which constrained the complainant to institute a criminal case against the accused in the Trial Court for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. 3. The accused appeared through his counsel and contested the matter.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: . The present petitioner as the accused was tried by the Court of the learned XIII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"Trial Court\"), in C.C.No.17396/2008 for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as the \"N.I. Act\") and was convicted for the said offence by its judgment of conviction and order on sentence dated 06-06-2011 The Sessions Judge's Court in its order dated 14-12-2011 dismissed the appeal, confirming the judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the Trial Court dated 06-06-2011 in C.C.No.17396/2008.  5. The Trial Court after recording the evidence led before it and hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 06-06-2011 convicted the accused for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the N.I. Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of `55,000/-, in default, to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year.  Challenging the said judgment of conviction passed by the Trial Court, the accused preferred an appeal in Criminal Appeal No.463/2011 before the learned Sessions Judge's Court, which after hearing both side, by its impugned judgment dated 14-12-2011 dismissed the appeal filed by the accused, while confirming the impugned judgment of conviction and order on sentence passed by the Trial Court. \n**Argument by Petitioner**: 11. Learned counsel for the petitioner in his arguments submitted that the Trial Court has ignored the defence taken up by the accused. It also ignored the fact that the notice demanding the dis- honoured cheque amount was not served upon the accused. Further, there was no motive for the alleged loan. In such a situation, the Trial Court as well as the learned Session's Judge's Court ought not to have held the accused/petitioner guilty for the alleged offence.\n**Argument by Respondent**: 12. Learned Amicus Curiae for the respondent in his argument submitted that the complainant by leading both oral and documentary evidence has proved that the accused had issued the cheque in question at Ex.P-1 towards repayment of the loan availed by him in October 2007. Admittedly, the said cheque came to be dis-honoured when presented for its realisation. It is also not in dispute that the accused did not meet the demand made in the legal notice. As such, a presumption in favour of the complainant had been formed under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. However, the accused failed to rebut the said presumption. He further submitted that since both the Trial Court and the Sessions Judge's Court, have after proper appreciation of the evidence, convicted the accused, the same does not warrant any interference at the hands of this Court. However, the contention of the accused was that, the legal notice said to have been sent by the complainant after dishonour of the said cheque at Ex.P-1 has not reached him at any point of time.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

To prove his case, the complainant got himself examined as PW-1 and got marked documents from Exs.P-1 to P-6. The accused got himself examined as DW-1 and also got examined one Mrs. Geetha as DW-2 and got marked Bank Pass book as the sole document at Ex.D-1. Being aggrieved by the judgments of conviction and order on sentence, the accused has preferred this revision petition. 6. In view of the fact that the learned counsel for the respondent failed to appear before this Court on several dates of hearing and also considering the fact that this revision petition is nearly ten years' old, this Court by its order dated 25-01-2021, appointed learned counsel Sri. S. Javeed, as Amicus Curiae for the respondent to defend his case. 7. The Trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records were called for and the same are placed before this Court. 8. Heard the arguments from both side. Perused the materials placed before this Court including the Trial Court and Sessions Judge's Court's records 9. For the sake of convenience, the parties would be henceforth referred to as per their rankings before the Trial Court. 13. The acquaintance between the complainant and the accused is not in dispute. Even the accused also admitted that the complainant was acquainted with him, but his defence was that the alleged loan amount was only a sum of `10,000/- but not a sum of `50,000/-. Further, it is also not in dispute that the accused is the drawer of the cheque at Ex.P-1 which came to be dis-honoured when presented for its realisation by the complainant with the postal shara 'funds insufficient'. However, the defence of the accused in this regard is that the said cheque was given to the complainant as a security towards a loan of a sum of `10,000/- availed by him in February 2007. 14. The complainant as PW-1 in his Examination-in-chief in the form of affidavit evidence has reiterated the contentions taken up by him in his complaint. He has stated that it is towards the repayment of the loan the accused had issued cheque at Ex.P-1 which came to be dis-honoured when presented for its realisation. He has produced the banker's endorsement at Ex.P-2. Stating that, demanding the cheque amount, he had issued a legal notice to the accused, the witness got marked a copy of the legal notice at Ex.P-3. 15. The accused has not denied that he is the drawer for the instrument at Ex.P-1. He has also not denied or disputed that the said cheque at Ex.P-1 came to be dis-honoured when presented for its realisation by the complainant, as evidenced in the banker's endorsement at Ex.P-2. It is also not denied that the reason for the dishonour of the cheque was insufficiency of funds in his account.  On the other hand, the evidence of PW-1 is that, apart from sending the said legal notice at Ex.P-3 through Registered Post Acknowledgement Due (RPAD) as evidenced in the postal receipt at Ex.P-4, he had also sent a copy of the said notice Under Certificate of Posting (UCP) as evidenced in Ex.P-5. However, admittedly, the said notice sent under Registered Post Acknowledgement Due (RPAD) has been returned to the sender as evidenced in the returned postal cover at Ex.P-6 with the postal endorsement \"not claimed'. 16. A perusal of the returned postal article at Ex.P-6 goes to show that, the postman has attempted to deliver the said postal article for more than two days to the accused and since he noticed that the door of the residence of the accused was locked, he had left an intimation also. An endorsement is there to that effect in the postal article that the intimation was delivered on 15-04-2008.  Thus, when the legal notice was sent by the complainant to the correct address of the accused and the postal authority attempted to deliver the said article to the accused and since the postal authorities also have left an intimation regarding the arrival of the postal article to the accused, it is deemed that the accused is served of the legal notice by the complainant. In addition to the above, the contention of the complainant that, the copy of the very same notice was also sent to the accused Under Certificate of Posting (UCP) as per Ex.P-5 and the said article has been duly served upon the accused, has not been specifically denied or disputed from the accused's side. On the contrary, in the cross-examination of DW-1, the accused himself has voluntarily stated that immediately after receipt of the notice, he came to know the details in it and approached the complainant to pay the balance amount, however, he refused to accept the same. By stating so, DW-1 has made it clear that, he was in receipt of the legal notice sent to him by the complainant.  Therefore, the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that, the said voluntary statement of DW-1 in his cross- examination must be taken as acknowledgment about the receipt of the summons but not the legal notice, as such, there is no proof of service of legal notice upon the accused, is not acceptable. 17. Regarding the possession of the cheque at Ex.P-1 with the complainant is concerned, the only defence of the accused was that, he had availed a hand loan of a sum of `10,000/- from the complainant in February 2007 in the presence of one Smt. Geetha and at that time, as a security for the said loan, he had delivered the cheque at Ex.P-1 duly signed by him, however, the complainant has misused the very same cheque which has led to the present case. 8. Except making the said statement, the accused has not produced any documentary proof to corroborate his contention. However, he got examined one Smt. Geetha in his support, who has stated that, it was in her presence, the complainant had given the accused a hand loan of a sum of `10,000/- in February 2007 and it was at that point of time, the complainant had collected a blank cheque from the accused which has now been misused by him by presenting it in the Court for a sum of `50,000/-.   Denial suggestions were made to the said witness in her cross- examination, however, she has not admitted the same as true. 19. In order to ascertain whether the said evidence of DW-2 inspires any confidence to believe in it, the evidence placed before the Trial Court from both side has to be glanced with respect to the alleged oral evidence of DW-2. In the cross-examination of PW-1, it was attempted to elicit from the witness that he knows DW-2 - Smt. Geetha and it was in her presence the loan of a sum of `10,000/- was given to the accused in February 2007.  However, PW-1 categorically stated that he does not know said Smt. Geetha. Furthermore, the witness has also stated that except the general public, there were none in the vicinity when he delivered the loan in question which is a sum of `50,000/- to the accused in October 2007. Therefore, when PW-1 has stated that DW-2 was a stranger to him and also at the earliest point of time in his evidence as PW-1 made it clear that, there was none present at the time of giving the loan except the general public, it is difficult to believe that DW-2 was present at the time of the alleged transaction said to have taken place in February 2007. 20. In this regard, the non-mentioning of the alleged cheque number said to have been given by the accused to the complainant as a security in February 2007, by DW-2 in her evidence also introduces a suspicion in believing her evidence. Had she really present at the time of the alleged loan transaction in February 2007 and witnessed the alleged delivery of the cheque at Ex.P-1 to the complainant as a security, then, she could also have mentioned the details of the cheque including its serial number, drawee branch details and the cheque amount details etc. But none of these details have been elicited in her evidence. Therefore, merely because DW-2 appears and says that she was a witness to the alleged loan transaction in February 2007, by that itself, it cannot be inferred that no loan transaction had taken place between the complainant and the accused in October 2007.  Therefore, the accused though had taken a defence that the cheque in question was issued as a security to the complainant, could not able to substantiate his contention. Thus, he has failed to rebut the presumption that was formed in favour of the complainant. 1. Both Trial Court as well as the Sessions Judge's Court have rightly appreciated this aspect and thus have come to a conclusion that the complainant had proved the alleged guilt against the accused. In the said finding of the Trial Court, which was further confirmed by the learned Sessions Judge's Court, I do not find any perversity, illegality or irregularity, warranting interference at the hands of this Court. 22. It also cannot be ignored at this stage that admittedly, the accused has not taken any steps to recover the alleged cheque at Ex.P-1, said to have been issued by him to the complainant as a security and no stop payment instruction was admittedly given by him to his banker to stop the payment of the cheque in question.  This inaction on the part of the accused also further strengthens the presumption that has been formed in favour of the complainant. In this background, I do not find any reason to hold that the Trial Court and the Sessions Judge's Court have erred anywhere in holding the accused guilty for the alleged offence.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case is whether the accused is guilty under Section 138 of the N.I. Act for dishonoring a cheque issued to the complainant for repayment of a loan. The lower court found the accused guilty and sentenced him accordingly.\n\nIn assessing the lower court's judgment, it appears that the court did not consider the rebuttal of the presumption of dishonor of the cheque by the accused. The accused's evidence has not been sufficiently examined, and the loan transaction's doubtfulness due to PW-2 not being shown as a witness to the on demand Promissory Note and consideration receipt remains unaddressed.\n\nConsidering these gaps in the lower court's reasoning, the appeal should be allowed. The lower court's decision is not based on a thorough application of the law, and the evidence presented does not support the initial ruling."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nThe petitioner was the accused in the Court of learned V Judicial Magistrate First Class, Mangaluru (hereinafter referred to as 'the Trial Court) in C.C. No.2482/2005 who was tried for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for brevity, hereinafter referred to as 'the N.I. Act'). The summary of the case of the complainant in the Trial Court is that the accused who was known to him had availed a loan of `1,50,000/- from him in two instalments in the months of November and December, 2004. After repeated demand for the repayment of the loan, the accused issued a cheque bearing No.0180571 drawn on S.C.D.C.C. Bank Ltd., Kodialbail at Mangaluru dated 01.06.2005 and for a sum of `1,50,000/- in his favour. However, when the said cheque was presented for realisation, the same came to be returned with a banker's endorsement as \"account closed\". Thereafter he (complainant) issued a legal notice demanding the cheque amount. The accused refused to receive the legal notice and also did not pay the cheque amount which constrained the complainant to institute a criminal case against him.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned amicus curiae for the petitioner in her arguments vehemently submitted that the complainant had no financial capacity to lend the money. The complainant who was working in an electric shop on a monthly salary of `7,000/- cannot be imagined to lend a sum of `1,50,000/- as loan to the accused.  She further submitted that the accused as D.W.1 had led his evidence showing that the blank cheque kept by the accused in his office drawer was stolen by the complainant. With this she submitted that the presumption formed in favour of the complainant has been successfully rebutted by the accused, but, on the other hand, the complainant has not proved the existence of a legally enforceable debt, as such, the impugned Judgment is required to be set aside.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nPer contra, learned counsel for the respondent in his arguments submitted that the defence taken up by the accused is not at all established. There is nothing to show that he had left a cheque in question in his drawer.  In that regard the accused has not examined any of his employees to corroborate his contention. Admittedly the accused has not intimated his banker about the theft of the cheque. No complaint regarding theft of the cheque has admittedly been filed by the accused, as such, the alleged defence is admittedly an after-thought of the accused.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe trial was held wherein the complainant himself got examined as P.W.1 and got marked exhibits from P1 to P4. The accused got himself examined as D.W.1 and got marked a document at Ex.D1.  After hearing both side the Trial Court by its impugned Judgment dated 12.12.2007 convicted the accused for the alleged offence and sentenced him accordingly.  The same was confirmed in Crl. Appeal No.20/2008 instituted by the accused in the impugned Judgment of the learned III Addl. District and Sessions Judge, D.K., Mangaluru (for brevity, 'Sessions Judge's Court) which is dated 02.03.2019.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Aggrieved by the same, the accused has preferred this revision petition. Considering the fact that since for a long time, there was no representation for the petitioner, this Court by its detailed Order dated 28.01.2021 appointed an amicus curiae for the petitioner. Accordingly, learned amicus curiae is before the Court today.The Sessions Court and the Trial Court records were called for and the same are placed before the Court. Perused the materials placed on record. Heard arguments of the learned amicus curiae for the revision petitioner as well as the learned counsel for the respondent who are physically present in the Court.9. It is an admitted fact that the complainant and accused were known to each other. In that regard both the complainant and the accused have deposed in their respective evidence stating that they knew each other. Further admittedly the accused has admitted that the cheque at Ex.P1 pertain to his account and he has not denied that the said cheque came to be dishonoured for the reason of \"account closed\" when presented for realisation by the complainant. The said cheque is at Ex.P1 and the banker's endorsement showing the reason for dishonour of the cheque is at Ex.P2. The complainant who got himself examined as P.W.1 has also produced a copy of the legal notice said to have been sent to the accused at Ex.P3 and as a matter of fact, the returned 'registered post acknowledgement due' envelop is at Ex.P4 and the legal notice in it is marked at Ex.P4(a). According to P.W.1, the accused refused to receive the said notice. In that regard in the cross examination of D.W.1, it was elicited that the address shown in the notice and the RPAD cover and also in the complaint filed before the Trial Court are one and same and correct address. In the said background when admittedly the accused is the drawer of the cheque at Ex.P1 and the same came to be dishonoured when presented for realisation and thereafter a legal notice was issued demanding the cheque amount, a presumption about the existence of legally enforceable debt forms in favour of the complainant under Section 139 of the N.I. Act. However, the said presumption is rebuttable.10. According to the amicus curiae for the petitioner, the accused has successfully rebutted the said presumption not only by cross examination of P.W.1 but also by entering himself into witness box as D.W.1 and leading evidence. In that regard the only contention taken up by the accused is about the alleged financial unsoundness of the complainant.11. In order to show that the complainant was financially incapable for lending so much of amount as loan, the accused subjected P.W.1 to a detailed cross examination. He elicited from the complainant that he was working in a shop by name M/s. Datta Electricals and was drawing a monthly salary of `7,000/-. It is based on the said statement made by P.W.1 in his cross examination, learned amicus curiae vehemently contended that a person having a monthly salary of `7,000/- cannot be expected to lend a sum of `1,50,000/-.12. A reading of the evidence of P.W.1 would further go to show that the complainant as P.W.1 has stated that he was working in M/s. Datta Electricals from 1977 to 1997 as an employee. However, from the year 1997, the said shop was given to him and he is running the said shop though the licence of the said shop is in the name of one Sri. A.S. Devadatta. The said statement made by P.W.1 has not been specifically denied in his cross examination. Furthermore the very same witness has in his cross examination also stated that he was maintaining his personal account in Karnataka Bank at its Balmatta Branch from which bank account, in the year 2004, during November, he had drawn a cash of `1,00,000/- and lent it to the accused. Subsequently in the month of December, he has withdrawn a sum of `20,000/- and another sum of `30,000/- from the bank and lent it to the accused. When specifically asked to the complainant as to whether he had any difficulty in lending the loan in the form of cheque, the witness has answered stating that since accused demanded the loan amount in cash he had lent the amount in cash.These statements made by the complainant in his evidence has not been specifically and categorically denied in his cross examination. Therefore, when the complainant has stated that he has been de facto proprietor of the electrical shop in which he was earlier working for a couple of decades and when his further say that he has withdrawn the amount from the bank and lent it, being undenied statements, would clearly go to show that the complainant had financial capacity to lend the money. The accused in order to rebut the presumption, by taking a contention that the complainant had no financial capacity to lend, could have examined any witness on his behalf and more particularly, the alleged erstwhile proprietor of M/s. Datta Electricals by name Sri. Devaduta which attempt also the accused has not done. In that regard in the cross examination of D.W.1, certain statements were elicited where the accused specifically stated that he did not approach said Mr. Devadatta and ascertain whether the complainant is a mere employee of the shop or he is running the shop by himself. Further D.W.1 in the very same cross examination has also stated that he does not know the business turnover of the said shop and the tax that is being paid by the said shop. He also has stated that he does not know as to the income tax that would be received from the said shop. Therefore, the contention taken up by the accused about the alleged financial incapacity of the complainant is a mere statement and the accused has not made any smallest attempt to substantiate his contention. Thus when a mere contention is taken without even providing any corroborative evidence either orally or documentary to make that contention as a genuine contention and showing some preponderance of probability in the said contention, it cannot be held that the accused could able to show that complainant had no financial capacity to lend the money.13. On the other hand, the accused has taken a specific defence both in the cross examination of P.W.1 as well in his evidence as D.W.1 that the complainant after completion of his business in the shop, used to come and sit in his courier shop and on one such occasion he had stolen the cheque in question which was a blank but duly signed cheque kept by him (accused) in his office drawer with a direction to his employees to deliver it to the landlord towards the rent. Suggestion made to P.W.1 in his cross examination to that extent has been denied by P.W.1.Therefore, it was for the accused to show that the cheque in question has wrongly reached the complainant though he was not entitled for the same.14. In that direction, the accused as D.W.1 in his examination-in-chief reiterated that the cheque which was meant for payment of rent was stolen by the complainant. In this regard what could be noticed is: Firstly the accused has taken a contention that he had kept a blank but duly signed cheque in the drawer of his office as a payment towards the rent payable to the landlord. If it were to be so, when rent would be generally predetermined or agreed to between the parties, where was the necessity for the accused to leave a blank cheque but duly signed is nowhere answered by the accused.Secondly, though the accused has asserted that the complainant after completion of his business in the shop used to go and sit in his courier shop in the evening, but nothing is placed on record to show that the complainant used to visit his shop everyday evening. On the other hand, the accused as D.W.1 himself has stated that he does not know as to at what time the shop of the complainant used to be closed everyday. Therefore, it is hard to believe that the complainant after closure of his business used to go and sit in the courier shop of the accused that too for no reasons. Thirdly, D.W.1 in his examination-in-chief has stated that he had kept the cheque in question as a blank cheque but duly signed in the drawer in his office with a direction to his employees who according to him were five in number, to deliver it to the landlord towards the payment of the rent.On the other hand, in his cross examination, the very same witness has stated that he had handed over the said cheque into the hands of one Smt. Vanitha, an employee in his shop. Therefore, in the very same evidence, the witness has given a contradictory statement about the alleged placing of the cheque in his shop. Fourthly, the accused has stated in his cross examination that with respect to the shop business and transaction, he is maintaining account books and makes necessary entries in those books. However, in an answer to another question he has stated that he has not mentioned about the alleged cheque said to have been earmarked towards the payment of the rent, in his said account books.15. These discrepancies and contradictions in the evidence of D.W.1 rather than strengthening his case, makes the defence of the accused more suspectable. In addition to the above, admittedly the accused did not inform his banker about alleged theft of the cheque. He did not even issued any 'stop payment' order to the banker though according to him on the very next date of the alleged theft he came to know about the theft of the cheque and issued another cheque to his alleged landlord. Further though he claims to have suspected the complainant on the very same day of he noticing an alleged loss / theft of the cheque, he did not take any action for getting the cheque back either by calling upon the complainant to return the alleged stolen cheque or by lodging a police complaint. Thus the inconsistencies in the defence taken by the accused and inaction on the part of the accused of which action an ordinary and normal prudent man would take, would further weaken the case of the accused rather than he succeeding to rebut the presumption that has been formed in favour of the complainant.

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe case revolves around the alleged violation of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, by the accused who issued a cheque for a loan amount that bounced. The complainant argued that the accused had a legally enforceable debt, while the accused claimed the cheque was stolen. The lower court convicted the accused based on the presumption formed in favour of the complainant. However, the accused's argument that the complainant lacked the financial capacity to lend the amount, and the cheque was stolen, was not considered.\n\nUpon reviewing the case, it is evident that the lower court's decision to convict the accused is questionable. The complainant's financial capacity is in doubt, and the theft of the cheque, as claimed by the accused, was not sufficiently investigated or corroborated. The N.I. Act requires the complainant to prove the existence of a legally enforceable debt, which has not been established in this case.\n\nGiven the lack of evidence supporting the complainant's claim and the potential for the accused's defence to be valid, the lower court's decision to convict the accused should be overturned. Therefore, the appeal is allowed, and the conviction is set aside."

Agarwal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party-State. 3. Heard Mr. Sanjay Kumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party No. This revision has been filed for the following reliefs: - \"This criminal revision has been filed challenging the judgment dated 01.02.2012, passed by learned Sessions Judge, Bokaro in Cr. Appeal No. 81 of 2011, whereby he has affirmed the judgment of conviction and the order of sentence dated 28.07.2011, passed by the st learned Judicial Magistrate, 1 Class, Bokaro in C.P. Case No. 434 of 2004 (T.R. No. 266 of 2011) whereby the petitioner has been convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and has been sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 1,20,000/- out of which Rs. 60,000/- has been directed to be given to the complainant/opposite party No. 2 by way of compensation and in default of payment of fine, he has been directed to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months.\" Arguments of the petitioner he prosecution case, in brief, is that the accused in the month of February, 2003 approached the complainant for financial accommodation as the accused was going to receive two work orders. The accused agreed to give to the complainant 40% of the profit to be accrued out of said purchase orders. The complainant advanced Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh) to the accused for carrying out the job, but the accused did not pay back the money to the complainant and in the first week of January, 2004 on the request of the complainant, the accused issued a cheque of Rs. 49,500/- dated 31.01.2004 and promised to pay rest of the amounts in installments within March, 2004.  The said cheque was deposited in the bank on 07.02.2004, but the same was dishonored on account of \"insufficient fund\". On receipt of aforesaid information, the complainant immediately met the accused at his residence and told him about the dishonor of the cheque. The accused requested the complainant not to take any legal action and issued a fresh cheque of Rs. 55,000/- with a request not to produce the same in the bank till first week of March,\\n\\n2004. On 10.03.2004, another cheque was issued by the accused amounting to Rs. 5,000/-. The complainant was requested by the accused to deposit the said two cheques of Rs. 55,000/- and Rs. 5,000/- after 21.03.2004. On 28.03.2004, the accused requested the complainant not to produce the said cheques before the bank for encashment as the accused was unable to arrange sufficient funds. Thereafter , the complainant received a letter from the accused intimating the complainant that cheque issued by the accused was issued as a security and the accused asked for another Rs. 50,000/- for investment.  After receiving the said letter dated 27.03.2004 of the accused, the complainant met the accused at his residence on 07.04.2004 and the accused informed the complainant that he wrote the letter dated 27.03.2004 on wrong advice of his friend and the accused sought three months from the complainant for depositing sufficient fund in his bank account. On 30.07.2004, the accused informed and confirmed that there are sufficient funds available in his bank account . Accordingly, the complainant deposited the said two cheques dated 16.02.2004 and 10.03.2004 for an amount of Rs. 55,000/- and Rs. 5,000/- respectively which were dishonored on 02.08.2004 on account of \"insufficient fund\". The complainant issued notice to the accused through his Advocate on 17.08.2004 informing about dishonor of cheques and for payment within 15 days. The said notice was sent to the accused through registered post as well as through courier service. Further case of the complainant is that both the letters were served upon the accused on 19.08.2004 and thereafter more than 15 days had elapsed and the accused did not pay the cheque amounts to the complainant, hence the complaint petition was filed. . The complainant had examined altogether two witnesses and exhibited the following materials as exhibits: - (i) Cheque No. 0265373 dated 30.01.2004 marked as Exhibit-1 (ii) Memorandum issued by Vijaya Bank relating to Cheque No. 265373 dated 30.01.2004 of Rs. 49,500/- marked as (Exhibit1/1) (iii) Deposit slip of cheque No. 265373 marked as (Exhibit1/2) (iv) Cheque No. 265372 dated 16.02.2004 of Rs. 55,000/- marked as (Exhibit-2) (v) Memorandum issued by Vijaya Bank relating to cheque No. 265371 dated 10.03.2004 of Rs. 5,000/- and cheque No. 265372 dated 16.02.2004 of Rs. 55,000/- marked as (Exhibit-2/1) (vi) Deposit slip of cheque No. 265372 in Canara Bank marked as (Exhibit 2/2) (vii) Cheque No. 265371 marked as (Exhibit-3) (viii) Deposit slip of cheque No. 265371 in Canara Bank, Bokaro Steel City Branch marked as (Exhibit-3/1 (ix) The letter dated 27.03.2004 of accused Ranglal Ram written to the complainant Balmiki Chaudhary marked as (Exhibit-4) (x) Legal notice issued by the complainant to the accused Ranglal Ram marked as (Exhibit-5) (xi) Letter issued by the learned Advocate of the complainant to the Sub-Post Master, Sub-Post Office, Balidih, Bokaro Steel City, Bokaro marked as (Exhibit-6).\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that it was the specific case of the complainant himself that he was to invest in the business of the accused and in lieu of that, he would be entitled to get 40% profit. He further submits that there have been no accounts regarding profit and the cheques were issued only by way of security and not against any existing debt or liability. The further point which has been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that it is come in the trial court's judgment that the notice was served upon the son of the petitioner and therefore it is submitted that the notice was not served upon the petitioner. He submits that these aspects of the matter have not been properly considered by the learned courts below and accordingly both the judgments are perverse and fit to be set- aside. The said argument was opposed from the side of the prosecution before the learned lower appellate court.  Before this Court, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has raised a specific plea by referring to para-8 of the trial court's judgment and has submitted that it has been recorded by the learned trial court that the notice was served upon the son of the petitioner on 19.08.2004 and accordingly, he has submitted that since the notice has been served upon the son of the petitioner, the same cannot be said to be service of notice upon the petitioner.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nLearned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party-State has relied upon a judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2007) 14 SCC 750 : (AIROnline 2007 SC 161) to submit that there is no illegality or perversity in the impugned judgments passed by the learned courts below regarding finding of service of notice upon the petitioner.  He submits that there can be a number of ways in which the accused can avoid service of notice and in such situation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the moment the accused appears before the learned court below, he has an opportunity to pay the amount by stating that he had not received the notice regarding bouncing of cheque. He further submits that there is no scope for re-appreciation of evidence particularly when the notice as per the petitioner himself was served upon his son who was residing with him. Arguments of the opposite party No.-2  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party No.-2 submits that the learned courts below have rightly appreciated the materials on record and have come to concurrent findings of fact that all the basic ingredients for offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 have been satisfied and accordingly, there is no scope for re-appreciation of evidence and coming to a different finding. He further submits that otherwise also there is presumption of law in connection with existing debt when a cheque is issued and the reverse burden has not been discharged by the petitioner.  He submits that there is no illegality and perversity in the impugned judgments and therefore the present petition is fit to be dismissed. Findings of this Court The specific case of the accused before the learned lower appellate court was that the learned trial court failed to consider that the cheque was issued in a matter of investment in the business of the accused and was not in discharge of any debt and accordingly, Sections 138 to 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act are not attracted.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\n. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bokaro summoned the accused on 16.02.2005 to face trial for offence under Section 418 of Indian Penal Code and Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and subsequently charges were also framed under Section 418 of IPC and Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, after recording the evidence before charge. The charges were read over and explained to the accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.  The learned trial court, after considering the evidences recorded a finding that on 16.02.2004, the accused gave a cheque of Rs. 55,000/- and on 10.03.2004, he gave another cheque of Rs. 5,000/- to the complainant and both the cheques were presented by the complainant for encashment on 31.07.2004 which were dishonored because of \"insufficient fund\". The complainant issued notice dated 17.08.2004 within 30 days of the dishonor of cheque through his Advocate, but within 15 days after the receipt of the notice, the accused did not pay the cheque amounts.  The learned court below considered the presumption that the holder of a cheque received the cheque for discharge of his debt/other liability and after considering the materials on record convicted the accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 but acquitted him for the charge punishable under Section 418 of the Indian Penal Code. he learned lower appellate court dealt with the argument regarding applicability of Sections 138 to 142 of the N.I. Act and was of the view that there is no bar in applicability of Section 138 of the N.I. Act to any cheque issued regarding debt or any liabilities arising out of investment in the business between the parties and rejected the plea of the accused regarding non-applicability of Sections 138 to 142 of the N.I. Act. The learned lower appellate court also considered the contention of the accused regarding legality of the notice marked as Exhibit-5 and was of the view that Exhibit-6 shows that Sub- Post Master, Balidih Post Office had made an endorsement to the effect that the registered letter No. A-976 dated 17.08.2004 was already delivered to the payee on 19.08.2004 and the Exhibit-5 revealed that the amount of cheque was specifically mentioned in the said notice. Hence, the learned lower appellate court found that there was no illegality in the notice marked as Exhibit-5 issued by the lawyer of the complainant and after considering the aforesaid aspects of the matter, the plea regarding legality of the notice was also rejected.\n",
    "Case_Result": "As per the impugned judgements ,the statement of the accused was recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, wherein he admitted that M/s. Kala Enterprises belongs to him and he also admitted that he gave in writing to the complainant to give 40% of his profit. He also admitted having written a letter to the complainant requesting for another Rs. 50,000/- over and above Rs. 1,00,000/- taken by him and told that he has nothing to say in his defence. The accused did not choose to adduce any evidence in his defence.. This Court has considered both the judgments passed by the learned courts below and it is apparent therefrom, that the legal notice regarding bouncing of cheque was sent through registered post as well as through courier service and the learned trial court at para-8 of its judgment has considered the service of legal notice through registered post i.e. through post office as well as the notice sent through courier service.In fact, the learned trial court has recorded that the post office has given in writing that notice i.e. Exhibit-5 and registered letter No. A-976 dated 17.08.2004 was delivered to the payee on 19.08.2004 for which a certificate of the post office was also exhibited and marked as Exhibit-6 and it is only in connection with the notice sent through courier service that it has been recorded that the same was served upon Umesh Kumar, who is the son of the petitioner.Thus, this Court finds that notice was sent through two modes; once through registered post and another through courier service and so far as the registered post is concerned, the same was served upon the petitioner for which the certificate of the post office i.e. Exhibit-6 was exhibited and so far as the courier service is concerned, it is only this courier notice which was served upon the son of the petitioner. This Court finds that there is consistent finding of the learned courts below in connection with service of the registered notice regarding cheque bouncing upon the petitioner after due appreciation of the materials on record particularly Exhibit-5 and Exhibit-6. In the aforesaid view of the matter, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the notice was served upon the son of the petitioner and not upon the petitioner is devoid of any merit. In the instant case, the specific case of the complainant was that he was to invest in the business of the accused and in lieu of that it was agreed he would be entitled to get 40% of the profit and subsequently the accused inter alia issued the aforesaid two cheques. Admittedly, in the present case, the accused has not led any defence evidence. This Court is of the considered view that considering the nature of transactions between the parties and read with the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act that the cheque was issued against discharge of existing debt or other liability, the argument of the petitioner that the same was issued by way of security has no legal basis and accordingly, this Court finds that the accused could not discharge his onus against the presumption of cheque having been drawn in discharge of liability. This Court further finds that so far as the other point raised by the petitioner, that there have been no accounts regarding profit and the cheques were issued only by way of security and not any existing debt is concerned, the same is also fit to be rejected. This Court finds that the learned court below has dealt with the plea of the petitioner regarding applicability of Sections 138 to 142 of the N.I. Act and in view of the presumption raised under Section 139 of the N.I. Act, the aforesaid plea of the petitioner has no legal basis. Admittedly, the petitioner did not adduce any defence evidence. Petition dismissed",

Parties are referred to as per their status before the trial Court.  This revision petition has been preferred by accused aggrieved by judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 22.2.2019, passed by I Addl. Civil Judge and JMFC, Dharwad, in C. C.No.22/2018, convicting petitioner for the offence punishable under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 ('the Act' for short) and sentencing him to pay a fine of Rs. 4,52,000/-, in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months. Out of the fine amount, Rs. 4,51,000/- was ordered to be paid to complainant and Rs. 1,000/- was ordered to be paid to State.  Brief facts leading to filing of this revision petition are that, it is the case of complainant that himself and accused are well known to each other and due to their acquaintance and intimacy, accused received loan of Rs. 4,50,000/- from complainant and issued a cheque for Rs. 4,50,000/- towards repayment of loan vide cheque bearing No.319509 dated 11.8.2017.  On presentation of said cheque, the same came to be dishonoured for the reason 'funds insufficient' on 1.11.2017. Thereafter complainant got issued legal notice to accused on 13.11.2017. Despite service of notice to accused, no reply was sent and the amount so demanded was not repaid. Hence complainant filed a complaint under section 200 of Cr.P. C. for the offence punishable under section 138 of the Act. 6. After filing of complaint, cognizance was taken by the trial Court and on receipt of summons, accused appeared before the Court and pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried and accordingly he was tried. Thereafter complainant's sworn statement was recorded and it was treated as his evidence and he got marked Exs.P.1 to P.5 and closed his side.  Thereafter, statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P.C. was recorded. Accused denied all incriminating evidence against him, but he did not choose to cross examine complainant neither let-in evidence on his behalf Aggrieved by the said judgment, accused challenged the same before the District and Sessions Court in Crl. A. No.25/2019. On examining the material evidence placed before the Court and after re-appreciating the evidence on record, the appellate Court came to conclusion that accused is guilty of offence punishable under section 138 of the Act. Aggrieved by the judgment of conviction by trial Court and confirmation by appellate Court, accused is before this Court challenging the legality, correctness and validity of judgments of both the Courts.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  On challenge, the said judgment of trial Court has been confirmed by the Prl. District and Sessions Court, Dharwad, by judgment dated 1.7.2020 in Crl.A. No.25/2019.  On the basis of material evidence and documents produced by complainant, the trial Court came to a conclusion that complainant has proved necessary ingredients of section 138 of the Act and convicted accused for the offence punishable under section 138 of the Act and sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 4,52,000/-. Appellate Court held that as per law Court is empowered to impose fine of double the amount of cheque. It has confirmed the judgment of trial Court and did not interfere with the same.  Thereafter, on 22.2.2019 judgment was pronounced by trial Court convicting accused for the offence punishable under section 138 of N.I. Act. Aggrieved by this judgment accused preferred an appeal.  On considering contentions of accused and relying on the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank Association (supra), appellate Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the order passed by trial Court.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: . Learned counsel for petitioner contends that order of conviction passed by trial Court and confirmation of the same by appellate Court is not in accordance with law and opposed to principles of natural justice.  The same deserves to be set aside and an opportunity has to be provided to accused to defend his case effectively. It is further contended by learned counsel for petitioner that since no opportunity was provided to accused to cross examine PW.1/complainant, he was unable to confront the witness by producing material evidence in support of his case to disprove the case of complainant. 9. It is his contention that complainant has misused the cheque to make unlawful gain and the same was not issued for realization of any legally recoverable debt. He further contends that both the Courts have gravely erred in coming to a conclusion that case of complainant is proved beyond reasonable doubt despite not providing any opportunity to accused to rebut the presumption cast against him. Learned counsel further contends that the judgment of both Courts suffers from serious infirmities and on account of non providing sufficient opportunities to accused, the same deserves to be reversed. On these aspects learned counsel seeks to allow this revision petition and set aside the orders passed by both the Courts and to acquit petitioner.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  Per contra, learned counsel for respondent contends that order passed by trial Court convicting accused and confirmed by appellate Court is in accordance with law and the materials placed on record. The same does not call for any interference. He contends that complainant has followed necessary procedure for adducing evidence and sufficient time was provided to accused to cross examine PW.1, but the same has not been utilized and rightly trial Court has convicted accused for the aforesaid offence. . Learned counsel further contends that intent of legislature is to dispose of the case pertaining to Negotiable Instruments Act within a period of six months in accordance with law. Trial Court accorded sufficient opportunity to accused to examine witnesses, but despite providing sufficient opportunity, the same was not utilized and hence convicted accused for the aforesaid offence which has been confirmed by appellate Court. Learned counsel for respondent contends that there is no illegality or perversity in the orders passed by trial Court and appellate Court. The same is in accordance with law and the precedent laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court for disposal of cases punishable under section 138 of the Act.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: Heard Shri T.R.Patil, learned counsel for petitioner and Shri Praveen P. Tarikar, learned counsel for respondent. .. Having heard learned counsel for petitioner and respondent, a short point that arises for consideration is whether there is any illegality or perversity committed by the Court below in passing the impugned order. . During the course of arguments before this Court, learned counsel for petitioner has produced order sheet of trial Court to show that no opportunity was provided to him. On perusal of order sheet, it is seen that on 21.1.2019 accused appeared before trial Court, filed an application for grant of bail under section 436 of Cr.P. C.  The same was allowed and on the same day plea of accused was recorded, wherein accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Trial Court relying on the judgment of Hon' ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association and others vs. Union of India and others, reported in (2014) 5 SCC 590, treated the sworn statement of complainant as evidence, closed the side of complainant and recorded statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C. and posted the matter on 24.1.2019 for evidence of accused.  On 24.1.2019, both parties tried to settle the matter but same was unsuccessful and accordingly the matter was posted for accused evidence on 8.2.2019, on which date accused remained absent. Since no evidence was adduced by accused, the same was taken as nil and thereafter matter was posted for arguments on 16.2.2019.  On 16.2.2019 accused remained absent, no representation was made, arguments of accused were taken as nil and the matter was posted for judgment on 22.2.2019.  . During the course of arguments before this Court, learned counsel for petitioner has pleaded that he has a very good case on merit and if an opportunity is provided, he will be able to establish and rebut the presumption cast on him by disproving the case of complainant. Learned counsel has restricted his argument to remit the case back to trial Court for adjudication of the matter by providing an opportunity to adduce defence evidence.  It is seen in the orders passed on 21.1.2019 that trial Court has relied on a judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association (supra) and has rightly treated the sworn statement as evidence and thereafter recorded statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C. and posted the matter for defence evidence Thereafter matter was adjourned for two dates providing opportunity to accused to adduce evidence. Since no evidence was let-in by accused, the matter was posted for judgment, pursuant to which judgment was pronounced.  Considering the intent of legislature and the judgment passed by Hon'ble Apex Court in Indian Bank Association (supra), wherein guidelines have been laid down with regard to disposal of matters pertaining to Negotiable Instruments Act. It is seen that there is no illegality committed, per-se, in treating sworn statement as evidence and recording statement of accused under section 313 of Cr. P.C. on the same day and posting the matter for defence evidence.  As this is a summary trial, parties can adduce evidence by way of affidavit and there is nothing wrong in treating the sworn statement as evidence and recording statement of accused under section 313 of Cr.P. C., on the same day. In the aforesaid judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court, it is held that, Courts must ensure examination-in-chief and cross-examination and re-examination of complainant to be conducted within three months and thereafter accused must examine witnesses and be available for cross-examination as and when directed by trial Court and there is no dispute that speedy and expeditious procedure should be adopted by trial Court dealing with the matters pertaining to section 138 of the N.I.Act.  In the present case on hand, during the course of arguments learned counsel for petitioner has submitted that an opportunity may be given to him to cross examine complainant and to lead his evidence for which conditions may be imposed by this Court and he is agreeable to deposit entire cheque amount within one month from the date of receipt of certified copy of this order.  It is seen from records that the trial Court has followed the ratio and the principles laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Indian Bank Association stated supra. But, what is to be seen here is whether in order to provide substantial justice to parties, an opportunity could be provided to accused by imposing certain conditions which should not be detrimental to the interest of the complainant. Learned counsel for the complainant consents to the matter being remanded to trial Court with a condition that accused deposits entire cheque amount and a specific time limit is provided for adducing evidence by accused and for conclusion of the case.  In such circumstances, in the interest of principle of natural justice and with an intention to provide an opportunity for accused to put forth his case by cross examining the complainant and by adducing his own evidence where no harm or grave injustice would be caused to complainant, the matter could be remanded back to trial Court. This Court is not subscribing to the lackadaisical attitude of accused in not availing opportunity provided by trial Court. Nevertheless, in the interest of principle of natural justice and to provide substantial justice to parties and with consent of counsel for the petitioner and counsel for respondent this matter could be remanded to trial Court for recording of evidence of accused and for cross examination of PW.1 complainant.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "1. The main issue of the case is whether the lower court correctly ruled that the petitioner was guilty of an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 for issuing a cheque in a dishonoured state for payment of a debt or other liability.\n\n2. The lower court's judgment appears to be correct based on the evidence presented. The petitioner admitted to issuing cheques for an amount exceeding Rs. 50,000/- to the complainant, which were dishonoured due to insufficient funds. He also failed to pay the cheque amounts within 15 days of receiving a notice from the complainant. These actions, as per the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act, constitute an offence under Section 138. The plea that the cheques were issued in a matter of investment in the business of the accused and not in discharge of any debt or liability was not substantiated by any concrete evidence.\n\n3. Based on the analysis, the appeal should be dismissed. The petitioner's arguments do not sufficiently challenge the lower court's judgment, and the evidence presented supports the conviction.\n\nOutput: DISMISSED"

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nHeard Mr. S. K. Laik, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no. 2. Heard Ms. Niki Sinha, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party -State.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned counsel for the petitioner, while advancing her argument, has submitted that the learned courts below have not properly considered the defence evidence that the accused had left his cheque at the house of Mr. Jain Saheb and in spite of request made by the accused, the cheque was not returned and, in fact, said Mr. Jain Saheb had refused to return the cheque. She submits that in view of the evidence of D.W. 1 , the learned trial court has wrongly convicted the petitioner under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act,1881.  However, during the course of argument, the learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to various dates and has submitted that the cheque involved in this case was dated 18.07.2009 for an amount of Rs. 3 lakhs, which was deposited in the account of the accused on 20.07.2009 and the same had bounced.  The complainant had received the information regarding bouncing of cheque on 31.07.2009. The required legal notice was sent on 26.08.2009 which was served upon the accused on 31.08.2009 and in spite of that, the accused did not pay the cheque amount. Thereafter, the complaint case was filed on 24.09.2009. The learned counsel submits that the main point for argument of the petitioner is that there was no debt payable to the complainant and in fact, the complainant had misused the cheque.  During the course of argument, the learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that without prejudice to the aforesaid submission, considering the facts and circumstances of this case the sentence of the petitioner be modified She submits that the petitioner may be directed to pay some more amount as fine over and above the compensation amount within a stipulated time and the sentence be limited to the period already undergone. She submits that the petitioner has remained in custody for some time. She submits that at the stage of revision the petitioner had surrendered on 27.07.2012 and was directed to be released on bail by this Court vide order dated 23.08.2012.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nThe learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no. 2, on the other hand, has submitted that there is presumption in law that the cheque has been issued against a debt under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and over and above the presumption in law , the complainant had explained as to how the amount was payable to the complainant. It has come in evidence that the complainant had talked with the accused regarding purchase of land and the accused had shown photocopies of the documents regarding the land. The complainant agreed to purchase the land and the value of the land was fixed at Rs. 11,50,000/-. The complainant made a payment of Rs. 3 lakhs in advance to the accused and on different dates a total amount of Rs. 8.50 lakhs was paid. Thus, she paid an amount of Rs. 11.5 lakhs and subsequently, when she learnt that the document relating to the land was forged, the accused had issued a cheque of Rs. 3 lakhs by way of return of the amount and, in fact, accused gave total 4 cheques all dated 18.07.2009 of Rs. 3 lakhs each. He submits that apart from the presumption, the purpose for which the cheque was involved was to discharge the liability of the accused and accordingly, the story which has been placed by the petitioner that the cheque was left in the house of Jain Saheb who refused to return the cheque, has been considered and rejected by the learned court below by consistent finding of facts. The learned counsel also submits that in revisional jurisdiction, there is no scope for re-appreciation of evidence and coming to a different finding. He also submits that so far as the timelines are concerned, the same has been strictly followed in the instant case and there is no illegality or perversity in the impugned judgements. However, during the course of argument, the learned counsel for the opposite party no. 2 submits that considering the fact that the opposite party no. 2 is a widow, he has taken instructions from her that if the compensation amount is enhanced by Rs. 1 lakh, she has no objection for modification of the sentence of the petitioner and limiting it to the period already served by the petitioner in custody.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe present revision application has been filed against the judgement dated 29.06.2012 passed by the learned District and Additional Sessions Judge- V, Ranchi in Criminal Appeal No. 35 of 2011 whereby the learned District and Additional Sessions Judge-V has dismissed the criminal appeal which was filed against the judgement dated 09.02.2011 passed by the learned st Judicial Magistrate, 1 Class, Ranchi in connection with C-2287 of 2009/ T.R. No. 1102 of 2011.  The learned Judicial Magistrate, st 1 Class has been pleased to convict the petitioner under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced him to undergo Simple Imprisonment for a period of six months and has directed for payment of compensation of Rs. 3 lakhs to the complainant under Section 357(3) of Cr.P.C. 11. The learned trial court gave its finding in para 10 of its judgement which is quoted as under:\\n\\n\"10. Perusal of evidence of complainant (C.W.1), documentary evidence it is clear that complainant has proved the cheque of Rs. 3 lacs dated 18.7.09 bearing signature of accused as Exhibit-1, the counter file of pay-in-slip dated 20.7.09 regarding deposit the cheque in her account for encashment as Exhibit-2, the letter of State Bank of India CMPDI Branch, Ranchi dated 25.7.09 regarding cheque return unpaid as Exhibit-3, her signature as well as signature of her advocate on legal notice dated 26.8.09 as Exhibit- 4 and Exhibit-4/1 respectively and postal registry receipt regarding sending of legal notice to the accused as Exhibit-5. C.W. 1 complainant Chaitali Dutta during her evidence has also corroborated the aforesaid facts and stated that to return the money accused had issued four cheques, and she has filed this case for one cheque of Rs. 3 lacs which was bounced due to insufficient fund in the account of accused. He deposed in chief examination that aforesaid cheque (Exhibit-1) bears the signature of accused. During cross examination defence has not put any question to contradict the aforesaid fact. The documentary evidence as well as oral evidence given by the complainant shows that the necessary requirements regarding the time limit for prosecution of the offence u/s 138 of N.I Act has been complied by the complainant. She had issued legal notice after receiving the information regarding bouncing of the cheque under prescribed time limit for the offence u/s 138 of N.I. Act and also she has filed this case under time limit as prescribed under N.I. Act for prosecution u/s 138 of N.I. Act. Complainant during her evidence has stated that the cheque was bounced due to insufficient fund in the account of accused and during her cross examination defence has not put any question to contradict the aforesaid facts also during defence evidence stage no any evidence has been produced on behalf of accused which could contradict the aforesaid facts of dishonour of his cheque for insufficient fund in his account. Therefore, the evidence given by the complainant regarding dishonoured of cheque due to insufficient fund in the account of the accused is unrebutted by the defence and hence complainant successfully prove the facts that the cheque was dishonoured due to insufficient fund in the account of accused.\" Further, in para 11 and 12 of the trial court judgement, the learned court below has fully considered the defence evidence regarding the misuse of cheque by the accused and after considering the evidences on record and also the presumption in law, gave a clear finding that the defence could not establish his defence that the accused had not issued the alleged cheque for discharge in whole or in part of any debt or liability. 13. The learned lower appellate court gave its findings in para 15 of its judgement which is quoted as under:\\n\\n\"15. From perusal of the evidence oral and documentary available on the record, it transpires that cheque dated 18.07.2009 signed by the accused/appellant Rakesh Pandey was presented before the bank within a time and it has been marked as Ext.1. The counter- foil of pay-in-slip regarding deposit of the aforesaid cheque in the account of the complainant dated 20.07.2009 has been marked as Ext.2, letter of information of SBI, CMPDI Branch (Ranchi) regarding information of return cheque unpaid dated 25.07.2009 has been marked as Ext. 3. Signature of complainant Chaitali Dutta her Advocate Sri B. D. Banerjee on legal notice dated 26.08.2009 has been marked as Ext. 4 and 4/1. Pay-in-slip regarding pending of legal notice to the accused Rakesh Pandey has been marked as Ext. 5. C.W 1 has supported her case during her evidence on oath before the court below. I find that the case was instituted within 30 days of service of legal notice and therefore the time framed proved under statue u/s 138 of N.I. Act. C.W. 1 has herself stated that she gave rupees three lacs as an advance to the accused to purchase the land. After some time she came to know that the accused/appellant showed her the document regarding the land is forged and fabricated. Thereafter she requested the accused to return her money for which the appellant/accused issued a cheque bearing no. 115732 dt. 18.07.2009 for Rs. 3,00,000/-. When the complainant presented the cheque in the SBI, CMPDI Branch (Ranchi) but the cheque was dishonoured due to insufficient fund in the account of accused. Thus, in view of the fact and circumstances above discussed I find and hold that the prosecution has been able to establish that the cheque for amount of rupees three lacs which was issued by the accused/appellant was for discharge of liability as payment. All the ingredients necessary established offence u/s 138 of N.I. Act has been established beyond all reasonable doubts and accordingly the accused/appellant is found and held guilty for offence u/s 138 of N.I. Act. The learned Magistrate has rightly passed the impugned judgment dated 09.02.2011. Considered the contention of the parties. Perused the materials on the record, the charge has been proved against the accused/appellant is covered u/s 138 of N.I. Act which is a special Act. The offence relates to economic in nature. I come to the conclusion and accordingly hold here that the conviction of the st appellant made by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1 Class, Ranchi u/s 138 of the N.I. Act is justified. The conviction and st sentence u/s 138 made by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1 Class, Ranchi sentence to undergo S.I for six months and further ordered to pay compensation of Rs. 3,00,000/- to the complainant u/s 357(3) of Cr.P.C. is hereby confirmed. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed.\"\n",

Heard Mr. P. D. Agarwal, learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party-State. 3. Heard Mr. Sanjay Kumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party No. This revision has been filed for the following reliefs: - \"This criminal revision has been filed challenging the judgment dated 01.02.2012, passed by learned Sessions Judge, Bokaro in Cr. Appeal No. 81 of 2011, whereby he has affirmed the judgment of conviction and the order of sentence dated 28.07.2011, passed by the st learned Judicial Magistrate, 1 Class, Bokaro in C.P. Case No. 434 of 2004 (T.R. No. 266 of 2011) whereby the petitioner has been convicted for the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and has been sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 1,20,000/- out of which Rs. 60,000/- has been directed to be given to the complainant/opposite party No. 2 by way of compensation and in default of payment of fine, he has been directed to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of six months.\" Arguments of the petitioner he prosecution case, in brief, is that the accused in the month of February, 2003 approached the complainant for financial accommodation as the accused was going to receive two work orders. The accused agreed to give to the complainant 40% of the profit to be accrued out of said purchase orders. The complainant advanced Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh) to the accused for carrying out the job, but the accused did not pay back the money to the complainant and in the first week of January, 2004 on the request of the complainant, the accused issued a cheque of Rs. 49,500/- dated 31.01.2004 and promised to pay rest of the amounts in installments within March, 2004.  The said cheque was deposited in the bank on 07.02.2004, but the same was dishonored on account of \"insufficient fund\". On receipt of aforesaid information, the complainant immediately met the accused at his residence and told him about the dishonor of the cheque. The accused requested the complainant not to take any legal action and issued a fresh cheque of Rs. 55,000/- with a request not to produce the same in the bank till first week of March,\\n\\n2004. On 10.03.2004, another cheque was issued by the accused amounting to Rs. 5,000/-. The complainant was requested by the accused to deposit the said two cheques of Rs. 55,000/- and Rs. 5,000/- after 21.03.2004. On 28.03.2004, the accused requested the complainant not to produce the said cheques before the bank for encashment as the accused was unable to arrange sufficient funds. Thereafter , the complainant received a letter from the accused intimating the complainant that cheque issued by the accused was issued as a security and the accused asked for another Rs. 50,000/- for investment.  After receiving the said letter dated 27.03.2004 of the accused, the complainant met the accused at his residence on 07.04.2004 and the accused informed the complainant that he wrote the letter dated 27.03.2004 on wrong advice of his friend and the accused sought three months from the complainant for depositing sufficient fund in his bank account. On 30.07.2004, the accused informed and confirmed that there are sufficient funds available in his bank account . Accordingly, the complainant deposited the said two cheques dated 16.02.2004 and 10.03.2004 for an amount of Rs. 55,000/- and Rs. 5,000/- respectively which were dishonored on 02.08.2004 on account of \"insufficient fund\". The complainant issued notice to the accused through his Advocate on 17.08.2004 informing about dishonor of cheques and for payment within 15 days. The said notice was sent to the accused through registered post as well as through courier service. Further case of the complainant is that both the letters were served upon the accused on 19.08.2004 and thereafter more than 15 days had elapsed and the accused did not pay the cheque amounts to the complainant, hence the complaint petition was filed. . The complainant had examined altogether two witnesses and exhibited the following materials as exhibits: - (i) Cheque No. 0265373 dated 30.01.2004 marked as Exhibit-1 (ii) Memorandum issued by Vijaya Bank relating to Cheque No. 265373 dated 30.01.2004 of Rs. 49,500/- marked as (Exhibit1/1) (iii) Deposit slip of cheque No. 265373 marked as (Exhibit1/2) (iv) Cheque No. 265372 dated 16.02.2004 of Rs. 55,000/- marked as (Exhibit-2) (v) Memorandum issued by Vijaya Bank relating to cheque No. 265371 dated 10.03.2004 of Rs. 5,000/- and cheque No. 265372 dated 16.02.2004 of Rs. 55,000/- marked as (Exhibit-2/1) (vi) Deposit slip of cheque No. 265372 in Canara Bank marked as (Exhibit 2/2) (vii) Cheque No. 265371 marked as (Exhibit-3) (viii) Deposit slip of cheque No. 265371 in Canara Bank, Bokaro Steel City Branch marked as (Exhibit-3/1 (ix) The letter dated 27.03.2004 of accused Ranglal Ram written to the complainant Balmiki Chaudhary marked as (Exhibit-4) (x) Legal notice issued by the complainant to the accused Ranglal Ram marked as (Exhibit-5) (xi) Letter issued by the learned Advocate of the complainant to the Sub-Post Master, Sub-Post Office, Balidih, Bokaro Steel City, Bokaro marked as (Exhibit-6).\n**Ruling by Lower Court**: . The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Bokaro summoned the accused on 16.02.2005 to face trial for offence under Section 418 of Indian Penal Code and Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and subsequently charges were also framed under Section 418 of IPC and Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, after recording the evidence before charge. The charges were read over and explained to the accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.  The learned trial court, after considering the evidences recorded a finding that on 16.02.2004, the accused gave a cheque of Rs. 55,000/- and on 10.03.2004, he gave another cheque of Rs. 5,000/- to the complainant and both the cheques were presented by the complainant for encashment on 31.07.2004 which were dishonored because of \"insufficient fund\". The complainant issued notice dated 17.08.2004 within 30 days of the dishonor of cheque through his Advocate, but within 15 days after the receipt of the notice, the accused did not pay the cheque amounts.  The learned court below considered the presumption that the holder of a cheque received the cheque for discharge of his debt/other liability and after considering the materials on record convicted the accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 but acquitted him for the charge punishable under Section 418 of the Indian Penal Code. he learned lower appellate court dealt with the argument regarding applicability of Sections 138 to 142 of the N.I. Act and was of the view that there is no bar in applicability of Section 138 of the N.I. Act to any cheque issued regarding debt or any liabilities arising out of investment in the business between the parties and rejected the plea of the accused regarding non-applicability of Sections 138 to 142 of the N.I. Act. The learned lower appellate court also considered the contention of the accused regarding legality of the notice marked as Exhibit-5 and was of the view that Exhibit-6 shows that Sub- Post Master, Balidih Post Office had made an endorsement to the effect that the registered letter No. A-976 dated 17.08.2004 was already delivered to the payee on 19.08.2004 and the Exhibit-5 revealed that the amount of cheque was specifically mentioned in the said notice. Hence, the learned lower appellate court found that there was no illegality in the notice marked as Exhibit-5 issued by the lawyer of the complainant and after considering the aforesaid aspects of the matter, the plea regarding legality of the notice was also rejected.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that it was the specific case of the complainant himself that he was to invest in the business of the accused and in lieu of that, he would be entitled to get 40% profit. He further submits that there have been no accounts regarding profit and the cheques were issued only by way of security and not against any existing debt or liability. The further point which has been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that it is come in the trial court's judgment that the notice was served upon the son of the petitioner and therefore it is submitted that the notice was not served upon the petitioner. He submits that these aspects of the matter have not been properly considered by the learned courts below and accordingly both the judgments are perverse and fit to be set- aside. The said argument was opposed from the side of the prosecution before the learned lower appellate court.  Before this Court, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has raised a specific plea by referring to para-8 of the trial court's judgment and has submitted that it has been recorded by the learned trial court that the notice was served upon the son of the petitioner on 19.08.2004 and accordingly, he has submitted that since the notice has been served upon the son of the petitioner, the same cannot be said to be service of notice upon the petitioner.\n**Argument by Respondent**: Learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party-State has relied upon a judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2007) 14 SCC 750 : (AIROnline 2007 SC 161) to submit that there is no illegality or perversity in the impugned judgments passed by the learned courts below regarding finding of service of notice upon the petitioner.  He submits that there can be a number of ways in which the accused can avoid service of notice and in such situation, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the moment the accused appears before the learned court below, he has an opportunity to pay the amount by stating that he had not received the notice regarding bouncing of cheque. He further submits that there is no scope for re-appreciation of evidence particularly when the notice as per the petitioner himself was served upon his son who was residing with him. Arguments of the opposite party No.-2  Learned counsel appearing on behalf of opposite party No.-2 submits that the learned courts below have rightly appreciated the materials on record and have come to concurrent findings of fact that all the basic ingredients for offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 have been satisfied and accordingly, there is no scope for re-appreciation of evidence and coming to a different finding. He further submits that otherwise also there is presumption of law in connection with existing debt when a cheque is issued and the reverse burden has not been discharged by the petitioner.  He submits that there is no illegality and perversity in the impugned judgments and therefore the present petition is fit to be dismissed. Findings of this Court The specific case of the accused before the learned lower appellate court was that the learned trial court failed to consider that the cheque was issued in a matter of investment in the business of the accused and was not in discharge of any debt and accordingly, Sections 138 to 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act are not attracted.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  As per the impugned judgements ,the statement of the accused was recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, wherein he admitted that M/s. Kala Enterprises belongs to him and he also admitted that he gave in writing to the complainant to give 40% of his profit.  He also admitted having written a letter to the complainant requesting for another Rs. 50,000/- over and above Rs. 1,00,000/- taken by him and told that he has nothing to say in his defence. The accused did not choose to adduce any evidence in his defence. . This Court has considered both the judgments passed by the learned courts below and it is apparent therefrom, that the legal notice regarding bouncing of cheque was sent through registered post as well as through courier service and the learned trial court at para-8 of its judgment has considered the service of legal notice through registered post i.e. through post office as well as the notice sent through courier service. In fact, the learned trial court has recorded that the post office has given in writing that notice i.e. Exhibit-5 and registered letter No. A-976 dated 17.08.2004 was delivered to the payee on 19.08.2004 for which a certificate of the post office was also exhibited and marked as Exhibit-6 and it is only in connection with the notice sent through courier service that it has been recorded that the same was served upon Umesh Kumar, who is the son of the petitioner. Thus, this Court finds that notice was sent through two modes; once through registered post and another through courier service and so far as the registered post is concerned, the same was served upon the petitioner for which the certificate of the post office i.e. Exhibit-6 was exhibited and so far as the courier service is concerned, it is only this courier notice which was served upon the son of the petitioner.  This Court finds that there is consistent finding of the learned courts below in connection with service of the registered notice regarding cheque bouncing upon the petitioner after due appreciation of the materials on record particularly Exhibit-5 and Exhibit-6. In the aforesaid view of the matter, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the notice was served upon the son of the petitioner and not upon the petitioner is devoid of any merit.  In the instant case, the specific case of the complainant was that he was to invest in the business of the accused and in lieu of that it was agreed he would be entitled to get 40% of the profit and subsequently the accused inter alia issued the aforesaid two cheques. Admittedly, in the present case, the accused has not led any defence evidence. This Court is of the considered view that considering the nature of transactions between the parties and read with the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act that the cheque was issued against discharge of existing debt or other liability, the argument of the petitioner that the same was issued by way of security has no legal basis and accordingly, this Court finds that the accused could not discharge his onus against the presumption of cheque having been drawn in discharge of liability.  This Court further finds that so far as the other point raised by the petitioner, that there have been no accounts regarding profit and the cheques were issued only by way of security and not any existing debt is concerned, the same is also fit to be rejected. This Court finds that the learned court below has dealt with the plea of the petitioner regarding applicability of Sections 138 to 142 of the N.I. Act and in view of the presumption raised under Section 139 of the N.I. Act, the aforesaid plea of the petitioner has no legal basis. Admittedly, the petitioner did not adduce any defence evidence. \n",

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n2. Heard Mr. P.D. Agrawal, the learned A.P.P. appearing on behalf of the Opposite Party-State.  Heard Mr. Rohit Ranjan Sinha, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of Opposite Party No.2.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the impugned judgement of conviction of the petitioner is ex-facie perverse in view of the fact that the condition precedent for filing the complaint case was itself not satisfied. The learned counsel submitted that in the present case, the legal notice was sent on 16.01.2003 through registered post and the complaint case was filed on 11.02.2003.  He referred to the complaint petition as well as the impugned judgement to submit that there is no averment regarding the fact as to what happened to the legal notice and even if the legal notice is assumed to be served upon the accused, then also 30 days from 16.01.2003 would expire only on or about 15.02.2003 and thereafter, 15 days was required to be given to the accused to pay the cheque amount, but in the instant case the complaint was filed on 11.02.2003 and accordingly, the complaint itself was premature.\nArgument by the Respondent:\nhe learned counsel for the Opposite Party No.2, while opposing the prayer, submitted that there are concurrent findings recorded by the learned courts below convicting the petitioner under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act and therefore, the same may not be interfered with in revisional jurisdiction.  However, during the course of argument, it has not been disputed that the legal notice was sent on 16.01.2003 and the complaint case was filed on 11.02.2003. Admittedly, there is no evidence or averment with regard to service of legal notice and/or as to what happened to the legal notice.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe present criminal revision petition has been filed challenging the judgement dated 22.11.2010 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, F.T.C.- III, Dhanbad in Criminal Appeal No. 115 of 2008 whereby the judgement of conviction and the order of sentence both dated 03.04.2008 st passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1 Class, Dhanbad in C.P. No. 179 of 2003 has been affirmed and the criminal appeal has been dismissed.  The petitioner has been convicted for offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act and has been sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a term of six months and to pay a fine of Rs. 2 lakhs and in case of default of payment of fine, the petitioner has been directed to further undergo Simple Imprisonment for three months.  The learned trial court, while convicting the petitioner, held that once a cheque is signed and issued, there is presumption that the same was issued against a debt or liability. The appellate court recorded that Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act has three ingredients: (i) There should be a legally enforceable debt, (ii) That the cheque was drawn from the account of the bank for discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability which pre-supposes a legally enforceable debt, and (iii) That the cheque so issued has been returned due to insufficiency of fund. 4 The learned appellate court referred to Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act regarding presumption in favour of the holder of the cheque.  The learned appellate court ultimately recorded its findings at Para-10 which read as follows:\\n\\n\"10. In the light of the aforesaid, it has to be seen whether the case comes under the purview of all the ingredients. On the basis of the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the complainant, it is clear that the ingredients of Section 138 of N.I. Act are present. It is not in dispute that the cheque in question was issued by the accused in favour of M/s Raju Construction. It is an admitted fact the complainant is the proprietor of this firm. The cheque was also returned by the Bank due to insufficient fund and the memo of the Bank bears the seal of the Bank. The legal notice was sent through Ext. 5. Inspite of receiving the notice the accused did not make any payment. The accused has failed to contradict the prosecution witnesses in cross- examination. The defence version does not receive support nor the accused has failed to rebut the presumption.\"\n",
    "Case_Result": "After hearing the learned counsel for the parties, this Court finds that altogether three witnesses were examined from the side of the prosecution. Exhibit-1 is the cheque dated 09.09.2002, Exhibit- 2 and 3 are the cheque return memos dated 26.09.2002 and 04.01.2003 respectively and the case was filed pursuant to bouncing of cheque on 04.01.2003. Exhibit- 4 is the postal receipt dated 16.01.2003 with regard to the demand notice dated 16.01.2003 marked as Exhibit- 5. It is not in dispute that the cheque had bounced on account of insufficient fund.Upon perusal of the impugned judgements, it appears that none of the witnesses has stated as to what happened to the legal notice and as to whether the same was served or not. A defence witness was also produced from the side of the accused indicating that he had intimated in the police station regarding loss of cheques and the defence evidence was also considered by the learned trial court indicating that the information to police (Exhibit-A with objection) did not even state the number of cheques and their numbers which were lost and accordingly, the defence evidence was rejected by the learned trial court.However, the learned trial court did not record any specific finding with regard to compliance of the other preconditions to constitute an offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act for the purposes of even filing a criminal case under the said section.12. This Court finds that both the learned courts below have apparently ignored one of the pre- conditions for filing a Complaint for the offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act i.e. the service of notice upon the accused and thereafter, 15 days' time to the accused to pay the cheque amount.The learned appellate court has recorded that the legal notice was sent through Exhibit-5 and in spite of receiving a notice, the accused did not make the payment and the accused has failed to contradict the prosecution witnesses in cross- examination.This Court finds that the law has been well settled by the aforesaid judgements that the cause of action for filing a complaint case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act could not arise prior to expiry of 15 days from the date of service of legal notice on the accused and in case of absence of proof of service of notice sent under registered cover or speed- post at the correct address, the deemed service of notice can be taken only upon expiry of 30 days from its dispatch.he learned courts below have not recorded any finding with regard to the date of service of notice or presumption, if any, regarding service of notice so as to calculate the timeline with regard to filing of the Complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Admittedly, there is no evidence on record regarding service of notice upon the petitioner. Even if the best case of the complainant is taken into consideration that the notice sent under registered cover is to be taken as deemed to have been served upon the accused only upon expiry of 30 days from the date of its issuance and thereafter, 15 days is to be counted for the purpose of granting opportunity to the accused to pay the cheque amount and upon expiry of the period of fifteen days from deemed service of notice, cause of action to file a case under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act can arise. In the instant case, legal notice having been issued on 16.01.2003, the deemed service at best could have been taken on or about 15.02.2003 and the case was filed on 11.02.2003.17. Considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances, this Court is of the considered view that the complaint filed by the complainant was premature as the cause of action for filing the complaint case under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act was not crystalized on the date of filing of the complaint on 11.02.2003 and accordingly, the condition precedent for filing the complaint case under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 having not been satisfied, the conviction and sentence of the petitioner cannot be sustained in the eyes of law.

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9a1c\n**Facts**:  Heard the learned counsel for the parties.  This revision application has been filed against the order of acquittal passed on 27.11.2013 by the learned Additional Sessions Judge-II, Jamshedpur in Criminal Appeal No. 287/2012, whereby the judgment dated 09.10.2012 passed by the learned Judicial Magistrate, 1St Class, Jamshedpur in Complaint Case No. 1377/2008, T.R. No. 505/2012, has been set aside. The learned trial court has convicted the accused (opposite party No. -2) under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and sentenced him for six months imprisonment and further directed to pay Rs. 2,20,000/- as compensation to the petitioner.  The complainant of the case is the petitioner in this revision petition.\\n\\n4. The complaint was filed under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act as well as under Section 420 of Indian Penal Code, but admittedly, cognizance was taken only under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  The learned trial court rejected the plea that the accused did not know the complainant and that he had met him for the first time in the court, by holding that if the complainant did not know the accused, then how he could know the particulars and address about the accused and could also send the notice at his address. The learned trial court ultimately held that the complainant had established his case against the accused and on the other hand, the accused failed to establish that the cheque was not issued towards discharge of any debt or other liability and held that the accused failed to rebut the presumption as provided under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act and accordingly held the accused guilty of offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The learned lower appellate court allowed the appeal and set-aside the judgment of the trial court by holding that the accused had rebutted the presumption under section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by applying the principles of 'preponderance of probabilities' and further the complainant could not discharge his burden of proof upon such rebuttal by the accused . The learned lower appellate court has dealt with each of the points regarding rebuttal of presumption under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act under different heads in para 12 of the judgment. While deciding this point, the learned lower appellate court interalia considered that as per complainant, accused was badly in need of money for his business, but accused has stated on oath that he is an employee of Tata Commins and he has also said in his statement recorded u/s 313 Cr.PC that he is service man.  It has also been considered that as per complainant, he and accused were well-known to each other and for that, reliance was placed that the address of accused mentioned in complaint petition has not been disputed, but on the other hand, the case of accused on oath is that he had lost cheque book, bank pass-book and other documents related to Tata Motor Finance (in which his address was mentioned) is also not improbable. While considering this point the learned lower appellate court found that neither in the complaint, nor in the evidence, complainant has disclosed the date of giving loan, while the date of giving of post-dated cheque has been mentioned as 06-05-08 and also considered that the accused had taken defence by way of suggestion as well as by deposing evidence on oath that he had lost cheque book, Bank Pass-Book and other documents related to Tata Motor Finance for which he had given information to police station as well as the concerned bank on 08-05-2008 and took receipt of both document duly stamped by police station and concerned bank (Exhibit A and B). While considering this point the learned lower appellate court considered that naturally, if a blank cheque is stolen, then it was for the accused to take steps, so that it could not be misused. Accused has adduced evidence to the effect that he had lost cheque book, Bank Pass-Book and other documents related to Tata Motor Finance for which he had given information to police station as well as concerned bank on 08-05-2008 and took receipt of both documents duly stamped by police station and concerned bank (Exhibit A and B).  It was also recorded that on the perusal of cheque in question as well as cheque-return-memo (and on admission of Complainant during cross-examination para 5) the court found that both complainant and accused were maintaining their accounts in same branch of Bank and during cross-examination complainant had admitted that he uses to go toward Govindpur, while D.W.1 and D.W.2 have consistently deposed that the cheque book, Bank Pass-Book and other documents related to Tata Motor Finance were lost in between the house of accused and Govindpur More. The learned lower appellate court found that it is admitted by accused that he had put his signature on the blank cheque, which was lost and hence found it is necessary to compare the handwriting of other entries filled up on cheque with the admitted signature of accused on the strength of Section 73 of Indian Evidence Act.  On comparison, the court found that the handwriting of other entries were entirely different from the signature on bare eyes and that the capital words only are used to write the name of payee with over-writing, while amount has been written by using small letters also. Further, the hand writing of digits showing account number also apparently differed from the digits showing amount as well as date filled up on cheque. The appellate court was of the view that this alone finding confirmed that the case of accused was more probable.\n**Argument by Petitioner**: The learned counsel for the petitioner (complainant) submits that as per the case of the complainant, the accused had taken a friendly loan of Rs. 2,00,000/- which was returned to the complainant by issuing an account payee cheque dated 06.05.2008 drawn on S.B.I. Telco Branch, Jamshedpur and at the time of handing over the cheque, the accused had assured him that the cheque will be honoured on presentation on or before 22.05.2008. The further case of the complainant was that the said cheque was presented on 22.05.2008 and he received a memorandum from his banker on 28.05.2008 that the cheque was dishonoured on the ground of insufficient funds as well as on the ground that the signature occurring on the cheque materially differs with that of the signature of the accused. A legal notice dated 18.06.2008 was issued to the accused who was said to have received the same and in spite of that he neither paid the cheque amount nor responded to the legal notice. It was the case of the complainant that the accused, with fraudulent intention, had put the signature on the cheque in such a manner that it may differ with the specimen signature card of the bank. he learned counsel submits that after considering the materials on record, the learned trial court convicted the accused by a well-reasoned judgment. He submits that the learned trial court had considered the defence which was led by the accused and had based its finding on the fact that the accused has nowhere denied his signature over the cheque during the evidence produced from the side of the complainant or by himself. The learned counsel for the complainant submits that when there was no denial of signature on the cheque from the side of the accused, there was clear statutory presumption in favour of the petitioner and considering this aspect of the matter, the learned trial court had rightly convicted the accused. The learned counsel for the complainant submits that the learned lower appellate court while reversing the judgment passed by the learned trial court had compared the signature instead of taking the help of handwriting expert.  The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (1997) 7 SCC 110 to submit that so far as the signature is concerned, it should have been left for the expert to give an opinion. He submits that the learned lower appellate court was not justified by comparing the signature by its own eyes and ultimately acquitting the accused in the appeal. He further submits that the judgment passed by the learned lower appellate court is ex-facie perverse and accordingly the same is fit to be set-aside on account of the aforesaid point.\n**Argument by Respondent**: The learned counsel appearing on behalf of accused, on the other hand, opposes the prayer and submits that it was the specific case of the complainant that the signature on the cheque \"materially differed\" and accordingly there is no question of any admission on the part of the accused, so far as the signature on the cheque is concerned. He also submits that the complainant had made out a case that the accused is a businessman and for the purposes of doing his business, the accused had taken some loan from the complainant, but it has come in the evidence of accused that he is in service and working in a company namely Tata Cummins. The accused had also stated that the cheque is dated 06.05.2008 and an information was given to the bank on 08.05.2008 that the accused had lost the cheque book, pass book and certain documents on 07.05.2008 and a request was made to the bank to close the account and an information was also given to the police. The learned counsel further submits that it has been mentioned in the said communication that the cheque book was signed, that by itself does not indicate any admission on the part of the accused that the cheque which was presented before the bank was signed by the accused. The learned counsel for the accused has submitted that inspite of aforesaid, the learned courts below have considered the presumption under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and tested the defence of the accused on the principles of 'preponderance of probabilities'. The learned lower appellate court acquitted the accused after considering the entire materials on record. He submits that the impugned judgment of the learned lower appellate court does not call for any interference as the same is a well-reasoned order and a number of reasons have been given by the learned lower appellate court for holding that the accused had rebutted the presumption under section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.  He further submits that comparison of writing on the cheque by the court was only one of the aspects of the matter. Otherwise also there is no complete bar on the court to compare the signature/writing and in the present case, the cheque return memo itself mentioned that the signature materially differed. The learned counsel has relied upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (2019) 5 SCC 418 and submits that the manner in which the defence of the accused in a case under section 138 Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is to be considered has been elaborately dealt with in the said judgment.\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**: The cheque involved in this case is dated 06.05.2008. It is the specific case of the complainant that he had given a friendly loan of Rs. 2,00,000/- for business to the accused who is a businessman and the accused had returned the same vide the said cheque. The date on which the loan was advanced by the complainant has neither been mentioned in the complaint petition nor has come during evidence.  The cheque was dishonoured upon presentation on 28.05.2008 not only on the account of insufficient balance, but also on account that signature differed from the specimen signature card in the bank. The specific case of the petitioner before the learned trial court was that the signature did not tally as the accused purposely did not put his signature properly. Thus, from the side of the complainant himself, it was not in dispute that the signature on the cheque did not tally. It was the case of the complainant that the complainant had given Rs. 2 lakhs to the accused as friendly loan without interest as he was badly in need of money for investing the same in his business.  The defence had examined two witnesses; one was D.W.- 1 who is the maternal uncle of the accused and other is the accused himself. D.W.-1 deposed that on 07.05.2008, while he was going with the accused by motorcycle and when they reached near turning of Govindpur, the accused informed him that one polythene bag containing his cheque book, bank pass book and other documents related to Tata Motor Finance fell down somewhere in the way and thereafter a hectic search was made, but the said documents could not be traced and thereafter, an information was given in the police station. The evidence of the accused was that he did not know the complainant and also stated that while he was going with D.W.-1 by motorcycle from his house to the office of Tata Motor Finance and when they reached near turning of Govindpur, he noticed that the polythene bag containing the cheque book, bank pass book and other documents relating to Tata Motor Finance fell down somewhere on the way and thereafter search was made out, but the said documents could not be traced. He has also deposed that a written information in his pen and signature was given in Govindpur Police Station on 08.05.2008 by him and he obtained a receipt of the same on its carbon copy in signature and seal of the concerned police station and on the same day, he had written information in his bank about missing of cheque and obtained its receiving in signature and seal of the bank and his account was closed. During cross-examination, he has stated that he had requested to close account in his application submitted to the bank and was informed that his account would be closed. . The learned trial court referred to Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and recorded that the court has to presume that the cheque has been received by drawee for discharge of debt or other liability and such presumption is rebuttable and it is primarily the accused who has to establish that the cheque was not issued towards discharge of any debt or other liability.  The learned trial court also recorded that the accused has stated during his statement under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. that neither he issued any cheque in favour of complainant nor he received any notice. The learned trial court also noticed that the complainant during his cross-examination stated that he carries on transport business in partnership and that the accused had given him the cheque at his residence and had also signed the cheque in his presence and the complainant denied the suggestion that he found the lost cheque of the accused and thereafter misused the same and thereafter he knew the accused for the first time in court. The complainant has also stated that he cannot say who had put the signature on the acknowledgement card.  The learned trial court while dealing with the defence of the accused recorded that there were two reasons for dishonour of cheque; one was insufficient fund and another was the signature differed. The learned trial court also took into consideration that the cheque was dishonoured on 28.05.2008 i.e. much after information was given to the bank and that the account was not closed. The learned trial court has also recorded that the other reason given over the return memo is drawer's signature differs and the accused made this another issue in his defence and upon perusal of Ext.-B, it showed that the accused had written therein that he lost signed cheque and accordingly, the learned trial court held that the signature of the accused over the cheque cannot be stated to be in dispute. The learned trial court while deciding the case also observed that the accused has nowhere denied his signature over the cheque during the complete evidence produced from the side of complainant or himself and that it cannot be presumed from a reasonable prudent mind that a man can keep his signed blank cheque and moves here and there and even if a man does so he must be ready to face the peril and that it was duty of the accused to call upon the bank official in his defence in order to show that in which circumstances, the account was not closed and the cheque was dishonoured due to insufficient fund in spite of his instructions to close the account. . So far as service of cheque bouncing notice upon the accused is concerned, the learned trial court held that the complainant had duly proved the carbon copy of notice which is addressed to the accused and the particulars given in notice on postal receipt, acknowledgement card and the complaint are identical and recorded that it is true that the complainant had stated during evidence that he cannot say who had put the signature over the acknowledgement card at the place of addressee, but at the same time, the accused had not denied or challenge the address given over the acknowledgement card as well as the other documents produced by the complainant and that the accused during his statement under Section 313 Cr.P.C. had also given the same address.  Thus, decided this point against the accused. (A) On the point whether accused is stranger to complainant. (B) On the point of friendly loan; (C) Step taken by accused (D) The point regarding writing on the cheque This Court finds that the learned lower appellate court took into consideration that he had lost cheque book, bank pass book and other documents relating to Tata Motor Finance (in which his address was mentioned) is also not improbable. The learned lower appellate court upon comparison of writing on the cheque also found that the hand-writing and the other entries are entirely different from the signature on bare eyes and was of the view that case of the accused was more probable and considering the various circumstances of the case held that the accused had discharged his reverse onus to rebut the presumption under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as per the standard of proof required on the basis of preponderance of probabilities and the complainant miserably failed to prove his case as a matter of fact after rebuttal of the statutory presumption under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and hence failed to prove the case against the accused beyond all reasonable doubts. This Court finds that the learned lower appellate court has dealt with every reason assigned by the learned trial court while dealing with the discharge of onus by the accused in connection with presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and held that it cannot be said that the view taken by the learned trial court is a plausible view for passing the order of conviction and accordingly the judgment of conviction as well as the sentence passed against the accused was set-aside.  This Court finds that the learned lower appellate court had given number of reasons by holding that the accused has discharged his onus on the basis of preponderance of probabilities and the learned counsel for the petitioner while advancing his argument has assailed only one of the reasons by stating that the learned lower appellate court should not have entered into comparison of signature and the same was essentially in the domain of an expert and for that purpose he has relied upon a judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in (1997) 7 SCC 110 and has referred to Paras 37 and 38, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under: This Court finds that there is no complete bar in the power of the court to compare the disputed writing with the admitted writing and it has been held in Para-38 of the aforesaid judgment itself that this power is clearly available to the court under Section 73 of the Evidence Act. In the present case, as per the complainant himself, the signature in the cheque differed and the learned lower appellate court had made certain observations with regard to writings on the cheque itself while examining the case of the accused on the principles of 'preponderance of probabilities'. This Court finds that one of the reasons assigned by the learned appellate court for taking the view was by commenting and comparing the various entries made in the cheque. It is not in dispute that as per the case of the complainant himself, the cheque had bounced due to both the reasons i.e. insufficient funds and signature differed and it was the specific case of the complainant that the accused had made his signature on the cheque in such a manner that it would differ. It was argued by the accused that the very fact that the cheque was dishonoured due to difference in signature itself shows that the cheque was never issued by the accused.  However, the learned trial court proceeded with the matter considering the presumption under Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as the accused had taken a defence that the signed cheque book was lost along with other aforesaid documents and the learned appellate court proceeded by stating that it was an admitted fact that the accused had signed on the blank cheque and compared the hand writing of other entries in the cheque and found as follows:- (a) the handwriting of other entries was entirely different from the signature on bare eyes\\n\\n(b) The capital words only are used to write the name of payee with over-writing, while amount has been written by using small letters also.\\n\\n(c) The hand writing of digits showing account number also apparently differ from the digits showing amount as well as date filled up on cheque. This Court is of the considered view that the learned lower appellate court has not done any illegality in making such comparison of signature/writings on the cheque. The judgment relied upon by the complainant (petitioner) does not help him in any manner whatsoever.  This Court finds that irrespective of the fact that the cheque was signed by the accused or not the learned appellate court has given four different cogent reasons to hold that the accused had rebutted the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 on the standard of proof applying the principles of 'preponderance of probabilities'. This Court finds that in the instant case, admittedly the cheque had bounced due to insufficient funds and that the signature on the cheque did not match with the specimen signature of the accused in the bank. The specific case of the complainant was that the accused had put his signature in such a manner that the same may not match.  The accused led evidence to the effect that the signed cheque book, bank pass book and other documents relating to Tata Motor Finance were lost for which necessary steps were taken and that neither the accused was a businessman nor the accused knew the complainant and that the accused was in fact working in Tata Cummins. Both the learned courts below examined the case from the point as to whether the accused discharged his onus and rebutted the presumption under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1981 by raising a probable defence by applying the principles of 'preponderance of probabilities'. One of the main reasons assigned by the learned trial court while considering the discharge of onus by the accused was that if the accused and the complainant were strangers, then how could the complainant get the address of the accused for the purposes of issuance of notice and that the address is not disputed by the accused. This Court further finds that the learned lower appellate court also considered the defence of the accused that the signed cheque book and other documents relating to Tata Motor Finance and thus the address of the accused was available to complainant for the purposes of issuance of legal notice.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe main issue of the case revolves around the validity of the conviction of the petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The lower court affirmed the petitioner's conviction and sentence based on the allegation that a cheque issued by the petitioner to the complainant bounced due to insufficient funds, and a legal notice was sent followed by the filing of a complaint case within the prescribed time limit.\n\nThe petitioner's argument is based on the contention that the complaint case was filed prematurely, as the legal notice was sent on 16th January 2003, and the complaint case was filed on 11th February 2003. The petitioner argues that 30 days from the date of the legal notice would expire on or about 15th February 2003, and a further 15 days would be required for the accused to pay the cheque amount. Therefore, the petitioner argues that the complaint case was filed prematurely.\n\nOn the other hand, the respondent does not dispute the facts that the legal notice was sent on 16th January 2003 and the complaint case was filed on 11th February 2003. However, it is argued that there is no evidence or averment regarding the service of the legal notice or what happened to the legal notice.\n\nThe lower court's judgment is based on the presumption created under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, that the cheque was issued for payment of a legally enforceable debt or other liability. The court found that the ingredients of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act were present, as the cheque was issued for payment of a debt, the cheque was dishonoured due to insufficient funds, and a legal notice was sent followed by the filing of a complaint case within the prescribed time limit.\n\nHowever, the lower court's decision is flawed due to the absence of evidence regarding the service of the legal notice or what happened to the legal notice. The petitioner's argument holds merit, as the complaint case was filed prematurely.\n\nIn the light of the above analysis, the appeal should be allowed, and the conviction and sentence of the petitioner under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act should be set aside."

Heard Mr. Shailesh Kumar Sinha, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party- State. Heard Mr. Manish Kumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no.2. This criminal revision application has been filed against the judgment dated 03.09.2013 passed in Criminal Appeal No.87 of 2013 by learned court of Principal Sessions Judge, East Singhbhum, Jamshedpur whereby the appellate court has been pleased to set aside the judgment of acquittal of the petitioner dated 23.01.2013 passed by learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jamshedpur in Complaint C/1 Case No.3444 of 2010 and convicted the petitioner for offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as the Act of 1881) and directed the learned trial court to pass an order of sentence after giving an opportunity of hearing to both the sides. The matter was taken up by this Court on 26.11.2020 and the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite party no.2 had submitted that pursuant to the appellate order, the petitioner did not appear before the learned trial court and therefore the matter is still pending for passing an order of sentence against the petitioner. Arguments on behalf of the Petitioner\nArgument by the Petitioner:\n Learned Amicus appearing on behalf of the petitioner has submitted that in the judgements passed by both the courts below no finding has been recorded with regards to service of statutory notice regarding bouncing of cheque upon the petitioner, although finding has been recorded with regards to dispatch of legal notice through registered cover. She submits that the petitioner had denied service of notice regarding bouncing of the cheque.  She submits that it was for the prosecution to prove service of statutory notice which is a condition precedent for filing a case under section 138 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 and even if deemed service of notice sent under registered cover is taken into consideration, the complaint itself was pre-mature as it was filed prior to expiry of the statutory time line.  The other point involved in the present case is whether the learned appellate court was justified in setting aside the trial court's judgment of acquittal of the petitioner. She submits that the judgment of acquittal passed by the learned trial court was certainly one of the possible views; there was no illegality or perversity in the judgment of acquittal passed by the learned trial court calling for interference by the learned appellate court; the appellate court did not record any perversity in the judgment of acquittal passed by the learned trial court. She submits that the manner in which the learned appellate court has exercised the appellate jurisdiction in the matter of setting aside the judgment of acquittal by the learned trial court calls for interference in revisional jurisdiction of this Court in order to meet the ends of justice. Arguments on behalf of the opposite parties Before the trial court, the argument of the counsel for the accused- petitioner was that the amount taken by the petitioner was returned in instalments and a receipt (Exhibit-A) was also issued by the complainant. It was also the case of the accused petitioner that the complainant withheld the cheque in spite of receiving the cheque amount as the cheque was missing and traceless in the hands of the complainant.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n7. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite parties have submitted that the impugned judgment of setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the learned trial court is legal and valid in view of the fact that the learned trial court did not appreciate the legal presumption under section 139 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 in connection with the issuance and bouncing of cheque.  He submits that the learned appellate court after considering the evidences on record found that the defence failed to establish the genuineness of Exhibit A through which it was claimed that the entire amount has been refunded to the complainant and was of the view that all the requirements to establish a case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act were fully satisfied by the complainant. The learned counsel for the opposite party has also relied upon a judgement passed by the Hon'ble Supreme court in Cr. Appeal No.271 of 2020:AIR 2020 SC 945 with analogous case (APS Forex Services Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Shakti International Fashion Liners and Ors.) decided on 14.02.2020, para 5.2 on the point of presumption under Section 139 of aforesaid Act of 1881 and its rebuttal. Findings of this Court On the other hand, the counsel for the complainant argued that the letter pad of M/s Lalie Automobile Services Engineering was kept with the accused with signature of the complainant and the accused used the blank letter pad in his favour to mislead the court and questioned Exhibit-A\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe trial court recorded that the counsel for the complainant had not denied the genuineness of the signature of the complainant on Exhibit-A. The learned trial court, interalia, considered Exhibit-A and held that the contentions of the complainant as well as the petitioner is supported with documents and the prosecution case had become doubtful. The trial court held that a doubt was created in the prosecution case and accordingly, the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubts and acquitted the accused - petitioner. The learned trial court also held that it was for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and as reasonable doubt was created, the prosecution was held to have failed in discharging the burden. The learned trial court neither referred to Section 139 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 nor considered the effect of legal presumption under Section 139 nor examined the discharge of burden of proof on the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\" as crystalised by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rohitbhai Jivanlal Patel v. State of Gujarat, (2019) 18 SCC 106 and also in Cr. Appeal No.271 of 2020 with analogous case (APS Forex Services Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Shakti International Fashion Liners and Ors.) decided on 14.02.2020.  The appellate court, after considering the materials on record, was of the view that the defence failed to establish the genuineness of Exhibit-A and held that all the requirements to establish a case under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act were fulfilled by the complainant.  The learned appellate court also recorded that the learned trial court failed to appreciate that the materials which were brought on record by the complainant were sufficient to establish the case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and was of the view that the prosecution has been able to prove the case beyond all shadow of reasonable doubts and set-aside the judgement of acquittal of the petitioner passed by the learned trial court. . Thus, on the one hand, the learned trial court, interalia, considered Exhibit- A and held that the case of the complainant as well as the accused was based on documentary evidences and accordingly, the case against the accused had become doubtful. On the other hand, the learned appellate court was of the view that the defence failed to establish the genuineness of Exhibit- A and recorded that the basic ingredients for offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act were fulfilled.  However, both the learned courts below have not examined the evidences on record in the light of statutory presumption under Section 139 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 and also failed to apply the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\" in the matter of rebuttal of the statutory presumption under Section 139 of the aforesaid Act of 1881.\n",
    "Case_Result": "Before dealing with the facts of the case and the impugned judgement, it would be proper to deal with the legal position with regards to the scope of power of the appellate court dealing with appeal against acquittal; presumption under Section 139 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 in connection with issuance and bouncing of the cheque and statutory time line in connection with filing of case for offence under Section 138 of the aforesaid Act of 1881. Section 118 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 deals with presumption as to negotiable instruments and Section 139, provides that it shall be presumed, unless contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque, of the nature referred to in Section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability.The present revision having been filed against judgement of appellate court, reversing the judgement of acquittal of the petitioner by the trial court for offence under Section 138 of the aforesaid Act of 1881, this case is also to be decided posing the same two questions as mentioned above.It is not in dispute that the complainant and the accused are relative of each other and they were partners of a partnership firm. The sequence of events in connection with bouncing of the cheque are as follows: - August, 2009 -The petitioner demanded friendly loan of Rs. 5 lacs from the complainant with a promise to return the amount within six or seven months. The amount was borrowed by the petitioner for treatment of his wife. Till 1 February, 2010 - The petitioner received altogether Rs.4,14,966/-. 01.02.2010 - Petitioner issued a cheque amounting to Rs. 4,14,966/- in favour of the complainant- Exhibit-1 20.03.2010- The petitioner promised that as soon as his loan will be sanctioned, he would return the amount and the complainant may not be required to produce the cheque before the bank. 31.03.2010 -The petitioner did not pay the loan amount to the complainant till 30.03.2010 and ultimately the complainant produced the cheque on 31.03.2010 before the bank which was dishonoured due to \"insufficient fund\"- Exhibit-2. 07.04.2010- Cheque return memo was issued on 07.04.2010- Exhibit-3. 31.08.2010- The complainant informed the petitioner and the petitioner assured him to wait till 31.08.2010. 15.09.2010 - Again, the petitioner told him to wait till 15.09.2010. 18.09.2010 - The complainant presented the cheque Exhibit - 2/A 21.09.2010- The Cheque return memo was issued on 21.09.2010 regarding dishonour of cheque- Exhibit-3/A. 27.09.2010 - The complainant issued a legal notice on 27.09.2010 (Exhibit-4) through his Advocate for payment of Rs. 4,14,966/- through registered post with A/D dated 27.09.2010 - Exhibit-5. There is no evidence on record regarding service of legal notice upon the petitioner, much less the date of service of notice. 04.11.2010- The complaint case was filed against the petitioner by the complainant on 04.11.2010. At the stage of trial, the complainant was the sole witness and has supported the prosecution case. The complainant exhibited the aforesaid documents. However, there was no evidence regarding service of legal notice dated 27.09.2010 upon the petitioner sent through registered post with A/D dated 27.09.2010, much less the date of service of notice.The complainant was fully cross examined. She deposed that she was the partner of M/s Lalie Automobile Servicing Engineering and presently she was the proprietor of the said firm and earlier she was the partner of firm namely Dhupeswar Enterprises of the petitioner.The petitioner entered into the defence and produced himself as defence witness. He also deposed that the complainant was the partner of his firm namely M/s Lalie Automobile Services Engineering and the complainant is also his sister-in-law. He deposed that a dispute arose between them and for its peaceful settlement, he issued the cheque in favour of the complainant and the complainant had agreed that when the cheque amount would be paid to her in cash, she would return the cheque to the petitioner. The petitioner deposed that he had paid the cheque amount of Rs.4,14,699/- to the complainant in three instalments and the last instalment was given on 06.09.2010 amounting to Rs.1,14,699/- and requested the complainant to return the cheque, but the complainant told him that the cheque has been kept somewhere and she was unable to return the same. Accordingly, the complainant issued a receipt dated 06.09.2010 in which it was assured that she would return the cheque when it would be traced out. The receipt dated 06.09.2010 was typed in letter head of M/s Lalie Automobile Service Engineering containing the signature of the complainant with the seal of the company. This document was marked as Ext. A with objection.The accused who deposed as defence witness was fully cross- examined from the side of the prosecution and during his cross examination, he deposed that his wife has been suffering from illness for 3 years and he took loan from the complainant amounting to Rs.4,14,699/- for treatment of his wife. He gave account payee cheque to the complainant amounting to Rs.4,14,699/- but he did not receive any legal notice. The petitioner also deposed that he obtained bail from the court after receiving notice of the court. The accused had stated before the court as witness that he had already returned loan amount to the complainant.He also deposed that there is another firm namely Dhupeswar Enterprises in which the complainant was the partner and now, he was the proprietor of this firm. Point no. (a) whether the complainant had established the ingredients of Sections 118 and 139 of the NI Act so as to justify drawing of the presumption envisaged therein?21. This Court also finds that the petitioner had taken a specific plea that he did not receive any legal notice and he obtained bail from the court after receiving notice from the court. Admittedly, the legal notice in connection with the cheque was sent to the petitioner on 27.09.2010 by registered post with A/D. There is no evidence regarding service of legal notice upon the petitioner, much less the date of service of notice. It has been simply alleged that the petitioner did not pay the cheque amount in spite of service of notice.There is no finding recorded by the learned courts below regarding service of legal notice upon the petitioner, much less the date of receipt of legal notice by the petitioner although the petitioner had specifically denied receipt of the legal notice. This Court finds that the Complainant mentioned the cause of action in the complaint from 31.03.2010, 17.04.2010, 21.09.2010 (date of cheque return memo) and continuing till the date of filing of the complaint case, filed on 04.11.2010.24. This Court is of the considered view that date of service of notice of cheque bouncing is a material date for the purposes of calculation of time line giving a cause of action for filing a complaint case under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. It is for the Complainant to prove that the cause of action arose as per the provisions of Section 138 proviso (c) of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, which clearly provides that the cause of action arises upon expiry of 15 days from the date of receipt of cheque bouncing notice. In absence of the relevant date regarding service of cheque bouncing notice, the finding of the learned appellate court that the materials brought by the complaint was sufficient to establish the case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, is perverse, and cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. This Court finds that even the learned trial court did not record any finding regarding the date of service of legal notice upon the petitioner, but had acquitted the petitioner on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove the case against the petitioner beyond reasonable doubts.There is no provision under the said provisions of aforesaid Act of 1881 to calculate the cause of action to file the case under Section 138 from the date of issuance of legal notice and there is no provision enabling curtailment of statutory period of 15 days given for making payment upon expiry of 15 days from service of notice of cheque bouncing. In that view of the matter, the finding of the learned lower appellate court that the materials brought on record by the prosecution were sufficient to convict the petitioner for offence under Section 138 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 is ex- facie perverse and is accordingly set aside. Consequently, the condition precedent for filing the case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, having not been satisfied, the complaint itself was not maintainable on the day it was filed and accordingly, the petitioners could not have been convicted under the said Section. The question of any presumption regarding existing debt under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 did not arise as the complaint itself was not maintainable. Accordingly, the conviction of the petitioner under Section 138 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 by the learned appellate court cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. Having decided point no. (a) as aforesaid, there may not be any need to enter into point no. (b).5. However, this Court finds it proper to touch upon issue no. (b) also as the learned trial court had acquitted the petitioner and the learned appellate court had set-aside the judgement of acquittal which is the impugned judgement before this Court. An argument was raised before the learned trial court that the examination - in - chief of the accused- petitioner as witness could not be filed on affidavit. The learned trial court recorded that, the evidence of the accused was filed on affidavit and the counsel for the complainant had cross-examined him at length and accordingly, the objection raised on behalf of the complainant in connection with recording of evidence of the accused under Section 315 of Cr.P.C. by way of examination-in-chief on affidavit, was rejected.The issuance of cheque is not in dispute.This Court finds that the learned appellate court, while deciding the appeal, framed the question as to whether the appellant had proved the charge against the accused beyond all shadow of reasonable doubt and whether the judgement passed by learned trial court needed any interference. The learned appellate court also neither referred to Section 139 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 nor considered the presumption under Section 139 nor examined the discharge of burden of proof on the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\" as crystalised by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgements.There is no doubt that mere denial of existing debt or discharge of debt may not be sufficient to discharge the burden of proof from the side of the accused on the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\", but, once the accused puts on record further material, the onus of the accused stands discharged on the principle of \"preponderance of probabilities\".In such a scenario, the test of proportionality should guide the construction and interpretation of reverse onus and the accused is not expected to discharge an unduly high standard or proof and the accused need not discharge his burden to the extent of being beyond all reasonable doubt. Once a probable defence is put on record from the side of the accused, the onus shifts upon the complainant to prove the fact regarding existing debt.In the instant case, the Exhibit- A is dated 06.09.2010 which is certainly after first instance of bouncing of cheque and prior to presentation of cheque second time, upon which legal notice was issued and case was filed. This Court has scrutinised the materials on record as the Exhibit A was relied upon by the learned trial court but disbelieved by the learned appellate court. Upon perusal of the records, this Court finds that there is no material on record, either in the evidence in chief of the complainant or evidence in chief of the accused or even in their cross examination, that the blank signed pages were signed and handed over by the complainant to the accused - petitioner in connection with the partnership firm and that the same has been misused by the accused- petitioner to create a document of receipt of the cheque amount i.e Exhibit-A. In the cross examination of the complainant, she had denied receipt of the cheque amount and denied issuance of any money receipt but had not mentioned regarding any signed blank page handed over to the accused- petitioner or retained by the accused-petitioner which could have been misused by the accused petitioner. t further appears that the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the complainant regarding signed blank page retained by the accused -petitioner and its misuse, was not based on any material on record. There is no explanation on record from the side of the complainant in connection with Exhibit-A and the accused-petitioner, the sole defence witness, was neither cross-examined on this point nor any suggestion was put to him alleging that Exhibit A was prepared by misusing blank page signed by the complainant. This Court finds that the learned appellate court rejected the genuineness of Exhibit- A by applying the principle of strict proof and did not examine Exhibit-A in the light of the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\". This Court is of the considered view that the defence taken by the petitioner on the basis of Exhibit-A that the entire cheque amount was returned by the petitioner to the complainant was certainly a probable defence when seen in the light of the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\" and the appellate court erred in law in rejecting the defence of the petitioner and not considering the case on the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\".

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9ac4\n**Facts**:  The complainant/applicant has filed this criminal miscellaneous application under Section 378(4)Cr.P.C. against Ramesh Kumar son of Rulia Ram for grant of leave to appeal against the impugned judgment dated 4.10.2014 passed by learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Karnal, vide which the complaint filed under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') has been dismissed and the accused has been acquitted of the charges as framed against him. 4. Cr. Misc. No.A-1741-MA of 2014 [3] The complainant examined himself as CW-1 and Arun Sharma as CW-2 and closed his evidence.  At the close of complainant's evidence, accused was examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C. and he was confronted with the evidence of the complainant, but he denied the correctness of the same and pleaded himself as innocent. The accused also examined himself as DW-1 and stated that he had handed over the cheque in question as security cheque to Arun Sharma in the year 2004-05. He also tendered statement of account for the period from 19.2.2005 to 31.3.2013 Mark-DX and closed his evidence. Aggrieved from the said judgment, the present appeal along with application seeking leave to file appeal has been filed by the complainant.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  The learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Karnal, vide impugned judgment dated 4.10.2014 after appreciating the evidence acquitted the accused.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  It has been mainly submitted in the application that the applicant is filing the accompanying criminal appeal against the judgment of acquittal which is likely to succeed as per grounds mentioned therein. It has been stated that the learned trial Court has wrongly and illegally disbelieved Cr. Misc. No.A-1741-MA of 2014 [2] the evidence led by the applicant/complainant though the applicant has completely proved his case against the respondent.  The trial Court while passing the impugned judgment of acquittal has totally ignored the settled proposition of law that the provisions of Section 138 of the NI Act do not run counter to the basic principles of criminal law that an accused must be presumed to be innocent.  That the conclusions drawn by the learned Magistrate while acquitting the respondent are contrary to law. The learned Magistrate has misread and misconstrued the valuable evidence on the record and resultantly arrived at grossly unjust conclusions.  The reasoning given is wholly erroneous and unsound. It has been stated that a perusal of the impugned judgment, prima facie, shows that the same suffers from material irregularity and illegalities. It has also been stated that the reasons given by the learned Magistrate are based upon surmises and conjectures. The various circumstances draw irresistible inference against the respondent. It has, therefore, been prayed that this application be allowed and leave be granted to the applicant to file appeal.\n**Argument by Respondent**:  As per the averments made in the complaint, the accused borrowed an amount of Rs. 2,50,000/- as a friendly loan from the complainant with an assurance to repay the same within a period of one year. In discharge of this liability, the accused issued a cheque bearing No.001164 dated 17.3.2011 for Rs. 2,50,000/- in favour of the complainant.  On presentation of this cheque for enactment, the same was returned back with the remarks \"Account closed\". Legal notice was given. When the amount was not paid within the statutory period, the complaint was filed\n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved . Section 138: Dishonour of cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account .  No court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 138 except upon a complaint, in writing, made by the payee or, as the case may be, the holder in due course of the cheque . No court inferior to that of a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Judicial Magistrate of the first class shall try any offence .  All subsequent complaints arising out of section 138 against the same drawer shall be filed before the same court irrespective of 1 section 138 . (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2), where the payee or the holder in due course, as the case may be, has filed a complaint against the drawer of a cheque in the court having jurisdiction under section 142 .  The amount of fine imposed under section 138 or the amount of compensation awarded under section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) shall be reduced by the amount paid or recovered as interim compensation under this section 144 Mode of service of summons . Magistrate issuing a summons to an accused or a witness may direct a copy of summons to be served at the place where such accused or witness ordinarily resides or carries on business .\n**Analysis**:  I have heard learned counsel for the applicant and have gone through the record. From the record, I find that the findings given by the trial Court, in no way, can be held as perverse. Nothing has been pointed out as to how the findings are perverse. Nothing has been pointed out as to which material evidence has been misread by the Court below and as to which material evidence has not been considered by the Court below. There is nothing on the record to show that the findings are against the evidence or law.  A perusal of the record further shows that there is no document Cr. Misc. No.A-1741-MA of 2014 [4] on the record to show the loan transaction. The defence of the accused is that he used to sell the crops to one Arun Sharma, Commission Agent, who was also very well known to the complainant. The accused stopped selling crop through Arun Sharma and he handed over the cheque in question, which was blank as security cheque, to the complainant who misused the same and filed a false complaint. A perusal of the evidence on record shows that this cheque was filled in the hand of Arun Sharma, Commission Agent, which fact has been admitted by the complainant. Further, the complainant neither in the complaint nor in the affidavit has mentioned the fact that he borrowed an amount of Rs. 1,20,000/- from Arun Sharma to lend the same to the accused. On the contrary, Arun Sharma CW-2 deposed in cross-examination that an amount of Rs. 1,20,000/- was given by him to the complainant in order to lend the same to the accused.  Arun Sharma had also deposed that his Munim had made a due entry of lending Rs. 1,20,000/- to the complainant in books of account. Accordingly, the trial Court was of the view that once the accused had denied the factum of borrowing Rs. 2,50,000/- from the complainant, it was incumbent from the complainant to furnish books of account maintained by Arun Sharma to prove on record that Rs. 1,20,000/- was given by Arun Sharma to lend the same to the accused, but no such record has been produced. The complainant also stated that he started knowing accused from the shop of Arun Sharma as he and accused used to sell their respective agricultural produce through him. Except this, he had no knowledge about the accused or his family members.\n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The main issue of the case is whether the lower court correctly applied the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act while ruling on the appeal against the acquittal of the petitioner for offence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The lower court erred in its judgment by not examining the evidences on record in the light of statutory presumption under Section 139 of the aforesaid Act of 1881 and also failed to apply the principles of \"preponderance of probabilities\" in the matter of rebuttal of the statutory presumption under Section 139 of the aforesaid Act of 1881. The appeal should be allowed."

The applicant issued a cheque dated 29.11.2018 bearing no.088494 amounting to Rs.9,00,000/- drawn on Axis Bank, Naranpura Branch in favour of the original complainant and on deposition of the same, the cheque came to be dishonored on 05.12.2019 with notings that 'Account Closed' and the concerned bank informed the original complainant on 15.01.2019 as stated by the complainant.  After issuance of notice, the original complainant instituted Criminal Complaint No.1813 of 2019 for the alleged offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short \"the NI Act\").  The original complainant thereafter instituted Criminal Appeal for enhancement of sentence along with Criminal Misc. Application (stamp) No.8069 of 2020, for Leave to appeal under Section 378 of the Code. 2.4. Subsequent thereto, with the intervention of prestigious people of society and friends and relatives, the applicant and the respondent no.2-original complainant arrived at a settlement/ compromise and the same has also been reduced in writing in form of affidavit filed by original complainant dated 21.12.2020. Subsequently, on 31.03.2021 this Court passed following order: \"It is stated in the affidavit filed by Mr. Pratik JaydevbhaiBarot that he has received the entire amount as agreed between the parties and he does not wish to pursue further and he has no objection if the judgment and order dated th 31.12.2019 passed in Criminal Case No. 1813 of 2019 by the 4 Additional Senior Civil Judge and Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Mehsana is quashed.\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned advocate Dr.Venugopal Patel appearing for the applicant has submitted that the dispute and grievances have been amicably resolved between the parties and in connection whereof, settlement affidavit dated 09.03.2020 has also been executed and the same has also been produced before the High Court in Criminal Misc. Application (stamp) No.8069 of 2020.  Learned advocate Dr.Venugopal Patel has placed reliance on the judgments of the Court in the case of NarottambhaiKarshandas Nanda V/s. State of Gujarat, 2011 (0) GLHEL-HC-224758, in the case of KirpalsinghPratapsingh Ori V/s.

Thus, he submitted that the impugned judgment and order and further proceedings in that regard, may be quashed and set aside.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n Learned advocate Shri Digant Popat appearing for Respondent No.2 supports the submission made by Ld advocate for the applicant and states that the dispute between the parties is resolved amicably.Respondent no.2 has received the outstanding cheque amount from the applicant and the Respondent No.2 does not wish to continue with the proceedings initiated against the applicant and the same be quashed since the dispute does not survive anymore.  Learned APP Ms.NishaThakore is not in a position to controvert the settled legal position and has fairly stated that the application for quashing the complaint with consent be allowed on imposition of appropriate costs. Learned APP Ms. NishaThakore has submitted that since the applicant-accused may avail efficacious remedy by way of filing appeal under Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, the impugned FIR may not be quashed. She has submitted that appropriate cost may impose since the applicant- accused has approached this Court after the order of conclusion was passed. Under the circumstances, let the matter be kept for orders.\"\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nThe learned trial court vide order dated 31.12.2019, convicted the applicant imposing one year Simple Imprisonment and also directed the applicant to pay compensation to the original complainant to the tune of Rs.13,50,000/-, in default to which, further imprisonment of six months was directed. On 09.03.2021, this Court passed the following order:-\\n\\n\"1. Heard Dr.Venugopal Patel, learned advocate for the applicant, Mr.Digant M. Popat, learned advocate for the respondent no.2 and Ms. NishaThakore, learned APP for respondent-State. 2.

He submitted that respondent No. 2 has filed an affidavit in these proceedings and has declared that the dispute between the applicant and respondent No. 2 is resolved and the respondent No. 2 objection if the judgment and order dated 13.12.2019 passed in Criminal Case No. 1813 of 2019 under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is quashed and set aside. 3. Since the applicant is also convicted under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, learned advocates for appearing for both the sides, have relied upon the decisions reported in (2012) 1GDC 387, 2004(2) GLH 544 and (2010) 5 SCC 663 : (AIR 2010 SC 1907). . Stand over to 15.03.2021.\n",
    "Case_Result": "I have heard the learned advocate Dr.Venugopal Patel for the applicant, learned advocate Mr.DigantPopat for respondent no.2 and learned APP Ms.NishaThakore for the respondent- State. So far as CrPC is concerned, Section 320 deals with offences which are compoundable, either by the parties without the leave of the court or by the parties but only with the leave of the court. Sub-section (1) of Section 320 enumerates the offences which are compoundable without the leave of the court, while sub-section (2) of the said section specifies the offences which are coms: undable with the leave of the court. Section 147 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 is in the nature of an enabling provision which provides for the compounding of offences prescribed under the same Act, thereby serving as an exception to the general rule incorporated in sub-section (9) of Section 320 CrPC which states that \"No offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section\", A bare reading of this provision would lead us to the inference that offences punishable under Jaws other than the Penal Code also cannot be compounded, However, since Section 147 was inserted by way of an amendment to a special Jaw, the same will override the effect of Section 320(9) CrPC, especially keeping in mind that Section 147 carries a non obstante clause.This Court by the order dated 24.11.2011 in Criminal Revision Application No.479 of 2011 made the following observations:- On 31.03.2021, the respondent no.2 remained present through video conference and stated that the parties have arrived at a settlement and the entire amount agreed between the parties is received by respondent no.2 and that he has no objection if the conviction of the applicant with respect to the present offence is quashed. He has further stated that there was no coercion, threat or force in entering into the compromise. He has entered into compromise with the applicant by free will. This Court is aware that the ideal remedy for the parties ought to have been to prefer an appeal as available under the law. The guidelines as prescribed in the case of DamodarPrabhu (Supra) also provide for instituting proceedings for compounding the offence before the appellate court as the present proceedings are preferred after an order of conviction by a competent court. Generally the powers available under Section 482 of the Code would not have been exercised when a statutory remedy under the law is available, however considering the peculiar set of facts and circumstances it would not be in the interest of justice to relegate the parties to appellate court. Additionally when both the parties have invoked the jurisdiction of this Court and there is no bar on exercise of powers and the inherent powers of this court can always be invoked for imparting justice and bringing a quietus to the issue between the parties and hence, the present application is entertained.

    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "The key issue in the case is whether the lower court correctly ruled on the applicant's plea for quashing the criminal proceedings initiated under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, after a settlement was reached between the parties. The lower court convicted the applicant and imposed a sentence of one year's simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs.13,50,000, in default of which, further imprisonment of six months was directed. The applicant contended that the dispute was resolved amicably and the impugned judgment and order should be quashed.\n\nThe lower court's judgment is based on the fact that the applicant issued a dishonored cheque and failed to make the payment within 15 days from the date of the dishonor, as required by Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The court held that the applicant's conduct fell under the purview of the offence defined in Section 138 and imposed the prescribed sentence.\n\nHowever, the applicant's argument was supported by the settlement affidavit and the fact that the respondent no. 2 received the outstanding cheque amount from the applicant. The lower court did not consider the settlement and the subsequent payment of the outstanding amount as a sufficient ground to quash the criminal proceedings.\n\nThe relevant sections of the Negotiable Instruments Act, particularly Sections 143 and 144, provide for the quashing of criminal proceedings if satisfactory explanation is given, and if the amount involved is paid back before the commencement of the trial. The legal precedents cited by the applicant, such as NarottambhaiKarshandas Nanda v. State of Gujarat, KirpalsinghPratapsingh Ori v. Salvinder Kaur HardisinghLobana and Anr., Damodar S. Prabhu v. Sayed Babalal H., and various orders passed by the High Court, support the quashing of criminal proceedings under similar circumstances.\n\nConsidering the legal precedents and the settlement reached between the parties, the lower court's judgment appears to be incorrect. The applicant's conviction and sentence should be quashed since the dispute does not survive anymore and the offence defined in Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act is no longer applicable.\n\nBased on the analysis, I allow the appeal and set aside the lower court's judgment and order. The criminal proceedings initiated against the applicant under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act are quashed."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\n1. Present appeal has been filed by the appellant - State under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 challenging the judgment and order dated 27.01.2005, passed in nd Criminal Case No. 2498 of 2000 by the learned 2 Joint Judicial Magistrate First Class, Jamnagar, recording the acquittal 2. The facts, in brief, are that complainant - Hansraj Jadavji Kanani, resident of Taluka: Falla, Dist.: Jamnagar lodged a complaint before the Court that the respondent No. 1 herein had borrowed Rs.1,50,000/- from him for business purpose and to repay the same, he issued a Cheque bearing No. 187953 dated 05.11.1999 drawn on The Commercial Coop. Bank Ltd., Patel Colony Branch, Jamnagar, which, the complainant presented in bank, but the same was returned by the bank with an endorsement \"insufficient fund\" and hence, the complainant issued a legal notice dated 17.11.1999 to the respondent No. 1 through his advocate by RPAD, however, since the respondent No. 1 did not repay the said amount, the complainant was constrained to file complaint before the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate First Class, Jamnagar under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (herein after referred to as \"the NI Act\"). 2.1 Upon such complaint being filed and subsequent service of summons upon the respondent No. 1, he appeared before the Court. Since the accused did not plead guilty, trial was proceeded against him.  Being aggrieved by the same, the appellant - original complainant has preferred the present appeal. 3. Heard, learned advocate Mr. Nirav C. Thakkar for the appellant - original complainant, learned advocate Mr. Premal Rachh for the respondent No. 1 and learned APP Mr. Dharmesh Devnani for the respondent No. 2 - State. 3.1\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nLearned advocate Mr. Thakkar for the appellant - original complainant has mainly contended that the learned trial Judge ought to have convicted the accused inasmuch as issued, cheque in question was duly signed by the respondent No. 1, and came to be dishonoured when presented before the bank for insufficiency of fund. Furthermore, in his submission, the learned trial Judge ought to have appreciated the fact that the cheque was issued for discharge of legal liability towards complainant and not for the security purpose. Further, it is submitted that the learned trial Judge ought to have held that legal notice upon the respondent No. 1 was issued within the stipulated time. Further, the learned advocate has stated that the learned trial Judge ought not to believe the accused that the cheque was misused because if the cheque would not have been returned, the accused would have taken some steps. Further, in his submission, the learned trial Judge ought to have held in view of the evidence on record that the accused had failed to rebut the onus of proof and statutory presumption against him. It is also submitted that for other cheque, the appellant had filed another complaint, wherein, present defence was not taken. 3.2  The learned advocate, taking this Court through the oral as well as the documentary evidence on record, submitted that though the case against the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt, however, the learned trial Judge has not properly appreciated the evidence on record and thereby, has committed an error in recording acquittal and therefore, the impugned judgment and order suffers from material illegality, perversity and contrary to the facts and evidence on record. Accordingly, he urged that present appeal may be allowed by quashing and setting aside the impugned judgment and order of acquittal. That the duty is cast upon the appellate Court, in such circumstances, to re-appreciate the evidence to arrive to just decision on the basis of material placed on record to find out whether the accused is connected with the commission of the crime with which he is charged.\nArgument by the Respondent:\n. Per contra, learned advocate Mr. Premal Rachh for the respondent No. 1 - accused, while supporting the impugned judgment and order of the trial Court, submitted that the learned trial Judge has, after due and proper appreciation and evaluation of the evidence on record, has come to such a conclusion and has acquitted the accused, which is just and proper. He submitted that it is trite law that if two views are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate Court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial Court. Further, while exercising the powers in appeal against the order of acquittal, the Court of appeal would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal unless the approach of the lower Court is vitiated by some manifest illegality. 4.1  The learned advocate for the respondent No. 1 - accused submitted that for invoking the provisions of Section 138 of the NI Act, the debt or other liability means a legally enforceable debt or other liability, which the complainant has failed to prove and accordingly, the learned trial Judge has rightly recorded the acquittal. 4.2 The learned advocate for the respondent No. 1 has heavily submitted that the ingredients of the offence alleged against the accused are not proved beyond reasonable doubt and therefore, the learned trial Judge has rightly acquitted the accused of the charges levelled against him. 4.3 It is submitted that some of the crucial witnesses to the incident in question viz. Karan Parbatbhai Varotariya, Exh. 76 and Tulsibhai Jivrajbhai Patel, Exh. 80 were not examined by the complainant side and it is only the respondent No. 1 who had called upon such witnesses, in whose presence, the cheque was stated to have been demanded to be returned back to the respondent No. 1.  It is submitted that if the case with regard to the land and home, as projected by the respondent No. 1 would not have been there, the transactions related to cancellation of Agreement to Sell qua home and execution of Sale Deed qua the land after issuance of the legal notice about dishonour of cheque, might not be there. 4.4 The learned advocate for the respondent No. 1 - accused further submitted that the learned trial Judge has rightly acquitted the accused as the complainant failed to bring home the charge against the accused. Accordingly, it is requested that no interference is required at the hands of this Court and eventually, it is urged that the present appeal may be dismissed.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nVide impugned judgment and order dated 27.01.2005, the learned trial Judge acquitted the accused person. \n",
    "Case_Result": "Heard the learned advocates for the respective parties and gone through the impugned judgment and order of the trial Court as well as the material on record. Before adverting to the facts of the case, it would be worthwhile to refer to the scope of interference in acquittal appeals. It is well settled by catena of decisions that an appellate Court has full power to review, re- appreciate and consider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded. However, the Appellate Court must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is prejudice in favour of the accused, firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial Court. 5.1 Further, if two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate Court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial Court. Further, while exercising the powers in appeal against the order of acquittal, the Court of appeal would not ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal unless the approach of the lower Court is vitiated by some manifest illegality and the conclusion arrive at would not be arrived at by any reasonable person, and therefore, the decision is to be characterized as perverse. 5.2 5. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that the judgment of the trial court being one of acquittal, the High Court should not have set it aside on mere appreciation of the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution unless it came to the conclusion that the judgment of the trial Judge was perverse. In our opinion, it is not correct to say that unless the appellate court in an appeal under Section 417 Cr.P.C came to the conclusion that the judgment of acquittal under appeal was perverse it could not set aside that order. It has been laid down by this Court that it is open to the High Court on an appeal against an order of acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion, of course, keeping in view the well-established rule that the presumption of innocence of the accused is not weakened but strengthened by the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial court which had the advantage of observing the demeanour of witnesses whose evidence have been recorded in its presence.It is also well settled that the court of appeal has as wide powers of appreciation of evidence in an appeal against an order of acquittal as in the case of an appeal against an order of conviction, subject to the riders that the presumption of innocence with which the accused person starts in the trial court continues even up to the appellate stage and that the appellate court should attach due weight to the opinion of the trial court which recorded the order of acquittal. If the appellate court reviews the evidence, keeping those principles in mind, and comes to a contrary conclusion, the judgment cannot be said to have been vitiated. (See in this connection the very cases cited at the Bar, namely, Surajpal Singh v. State AIR 1952 SC 52; Wilayat Khan v. State of U.P AIR 1953 SC 122)In our opinion, there is no substance in the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that the High Court was not justified in reviewing the entire evidence and coming to its own conclusions. 6.1. Thus, in the case under NI Act, the cheque drawn by a person on an account maintained by him with a banker for payment of any amount of money to another person from out of that account for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability. Further, explanation to this section defines the debt and other liability to mean a legally enforceable debt or other liability.In this context, after due appreciation and evaluation of the evidence on record, the learned trial Judge has come to such a conclusion that the debt cannot be said to be legally enforceable debt and the complainant has failed to prove otherwise. The learned trial Judge has considered the factual position, as is emerges from the evidence on record that the complainant has not resorted to any legal proceedings on not being given the possession of land after the sale deed came to be effected. Further, it has also been observed by the learned trial Judge that when it is an admitted position that the possession of the land itself was not handed over to the complainant, in that event, he ought to have made known the said fact to Tulsibhai, while selling the same to Tulsibhai, however, such is not the case. Accordingly, the learned trial Judge further inferred that there might be some understanding to that effect between the complainant and the accused and accordingly, the land was sold to Tulsibhai. The learned trial Judge further goes to observe that if at all the transactions qua land and the home would have been different, in that case there would not have been any need to cancel the sale deed of home on the same day when the sale deed for the land was executed. Further, it has been observed that the complainant has also failed to explain as to why the complainant had cancelled the sale deed of home. Further, from the appreciation of evidence, the learned trial Judge has disbelieved the story of transfer of the complainant which remained in abeyance and hence, cancellation of sale deed. Further, it is an admitted fact that on the same day i.e. on 13.12.1999, the sale deed qua land came to be executed, whereas, the sale deed qua home was cancelled. Further, the cheque in question was of prior in point of time to the said transactions and legal notice for dishonour of cheque was already issued to that effect.Thus, while doing the aforesaid transactions (qua sale deeds) on 13.12.1999, it could be presumed that there might be talks about dishonour of cheque, but such is not the case of the complainant. Further, it emerges from the record that the complainant had availed Rs.3 lakh cash for transaction, which means no dues qua land or home. Thus, eventually, the learned trial Judge has opined that it cannot be overruled that the cheque was given for security. Further, the respondent - accused has also examined independent witnesses and considering their depositions in detail, the learned trial Judge has come to the conclusion that defence of accused is probable. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case, the learned trial Judge has come to the conclusion that the debt cannot be said to be the legally enforceable debt, which is sine qua non in such matters and the complainant has failed to prove the same beyond reasonable doubt. 6.2 Further, under Sections 118(a) and 139 of the NI Act, there are provisions as regards presumption. At this juncture, a beneficial reference may be made to a decision of the Apex Court in Basalingappa v. Mudibasappa, MANU/SC/0502/2019 : (2019) 5 SCC 418 : AIR 2019 SC 1983, wherein, the Court has observed as under: Thus, the presumption Under Section 139 is a rebuttable presumption and the onus is on the accused to raise the probable defence. The standard of proof for rebutting the presumption is that of preponderance of probabilities. In the instant case, the accused has succeeded in rebutting the presumption, showing preponderance of probability by leading evidence and hence, onus shifts upon the complainant to prove otherwise, however, as said earlier, the complainant has failed to prove that the cheque was drawn towards legally enforceable debt. Further, after due appreciation of evidence, the learned trial Judge has come to the conclusion that the cheque and sale deed for the home appear to have been given for security purpose since the possession of land was not given. Accordingly, when the respondent - accused has succeeded in rebutting the presumption, the learned trial Judge has rightly come to the conclusion that the said provision would be of no help to the complainant.4. On re-appreciation and reevaluation of the ocular and the documentary evidence on record, it transpires that the complainant has failed to prove the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt inasmuch as the ingredients of the offence alleged are not fulfilled. Appeal dismissed",

    "Similar_Cases_Analysis": "\n### **Similar Case 1:**\n**Case ID**: 633ffa4f498bd6a9795e9ba2\n**Facts**: In the complaint filed by the present appellant under Section 200 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, against the present respondents, for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'N.I.Act'), the learned XVI Addl.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru City, (hereinafter for brevity referred to as 'trial Court'), by the judgment dated 26.05.2010, passed in C.C.No.11342/2009, acquitted the respondents/accused of the said offence. Aggrieved by the same, the complainant/appellant has preferred the present appeal. The summary of the case of the complainant in the trial Court is that accused Nos.1 and 2 (respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein) have jointly borrowed a hand loan of a sum of Rs. 4 lakhs from him. Towards the repayment of the said loan amount, the accused issued a cheque bearing No.282221, dated 29.1.2009, drawn on Karnataka Bank Ltd., Sarakki Layout Branch, Bengaluru, for a sum of Rs. 4 lakhs. When the complainant presented the cheque to his Banker for realisation, the same came to be dishonoured for the reason of \"insufficiency of funds\". Thereafter, the complainant demanding the payment of the cheque amount, issued a legal notice to the accused, who did not meet the demand made in the notice, which constrained the complainant to institute a case against them for the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act in the trial Court. The respondents who were the accused in the trial Court appeared and contested the matter. In order to prove the guilt of the accused, the complainant got himself examined as PW-1 and got marked documents from Exs.P-1 to P-8. On behalf of the accused, accused No.1 was examined as DW-1 and accused No.2 as DW-2 and got marked one document at Ex.D-1. In view of the fact that the learned counsel for both parties failed to appear before this Court on several dates of hearing and also considering the fact that this appeal was ten years old appeal, this Court by its order dated 14.9.2020, appointed learned counsel Smt.P.V.Kalpana, as Amicus Curiae for the appellant and learned counsel Sri D.Nagaraja Reddy, as Amicus Curiae for the respondent.\n**Ruling by Lower Court**:  After hearing both side, the trial Court by its impugned judgment dated 26.05.2010, acquitted the accused of the offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act.\n**Argument by Petitioner**:  Learned Amicus Curiae for the appellant in her arguments submitted that the evidence of PW-1 clearly demonstrate that he had the source of income and financial capacity to lend the money. His income from coconut business, chit business and bank balance would clearly show his financial capacity. However, the trial Court only on the ground that he had no financial capacity to lend money, has acquitted the accused of the alleged offence. Learned Amicus Curiae for the appellant further submitted that, when PW-1 in his cross-examination has stated that he was not in talking terms with the accused since December 2008, then how can it is possible for him to steal the cheque in the year 2009. She also submitted that non-filing of any police complaint by the accused also shows that they had issued the cheque in question to the son-in-law i.e., the complainant for the loan taken by them.\n**Argument by Respondent**: . Learned Amicus Curiae for the respondents in his brief arguments submits that, admittedly the parties stand in close relationship with each other. By stealing a cheque from the accused, the complainant has presented the same before his Banker and after its dishonour, has filed the case only to harass his close relatives. The evidence led by the parties disclose that the complainant had no financial capacity to lend the loan which is claimed by him. Thus, the trial Court has rightly acquitted the accused of the alleged offence.  The contention of the accused in the form of defence was that the complainant being their relative was visiting their house frequently till January 2009. As such, during one such visit, he had taken without their knowledge a signed blank cheque from the cheque book belonging to them. \n**Citation Context**:  The law of any foreign country regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques shall be presumed to be the same as that of 2India, unless and until the contrary is proved .

Heard the arguments of learned Amicus Curiae from both side and perused the materials placed before this Court. The complainant got himself examined as PW-1, who in his examination-in-chief filed in the form of affidavit evidence has reiterated the contentions taken up by him in his complaint. In support of his contention, he got marked the original cheque which was dishonoured as Ex.P-1, the signature of accused Nos.1 and 2 therein at Ex.P-1(a) and Ex.P-1(b) respectively.  He got marked the Banker's endorsement for dishonouring the cheque at Ex.P-2, two postal receipts at Exs.P-3 and P-4, copy of the legal notice said to have been issued on his behalf to the accused at Ex.P-5, the Certificate of Posting at Ex.P-6, reply to the notice said to have been given by the accused at Ex.P-7, and returned postal cover addressed to the counsel for the complainant who issued the legal notice on his behalf, at Ex.P-8. Accused Nos.1 and 2 were examined as DW-1 and DW-2 respectively, who got produced an invitation card of their house warming ceremony at Ex.D-1. Both DW-1 and DW-2 in their evidence have stated that the complainant is their relative, who is a coconut vendor. They have stated that the complainant was visiting their house frequently till January 2009. In between the said period, without their knowledge, he had taken a signed blank cheque from the cheque book of their joint account and after filling the same, he has presented the said cheque before his Banker only to get it dishonoured. They denied that they have availed loan from the complainant for constructing their house. Stating that in April 2007 itself, the house warming ceremony was performed by them, they have produced an invitation card of house warming ceremony of their house at Ex.D-1. Both these witnesses were cross-examined from the complainant side, wherein they stated that with respect to the alleged theft of their cheque, they had not given the police complaint. A perusal of the evidence led from both side go to show that the parties to the case have admitted their relationship. PW-1 himself has stated that, by relation, accused No.1 is his mother-in-law and accused No.2 is his father-in-law. The evidence led by the parties also shows an undisputed fact that the accused are the drawers of the cheque at Ex.P-1. The said cheque was issued from a joint account said to be belonging to the accused. It is also not in dispute that the said cheque was presented for its realisation by the complainant and the same got dishonoured for 'insufficiency of funds' as could be seen from the Banker's endorsement at Ex.P-2. It is also not in dispute that after dishonour of the cheque, the complainant got issued a legal notice to the accused through his Advocate as could be seen from its copy at Ex.P-5. The accused have replied to the said notice as could be seen at Ex.P-7. However, the accused have denied that the cheque at Ex.P-1 was issued by them to the complainant towards any legally enforceable debt. Thus, the question remains for consideration would be whether the complainant would show that the cheque was issued to him by the accused and whether he had the capacity to lend the cheque amount as loan to the accused.  PW-1 in his evidence has stated that he has been doing the coconut business since ten years prior to the date of his evidence. His annual income is from Rs. 30,000/- to Rs. 40,000/-. He has also stated that, apart from coconut business, he was doing chit business and other business, from which he has accumulated money. He had kept about Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 lakhs in his bank account in State Bank of India also. He further stated that since the accused were putting up the construction of their house, they availed loan from him, for which, he gave a loan of Rs. 4 lakhs as required by them and has not obtained any documentation in that regard because they were his close relatives. He has specifically denied that he had stolen the cheque from their house. In the very same cross-examination, the complainant has also stated that he has not been in talking terms with the accused from the year 2008. It is the evidence of the complainant that the accused, who are his relatives, since had undertaken to put up construction of their house, had borrowed a sum of Rs. 4 lakhs from him. The said evidence that the accused in the year 2007 and 2008 were putting up construction of their house is also the evidence of DW-1 and DW-2. The accused themselves have produced the invitation of house warming ceremony at Ex.D-1 which go to show that in April 2007, they performed the house warming ceremony of their newly built house. According to the complainant/PW-1, the alleged loan given by him to the accused was in March 2007, which means, a month prior to the house warming ceremony of the accused. Therefore, the complainant could able to show the purpose for which the loan was said to have been availed by the accused from him. he complainant has totally denied the said suggestion made to him in his cross-examination, as well he has denied the same even in the cross-examination of DW-1 and DW-2. The said defence taken by the accused about the cheque in question reaching the complainant requires a detailed analysis. The cheque at Ex.P-1 is dated 29.1.2009. It is not the case of the accused that the complainant has put the date according to his convenience or that the cheque was given for a future date by the accused themselves. Therefore, it has to be necessarily inferred that the said cheque came in the hand of the complainant in January 2009 only. The said presumption also is required to be drawn under Section 118 of N.I.Act also. According to the accused, the complainant was visiting their house frequently till January 2009. The complainant has denied the same.  On the other hand, the complainant in his evidence as PW-1 clearly stated that during December 2008, himself and the accused are not in talking terms. The said statement of PW-1 has not been denied by the accused. Therefore, when the accused was not in talking terms with the complainant from December 2008 itself, how come he can go to the house of the accused in January 2009 and take the cheque in question without their consent or knowledge remains as a question not answered by the accused. Therefore, the contention of the accused that the complainant had taken the cheque in question without their notice or knowledge in January 2009 cannot be accepted as a probability and it does not weaken the case of the complainant. . According to the accused, the complainant who was visiting their house till January 2009, had taken the cheque at Ex.P-1 without their knowledge or consent and that the said cheque was duly signed by them. Neither the accused have any where stated as to what made them to keep a blank signed cheque in their house, that too, in a manner as to easily accessible to any of the visitor to their house, nor the accused have even attempted to give any clarification or explanation or details in that regard. Therefore, it is not enough for the accused to take a mere defence to rebut the presumption operating in favour of the complainant, but, it is required of the accused to show it to the Court that the defence taken by them are more probable and sufficient to rebut the presumption operating in favour of the complainant. The defence taken by the accused in this case since by itself is with lot of infirmities as observed above, the said contention of the accused cannot be taken as probable and as sufficient to rebut the presumption operating in favour of the complainant. This aspect the trial Court has not considered and has not appreciated in the light of the evidence led by the parties. The argument of learned Amicus Curiae for the respondents/accused was that the complainant had no capacity to lend money. Incidentally, the trial Court too has acquitted the accused after observing that the complainant in order to prove his financial capacity to lend money, should have produced his bank passbook or bank account statement, which he has not done and no cogent evidence was placed to show his capacity. As such, it opined that, he had no capacity to lend money, which leads to draw an inference that there existed no legally enforceable debt. On the said point, if we analyse the evidence of the parties, the evidence of the complainant, both his examination-in-chief and his cross-examination, would go to show that he was having income not from a single source, but, by multiple sources. Admittedly, he was a coconut vendor. In addition to that, he has also stated that he has involved in chit business, from which, he has gathered money. He further stated that he had kept amount in his back account with State Bank of India. The said statement of the complainant that he had income from three sources has not been specifically denied in his further cross-examination. Therefore, it is the accused themselves who have elicited the details of the income from the accused and have remained silent without denying the details given by him to show that he had the capacity to lend the cheque amount to the accused. However, the trial Court without noticing that the evidence about the income led by the complainant has remained undenied, has proceeded further expecting the complainant to produce the documents to prove his contention of having financial capacity. The expectation of the trial Court from the complainant to produce the documents to prove his financial capacity was not warranted in the circumstances of the case as analysed above. When the accused themselves have not chosen to question the source of income and financial capacity as given by the complainant, the trial Court need not had to further probe into the matter regarding the financial capacity of the complainant. \n",
    "Finetuned_Generated_Analysis": "ALLOWED\n\nThe appeal is allowed. The lower court erred in its interpretation of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act. The cheque in question was duly signed by the accused, came to be dishonoured when presented before the bank for insufficiency of funds, and was issued for discharge of a legal liability towards the complainant. The legal notice upon the respondent was issued within the stipulated time. The accused failed to rebut the onus of proof and the statutory presumption against him. The lower court's judgment is vitiated by a manifest illegality."

    "Case_Inputs": "Facts:\nSince common question of law is involved in both of these cases, they are heard together and are being disposed of by this common order. The petitioner/complainant filed a complaint against the respondent/accused under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter, \"the NI Act\") stating inter alia that in discharge of his liability towards the petitioner/complainant, on 04/11/2008, the respondent/ accused issued a cheque bearing No. 728602 of the Durg Rajnandgaon Gramin Bank Branch Kawardha for Rs. 1,50,000/.  The petitioner/complainant presented the said cheque to his Bank on the next day i.e. 05/11/2008 and it was dishonoured and was returned to him on the same day. Thereafter, the petitioner/complainant issued a notice to the respondent/accused on 10/11/2008 by registered post which was served to him on 21/11/2008. The respondent/accused still did not pay the amount in dispute which led to the filing of the complaint by the petitioner/complainant before the jurisdictional criminal Court. .The respondent/accused abjured his guilt and entered into defence and examined himself as defence witness stating inter alia that he had signed a blank cheque with relation to an earlier transaction regarding the repair work of his tractor and it has been misused by the petitioner/ complainant and even the particulars of the cheque were not filled by him.  Feeling aggrieved by the order of conviction passed by the trial Court and the sentence imposed therein, the respondent/accused preferred an appeal before the Court of Sessions. The petitioner/complainant also preferred a revision against the order of the trial Court for enhancement of the sentence as well as fine imposed upon the respondent/accused .The instant petition as well as the acquittal appeal, both have been filed by the petitioner/ complainant against the order of the Sessions Court acquitting the respondent/accused and dismissing the revision for enhancement of sentence as well as fine imposed by the trial Court upon the respondent/accused\nArgument by the Petitioner:\nMr. Awadh Tripathi, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner/complainant, would submit that learned Additional Session Judge is absolutely unjustified in holding that the petitioner/ complainant has failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/ accused in discharge of his debt or liability, as there is a presumption under Section 139 of the NI Act though it is a rebuttable presumption and the burden of proof lies upon the drawer of the cheque by adducing rebuttal evidence to prove that he did not issue the cheque towards any antecedent liability.  He would further submit that the respondent/accused having admitted his signature on the blank cheque cannot disown his liability by asserting that the cheque has been misused and he has not filled the particulars of the cheque, as such, the impugned order passed the Additional Sessions Judge reversing the order of conviction of the respondent/accused for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act passed by the trial Court deserves to be set aside and the order dismissing the revision petition also deserves to be set aside\nArgument by the Respondent:\n.Mr. Vikas Pandey, learned counsel appearing for the respondent/accused, would support the impugned order passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge by which he has acquitted the respondent/accused holding that the petitioner/complainant has failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/accused in discharge of his liability is a finding based on evidence available on record, as such, the appellate Court has rightly acquitted the respondent/ accused for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act.\nRuling by the Lower Court:\nLearned trial Court, after evaluation of oral and documentary evidence on record, convicted the respondent/accused vide order dated 05/11/2011 for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act and sentenced him to imprisonment for one year and simultaneously also imposed a fine of Rs. 5,000/ upon him and also prescribed a default sentence in case the fine is not deposited by him.  Eventually, learned Additional Sessions Judge allowed the appeal of the respondent/accused vide impugned order dated 10/07/2012 and set aside the order of conviction passed by the trial Court and also dismissed the revision of the petitioner/complainant\n",
    "Case_Result": "10. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, considered their rival submissions made herein above and perused the records with utmost circumspection.As noticed hereinabove, the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/accused on 04/11/2008 in favour of the petitioner/complainant for Rs. 1,50,000/ which was presented by the petitioner/complainant before his Bank on 05/11/2008 and the same day it stood dishonoured.Thereafter, in order to institute the complaint under Section 138 of the NI Act, the petitioner/ complainant issued a notice on 10/11/2008 which was served to the respondent/accused on 21/11/2008. Since no reply to the notice was filed by the respondent/accused, the petitioner/ complainant filed a complaint against him under Section 138 of the NI Act in which cognizance was taken against him for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act and the respondent/accused having entered into defence, denied the charges and took a specific defence that though he had no debt or liability towards the petitioner/complainant but yet he had signed a blank cheque in relation to some other earlier transaction..Section 139 of the NI Act mandates that unless the contrary is proved, it is to be presumed that the holder of the cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in Section 138 for the discharge in whole or in part of any debt or other liability. However, the presumption is rebuttable by proving to the contrary. Section 139 of the NI Act introduces an exception to the general rule as to the burden of proof and shifts the onus on the accused to prove by cogent evidence that there was no debt or liability. Mere denial or rebuttal by the accused is not enough.In the instant case, no evidence has been adduced by the respondent/accused in rebuttal of the presumption enumerated under Section 139 of the NI Act showing that he had not drawn the cheque in question in favour of the petitioner/complainant for Rs. 1,50,000/ in discharge of his liability towards the petitioner/complainant. As such, learned Additional Sessions Judge failed to notice the presumption as is available under Section 139 of the NI Act and is absolutely unjustified in holding that the petitioner/complainant has failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/accused in discharge of his debt or liability, as such, th finding recorded by learned Additional Session Judge deserves to be set aside.Now, coming to the next contention of learned counsel for the respondent/accused that the respondent/accused had signed a blank cheque and had not even filled the particulars of the cheque which has been misused by the petitioner/complainant, therefore, he is not liable to pay the petitioner/complainant further. Reverting to the facts of the present case in light of the principle of law laid down by Their Lordships of the Supreme Court in Bir Singh (supra), it is a case of the respondent/accused from day one that he had signed a blank cheque and other particulars of the cheque were not even filled by him rather by the petitioner/complainant who has misused the cheque in question. Learned trial Court convicted the respondent/accused for offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act finding the ingredients of the same which was reversed by the appellate Court primarily on the ground that the petitioner/complainant has failed to prove that the cheque in question was issued by the respondent/accused in discharge of his existing liability towards the petitioner/complainant. Order accordingly",
