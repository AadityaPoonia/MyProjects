-- SanctiSight — See Risk Before It Strikes
-- Google Cloud x Kaggle BigQuery AI Hackathon 2025
--
-- Objective:
--   Detect relationships between global news entities (GDELT)
--   and sanctioned entities (OFAC/OpenSanctions) using
--   semantic embeddings + vector search in BigQuery ML.

-- Stack:
--   • BigQuery + Vertex AI (text-multilingual-embedding-002)
--   • ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING + VECTOR_SEARCH + CREATE VECTOR INDEX
